"SAMSUNG Galaxy Tab A8 10.5‚Äù 32GB Android Tablet w/ LCD Screen, Long Lasting Battery, Kids Content, Smart Switch, Expandable Memory, US Version, Silver, Amazon Exclusive",5.0,Bought for Gaming - Works Great,"Reviewed in the United States üá∫üá∏ on April 12, 2023",Color: Silver | Size: 64GB,True,"If you're looking for a good gaming tablet with little to no fuss and happiness, ignore the year this thing came out. It's still top notch!We've only had this about a month. I'll need to update this review down the line, but I wanted to get the basic review up for anyone looking like I was.Hubby plays one game. ONE. He plays an MMO game with RTS that is persistent, meaning it continues even when he isn't logged in. Lags are literally deadly to his account. I hate reviews that say ""I play games"" but don't tell you if the game is an MMO or freaking Wordle/Solitaire, so I'm making it clear.All that said, his eyesight isn't the greatest, and he needed a size-up from his phone. He decided this was what he wanted. He ADORES it!Great picture quality, fantastic battery life, no lag to speak of that isn't from the game server itself, gorgeous sound that will terrify your other half if you forget you had it turned up and randomly start playing something at 2am while laying next to them!It has an extra memory slot, but as he is only playing the one game for now, I haven't installed the card I bought for it, so I can't speak to that as yet.The only complaint I have is that his game field doesn't expand when turning the tablet to landscape. It stays the same size it would be on his phone. When playing the game on the PC, the field is enlarged. On this tablet, you don't get that. Whatever Google has set up for a mobile game is what you'll see. However, it'll still be larger and easier to see because the tablet is larger than your phone, so there is that!I hope this helps you decide!",8 people found this helpful

It has some issues that you need to work around like the sign in screen where you need to be able to see the numbers to sign in, but that can be changed to facial acceptance. Overall, it‚Äôs relatively easy to work with if you‚Äôve had an analog phone otherwise it takes a while. You cannot set this up if you can‚Äôt see so far I‚Äôve had two people help me along the way with simple things to get over some speed bumps that are in there  But they probably spend 10 minutes for one person and a half hour for the other person so you can set it up pretty much as a visually impaired person because of the voice over speak feature. Again it‚Äôs not simple it‚Äôs not 100% wonderful but it‚Äôs doable and if you just take the time and work on it over a few days, rather than trying to get it all done in one day you‚Äôll be better off and less aggravated. Amazon does provide an 800 number for assistance. I have not called it yet , but I will in the future if I need to. Overall, I am satisfied with the device for the price and it is a great secondary device to my primary device if that makes sense.

"SAMSUNG Galaxy Tab A8 10.5‚Äù 32GB Android Tablet w/ LCD Screen, Long Lasting Battery, Kids Content, Smart Switch, Expandable Memory, US Version, Silver, Amazon Exclusive",2.0,Amazon Was Great,"Reviewed in the United States üá∫üá∏ on March 19, 2022",Color: Silver | Size: 64GB,True,"Updated 9/21/22Beware the model they send you.  There is more than one model of the TabA8.  Unfortunately I received model SM-X200.  The Samsung updates to this model are horrendous and as a result pose a security risk to the user.  it is still on Android 11, One UI 3.1 and Android May 2022 security patch.I read somewhere, not confirmed that Samsung is not updating this model of the TabA8 to Android 12 and may update it to Android 13 at some point in time after Android 13 becomes available.I also have a TabA7 released one year before the TabA8  and Samsung updated my TabA7 to Android 12 months ago.  Also, Samsung keeps the TabA7 up to date on Android Security patchesThe TabA8 works fine that is why I am not giving it a one star rating  It is also very slow to charge.  A lot slower than the TabA7.I can not recommend the SM-X200 model of the TabA8 at all.  Maybe if you are in a different location this model of the TabA8 will update.Updated 3/22/22 See bottom of reviewNot reviewed for typos.I ordered a 4 x 64 version.  The box said 4 x 64.  The actual device as a 3 x 32.  I contacted Amazon about the problem and they sent the correct replaement immediately and I received the replacement on the same date that i was scheduled to receive the originalNow about the Tab A8.  I had previously purchased a Tab A7 3 x 64 from Amazon.  You should be able to find my review of it on Amazon.  This review is bascially a comparison of the A8 with the A7.First off.  I recommend against buying the A8, 3 x 32  It wasn't unitl I had used Switch to copy over my apps and data from the A7 to the original A8 that I received that I discovered they had sent me a 3 x 32 intead of a 4 x 64.  If you order the 64GB version of the A8 it automatically comes with 4GB RAM.In any case the transfer of the apps and data from the A7 3 x 64 to the A8 3 x 32 took close to two hours using Samsung Switch.  Transferring the data from the A7 to the A8, 4 x 64 took less than 15 minutes.  There is no doubt that the extra 1GB  RAM and 32GB of memory makes a big difference.  The Tab A7 with 64GB is a very nice tablet but compared to the Tab A8 with 64GB the Tab 8A is signficantly faster.  I opened multiple apps and switched between them without any lag.As I have posted before I am no gamer so I can't comment of the gaming capabilities of either tablet but when it comes to everything else including downloading and installing updates the Tab A8 64GB is noticeably faster than the Tab A7 64GBThe display comparison is bit more complicated.  The sharpness of the display is better on the A7 but the Tab A8 display at 10.5"" vs 10.4"" of the Tab A7 is more boxy and looks more like a desktop display than a tablet display.  I put up a video on the Tab A8 and a 23"" Samsung desktop display monitor.  While some of the picture is lost on the Tab A8 it isn't a lot compared to the Tab A7 which crops off a good deal of the top and bottom.For some reason, the Tab A7 has a better; i.e., signficantly louder audio than the Tab A8 both running on Android 11 with Samsung UI 3.1.  The Tab A8 audio is good for watching videos etc but the Tab A7 can give you room type audio when you are listening to music.  I can't judge the distortion but in any case while the Tab 8A audio is fine the Tab A7 audio is better.While neither the Tab A7 or A8 batteries will charge very fast I haven't noticed much diffenece between the two with the Tab A8 charging a bit faster using the Samsung charging block and cable that came with the Tab A8.  No comment on battery draing speed as that will always vary based upon usage.  I ams satisfied with the battery drain speed on both the Tab A7 and Tab A8,  Then again I don't play games.Final comment.  The Tab A8 is year newer so it came with Android 11 vs Android 10 for Tab A7.  So it should get one more Android update and Samsung related UI update down the road.  Both are nice tablets but the extra GB of RAM along with a different CPU makes the Tab A8 a lot more enjoyable to use.Update 3/22/22Heptics -  The heptics on the Tab A8 are super sensitive which makes for very light touches.  On the Tab A7 the heptics are not nearly as sensitive.Startup -  With the Tab A8 there is very little impact on usage immediately upon startup after logging in.  Upon login you should be able to alsmost immediately begin doing whatever.  On the Tab A7 you have to wait for software like anti-malware to do their thing after login before you can do much of anything.  The wait time will vary depending on your software.For that reason I don't turn off the Tab A7 except when I know I won't be using it for an extended period, like a day or more.  I think the extra GB of RAM in the Tab A8 makes the difference since both my Tab A8 and Tab A7 are loaded with identical software including Android 11 and Samsung 3.1 UI.Battery - Samsung UI 3.1 does a good job of saving battery after it learns which takes a few days.  Therefore, leaving the Tab A8 or Tab A7 on does not drain much battery once the devices are optimized by the Samsung software as long as you turn off the display when the devices are not in use.  I also recommend turning off the display for playing music, streaming or otherwise if you want to save on battery drain.In order to assure continuous playing of music when the display is off you have go to the music playing app and turn on allow in battery saving mode.",156 people found this helpful
"SAMSUNG Galaxy Tab A8 10.5‚Äù 32GB Android Tablet w/ LCD Screen, Long Lasting Battery, Kids Content, Smart Switch, Expandable Memory, US Version, Silver, Amazon Exclusive",3.0,"Not the best, not terrible, kinda a solid okay-ish","Reviewed in the United States üá∫üá∏ on March 19, 2022",Color: Silver | Size: 64GB,True,"The Samsung A8 is near bottom of the Samsung line up of tablets.  It comes in two memory sizes, 3gb and 4gb versions starting at 64gb of storage.  Let me start by saying, there is no reason whatsoever to buy the 32gb variant as it comes with only 3gb of physical ram.  That extra gig of ram is what makes this tablet worth the money.  I only recommend the 4gb variant, and find the 64gb storage model is really the sweet spot with this tablet.  So let's get into the review.The first thing I noticed is the weight.  It is a heavy tablet.  This is not a deterrent to me as I do most of my gaming using an Xbox controller (bluetooth) so I am not holding onto the tablet for long periods of time.  This is good because the weight of it becomes cumbersome very quickly.  The 10.5"" screen is good, not great, but good.  The tablet resolution, while not fantastic does allow HD playback on netflix.  This is a nice touch.  There is however, a one inch bezel round the screen.  This makes the tablet look dated, as the era of large bezels is well beyond us.  The only good thing about such large bezels is it gives the user a place to put their fingers when holding onto the tablet.  The screen is quite bright, although the glossy surface does make use in bright environments difficult.  My biggest issue with the screen is that it does not brighten or darken well when there is a change of lighting environment.  This is a feature we have become used to, so it feels like a real miss in terms of ease of use.There are four speakers on this tablet on top and bottom (portrait mode) and they get quite loud.  Don't expect audiophile quality here, but they do the trick, and were able to create a wide soundstage when watching a movie.  I would recommend the use of a quality earphone solution.  I use QE2 monitor headphones and the sound was much better.  There is no EQ baked into the OS, which is a letdown.There are few buttons on the side, a volume rocker, power switch and an earphone jack as well as USB C charging.  It does support Bluetooth, which is good.  I was able to have music playing on the tablet, and wash dishes in the kitchen while the tablet remained in the living room without any loss in signal.  I also used it at the laundromat, with the tablet in a backpack, and was able to stay connected.  One thing that is missing with the Bluetooth is hearing aid compatibility.  While I can download the hearing aid app, connecting my aids to the tablet is another thing.  Most hearing aid connections are established through the accessibility options in settings, however, Samsung chose not to include any hearing aid connections in their accessibility options.  This is a huge miss.  Those of us who are reliant upon hearing aids will find their experience reduced as a result.  Considering this connection is just a software fix, not having it is a huge middle finger to the deaf community.  Shame on you Samsung.  The battery life is okay, but when connected to a 30 watt charger, it did recharge quite quickly.  Unfortunately it comes with a very low wattage wall wart, so I recommend buying a higher wattage charger.This comes with Android 11.  I installed a few apps such as the Kindle app which surprisingly works much better as an app then the native program on the Kindle HD 10.  I also installed a few games, Asphalt 9, Castle Wreck, Bubble shooter and Klondike Forever and lastly the You Version Bible app. None of those apps besides  the kindle were available in the Kindle app store.  All the apps worked well enough, although Castle Wreck did cause the tablet to slow down due to the amount of rendering involved in that game, and the low amount of physical ram.So why should you buy this tablet?  If you don't want to pay for a pad from another fruity company, but want more than can be had from the Kindle HD 10 this is for you.  That is really the best comparison to The Samsung A8.  Provided you purchase a 4gb model, it functions much better than the HD 10, the biggest advantage is native access to the Google Play Store, and a full fat version of Android 11.  Don't expect a feature rich tablet like the S line of Samsung, but if you are interested in light web browsing, casual gaming and reading, as well as streaming media playback, this tablet will work well.So in the end, this tablet is a good enough introduction to the tablet market.  With the affordable price, it is a good tablet for children, classrooms with a good screen protector and case, or for that family member who could use a tablet, but would not have the use of a more expensive unit.  I started this review by recommending only the 4gb models, (64/128 storage).  Believe me, you will notice a difference.  4gb of ram is quite low by today's standards, and you will notice that in the performance.  Web pages refresh a little to quickly, and after a day of use, the tablet will become noticeably slower, requiring a reboot.  This can be mitigated a bit by fully shutting off programs, (swiping up, and swiping away open programs) as well as limiting notifications.  As of now, there is no indication that Samsung intends to update this tablet to Android 12, but perhaps there will be a work around.  Be careful, as the A8 is very low in specifications, and forcing a newer OS unintended for the product might cause it to age quicker then designed.Overall the A8 does meet my needs, and while not wonderful in any way, it gets the job done under $400, which is a plus.",498 people found this helpful

The best aspect is that I did not purchase it through a wireless service carrier, so lots of junk programs/apps/bloatware which a carrier would install were not present. That alone made it a worthwhile purchase.I expected an excellent Android-based tablet, and it has not failed to deliver as a portable entertainment center (reading PDFs/ebooks, streaming video, a few games) and for electronic communications. The larger screen, greater storage capacity (both internal and via SD card), more RAM and better CPU make this tablet a great experience. I have not encountered any issues with it so far, after a few months of usage, it has performed admirably as expected. For context, I also use a Samsung mobile phone. My older Samsung mobile is still in use as a camera and audio recorder, and I still use the older tablet as well. Samsung... works quite well for me.My preference for a tablet protector is to avoid integrated flip-over covers; those are just annoying. As with my past tablet, I use a Unicorn Beetle armored cover which comes with an integrated backstand, tactile rubberized margins, protective screen insert and a sturdy polymer shell.",60 people found this helpful

"SAMSUNG Galaxy Tab A8 10.5‚Äù 32GB Android Tablet w/ LCD Screen, Long Lasting Battery, Kids Content, Smart Switch, Expandable Memory, US Version, Silver, Amazon Exclusive",3.0,touch screen is too problematic as a design feature.,"Reviewed in the United States üá∫üá∏ on February 18, 2023",Color: Silver | Size: 32GB,True,"I bought this device for my Neice to use to occupy her child when she has things to do. This device did not survive a toddlers use very long because, of touch screen design flaws.I prefer using a mouse and a keyboard with my PC and a basic standard mobile phone with a push button keypad and scroll buttons for the LED settings menu (if I could find one) rather than using touch screen devices because, when the touch screen is deactivated by constant swiping and or the decoupling of screen protectors, the devices touch feature cannot be readily repaired. When using a mouse or keyboard that wear out, you can replace them however when touch screen stops working, your only alternatives are to take it to a technician to repair it or you are forced to replace the entire device. Push button mobile phones are more reliable and not as easily damaged as these overly delicate so-called smart devices are. The push-button age should not be abandoned in favor of a touch screen age.  Tech companies need to abandon this touch screen technology altogether because it is not senior and toddler friendly. When vision and manual dexterity issues develop, touch screen devices are too difficult for a visually impaired 70-year-old stroke victim like me to use.  I would not recommend this overly delicate device for seniors, heavy-handed persons, or children under the age of three. Update: letting the battery power run down to 0% and then recharging the battery restored the tablet to full function. It seems that the device had locked out all touchscreen functions arbitrarily due to repetitive pin number entry requests that my niece's child had access to during regular use. The touchscreen restart and power off icons were locked out along with all other functions. Power off and restart should not be touchscreen activated only. There should be two small push buttons on the side of the device to facilitate a manual restart and power off in all new versions of this device so that users don't have to wait for the battery to die to restart the tablet. Touchscreen technology is too unreliable to use because of excessive security protocols and without access to these push button restoration features. Samsung and Apple designers should incorporate these features so that when touchscreen fails to work, you can rely on these push button restart and power off functions to reset it.",

Cool Streaming Device,"Reviewed in the United States üá∫üá∏ on December 4, 2022",Color: Silver | Size: 64GB,True,"During COVID lockdown, I've discovered an app that permits those who enjoy singing to safely stay at home & sing with others across the globe. However, this app requires an actual 3.5mm jack on the tablet device in order to accommodate ear loopback feature so one can hear his/her own voices while singing, just like any recording artist while giving a concert.My old Samsung Tab A 2019 was working great but took one to many falls and the screen broke. The new tablets have all but removed the 3.5mm jack & replaced with a USB Type-C connector. Despite having a Type-C to-3.5mm jack, my singing voices had a delay & always come out about 1-2 seconds after the music had passed.In search of a replacement tablet with a 3.5mm jack (as the older pre-2019 models are hard to come by, only refurbished as they stopped making them!), I came across this Samsung Tab A8. Here's my reviews:PROSüëçüëç#1. Affordable: at about an $189 ( vs I found a refurbished Tab A 2019 model priced at $209!!) it's very affordably priced; especially for grandparents & small kids who don't really need the extra features#2. Quality: again, in comparison to other so-called Android generic tablets, often < $100, those are poorly built! You'd better off go with this brand name in Samsung &  backed by Amazon streaming devices#3. Ease of setup: simply power up & follow on-screen messages that will prompt & walk anyone - even those technically challenged, up and running very quicklyCONSüôÑüôÑ #1. TypcC-to-3.5mm: even those this adapter is provided, it had a delay of about 1-2 seconds.In summary , if your own needs require only YouTube watching, Streaming TV shows, etc and don't require any extra features, this Samsung Tab A8 is a good choice for Streaming purposes at very affordable price point. However, if like myself, you need the 3.5mm functionality for singing & recording needs, you may want to opt for something else.",84 people found this helpful

"SAMSUNG Galaxy Tab A8 10.5‚Äù 32GB Android Tablet w/ LCD Screen, Long Lasting Battery, Kids Content, Smart Switch, Expandable Memory, US Version, Silver, Amazon Exclusive",3.0,"32 GB internal storage and 3 GB RAM (memory), skip this version.","Reviewed in the United States on August 23, 2022",Color: Silver | Size: 32GB,True,"I bought the 32 GB internal storage and 3 GB RAM version, which is the cheapest model due to it being on sale. If this will be your go-to, main tablet then I would suggest upgrading to a version with more RAM and internal storage. Others say the 64 GB internal storage doesn't experience any studder performance with the device.  This 32 GB internal storage (3 GB RAM) studders through swipes and many other operations. I am still going to keep it though, because I only have a few purpose for this device.  Sufficient to use for reading books, but just make sure it's not under the bright sun. It allows me to watch YouTube TV, YouTube, Netflix, HBO Max, just fine, but I tell you I come from owning an old IPAD Air that does not even qualify for the latest IOS update today.  That IPAD is just as smooth if not smoother than this tablet, however due to the IOS (12.x) being outdated, it cannot run many applications. This Samsung SM-x200 A8 tablet can run all the applications that I want to use today. Here are the PROs and CONs from my perspective:PRO:- Newer device that runs most application today that I use.- External MicroSD card feature.- Cheap price, waaaaay cheaper than Apple Ipads.CON:- Studders with 32 GB internal storage and 3 GB RAM.- Screen brightness not that bright, but useable. Glossy screen reflects under the sun so probably not that great outdoors.Summary - Battery life is OK, I think it isn't that impressive but up to 8 hours+ of usage is not terrible. Upgrade to the higher internal storage/memory model versions to avoid studdering I guess, other reviewers say the tablet is better with more internal storage.  I believe with higher amount of internal storage, Samsung also increases the RAM to 4 GB RAM, but I'd double check before you buy on that information. The software applications installs on the internal storage, and I have not been able to figure out if they can be installed on the external MicroSD card.  On the other hand, you CAN move the data many or most of the ""data"" that the installed applications use to the external MicroSD card. Speakers are loud and clear, really like it. The WIFI connection is okay, but I bet overall tablet performance would be WAY better if there was slightly more RAM internally (3 GB vs 4 GB). This tablet supposedly is compatible with up to 1 TB of external MicroSD storage, and I have one on order that's arriving soon.  If is not compatible with the 1 TB MicroSD card, I will update my review and mention it, but I do not anticipate any problems.I do not use this tablet as my main source of electronic device though (I prefer my higher performance laptop), so this is why I will keep it even though I think the performance for this lower-tier performance device is a bit lacking. It works very well for watching streaming services, reading books and minor browsing. If you are okay with the studdering performance here and there, then this is an inexpensive product to have on a budget. It connects to my home network NAS just fine, I can plug in the USB-C power cord and let it stream news all day, no issues (for now). I'm sure after a few years this tablet will be obsolete just like my Ipad Air has become, but it will have served its purpose.",39 people found this helpful

This one works, it's perfect...mostly. I ordered the tablet with expandable memory (sd card drive). My tablet DOES have the slot, but it will not open and there doesn't appear to even be a release/pressure button to pop the drive open with the included slide release pin. It may be too late for me to return it (I should have checked this when it arrived), so just be wary and check what they send you BEFORE it's too late...If not for the DOA, delivery issues and (apparently) the incorrect model being sent to me, I would have given this a 5star rating.  =(",

I have an Amazon Fire HD 10 (2019) that limits my downloads and forces me to use their silk browser since Google cannot be installed on it. This Galaxy tablet and my Amazon tablet are both 32GB but there is a slight difference in performance. My Amazon tablet powers up after holding the button 3 seconds then loads in an additional 3 seconds whereas this Galaxy tablet, I have to hold the power button down for at 7 seconds then wait another 5 seconds for it to load. I have only added one android child (dragon) game on this Galaxy tab and it plays it well. Based on performance, this is a good tablet for occasionally surfing the internet and maybe one game but if you are wanting to play multiple games, you should go for the 64GB tablet.

Like HOURS long to charge it. I'm sure there are ""quick chargers"" out there and I may have to make the sacrifice because its kind of insane how long it takes to get a full battery again.

When I was finished, the tablet was only still at 87%.Other than the battery being subpar, this is an ok device for the money--there is also some really pesky terms of service things you have to agree to, in order to even use this thing-- super invasive, IMO, but likely if you are trying to buy a tablet, you don't care at all about privacy, or if every corporation on Earth sells you out to the highest bidder-- But that's a review for a completely separate occasion.It's cheaper than an ipad, but at what ultimate cost?

It's a good basic tablet with a decent picture and good battery life. One outstanding feature, the audio! This the best audio I have ever heard, stereo no less, coming from a tablet.Now to the downsides. Do not buy the 32gb model if you can at all avoid it. It is slow with very little storage for programs. I've read many complaints about Samsung not allowing you to store programs on a micro sd card.  This isn't strictly true as you can store certain programs on the micro sd card if the program itself allows it. Unfortunately, most programs don't allow it. Get all the base storage you can.To the more important feature...the wifi. I was perplexed as to why my download speeds on this unit were so slow...roughly a third of any of my other devices including much less expensive Amazon tablets. After extensive google research, I found an answer if a slightly inconvenient one. If you cycle the airline mode button (on then off) bammo, the speed jumps to a normal if not breathtaking level. It works every time, who knows why other than you are in essence resetting the wifi.All things considered, I'm keeping it especially after the recent Amazon sale.",102 people found this helpful

I wanted a tablet to read ebooks (I was tired of trying to read on a phone) and to stream movies and TV shows.Positive: The screen is large and clear, and even in with a screen protector it is responsive to taps and swipes. The system is not lightning fast but it is quick enough, and it streamed the first TV show I watched without buffering. The battery lasted 2 days of me playing with it the first time. It is lightweight and slim. I don't know if it's durable; since I drop things I put it in a rugged case to protect it. It came with Android 11, One UI Core 3.1, so I was able to install most my most important apps.Negative: NO FLASHLIGHT OR CAMERA FLASH. So it can't be used to take pictures at night or in poor lighting. I found this out when I turned out the the light in my room and went to put the flashlight on the tablet and, surprise, there isn't one! And the pictures taken with the tablet appear a little grainy when compared with a picture of the same scene taken by my Samsung S10 phone.Also at least one app that I can't install. When I look in Google Play for the Jenny Craig mobile app, it's not there! It installed on my phone and its specs say Android 6 and up, so I'm not sure why it would be incompatible with this device, it is an inconvenience.I've only had it for a week but overall I am pleased with it.",32 people found this helpful

I bought this tablet mainly to control the apps for my audio system because using my iPhone or Surface ties those devices up and if I walk out the room with them Tidal and other apps will quit streaming.Here‚Äôs what I like -- Easy set up- clear screen- thin and lightweight- works great for all audio apps including Amazon Music, Tidal music streaming, SVS subwoofer control app, Sony headphone app, HEOS for Denon, BluOs for my BluOs Node 2i, and Audacy to name a few.-USB C connector - none of the annoying Apple lightning connector nonsense and expense. I think Apple is being forced to change the lightning connector in 2023 thanks to the European Union ruling.What I don‚Äôt like-wish the battery were more robust. It seems to need charging more than I thought it would. It helps to close out all back ground apps when powering the tablet off.- Slippery case - I added a protective case- the facial recognition is not refined, it can be hit or miss- a little annoying to type on because the typing screen is not large. I have a Bluetooth keyboard for longer typing sessionsOverall, this is a slick tablet and it‚Äôs got exactly what I need for my audio system and the odd foray into the web.

I like the brightness, I usually hardly ever have to turn up the brightness beyond about 15% of maximum!I don‚Äôt like the slow processor it it. There are lots of slow app loadings, stutters.  The colors are muted and just ‚Äòoff‚Äù.  The boot times are abysmal. Takes forever and a day.  Also, upgrading apps takes a huge amount of time, crazy long compared to an iPhone 7 Plus (2016) or Samsung A53 (2022). The Unisoc chip is a joke, especially with what Samsung is charging for this device.  I will not be buying another Samsung tablet.They, and it is Samsung, keep you from off loading your apps onto a microSD card. Android lets you, it‚Äôs Samsung that neuters this functionality. The reason they give is that it would degrade performance. This might have been true in 2005, but not in 2022. MicroSD card read write speeds are hugely improved. And with A1 or A2 certified cards, random read/write speeds are extremely fast. And the Unisoc chip is the bottleneck, not the storage here. So, if you want one of these, get one on a deep discount, if at all.  And if you get one thinking that you can put apps on your card, think again!  Oh, 32GB models?  Really Samsung?  After the OS and a few additional programs there isn‚Äôt much left for storage.  NO ONE in the year 2022 should be putting any computing device out there with anything less than 128GB of onboard storage.  Oh, and why are we still waiting for Android 12 in September of 2022?!  Really?  Android 12 was already out when this device was released!Next time, I will save my money and buy an iPad.  It‚Äôs updated faster, has more, better apps, that are better vetted.  Or I‚Äôll save a lot of money and buy a cheap Lenovo or something. They at least will let me offload apps to microSD.

At streaming videos at full brightness for a couple hours I was down from a full charge to mid-80.  The wifi antenna is strong, I'm getting a good signal in parts of the house I used to avoid streaming.Where it fails is sound quality from the speakers (they're a bit tinny), and it's a tad heavy, but it is a bigger tablet than I had before.

If I'm watching something on anything but medium-low brightness, and I plug the tablet in, it discharges quicker than it charges.

I have an older Samsung tablet that I was assuming this would be a perfect replacement for. Things you should know:1- Yes, you can add a memory card, but you can‚Äôt save apps or games to this. It can only save files like pictures, documents, etc. if you want to expand your ability to save apps, get the model with the biggest memory.2- You can set up visual unlock, but it still wants the password if it‚Äôs been more than an hour or 2 since you accessed it. Very frustrating.3- I really wanted this for mirroring the screen to my tv. It does do this, but Samsung changed the way to access this, and there‚Äôs nothing online or in the included manual that explains how to do it. I had to figure it out on my own by fiddling with it for a few hours.Overall, I guess it‚Äôs worth it. However, it I could go back in time I‚Äôd buy the model with the bigger memory instead of saving $80 and buying the cheap one & a 256gb memory card.

We are a Samsung family. We have Samsung smart phones, and watches, so when my wife's old iPad finally gave up the ghost, I asked her if it would be OK to replace it with a Galaxy tablet, which made sense to me. We are both retired so I searched for a tablet that fit our budget and at the same time would fit her needs. She mainly streams and saves recipes, so I purchased the 128 GB model since it also included the 4 GB RAM, instead of 3 GB. What a tablet. The screen is bright, the sound with the quad speakers is fantastic, and it is quick. I have yet to set it up so she can make, and receive phone calls on it, which I think she will like.A day after we received it there was a huge update. It is now running Android 12, the same as our phones. The only disappointment I have found so far is not being able to connect her watch to it. I hopeSamsung addresses this in the future.If you are in the market for a high-end budget tablet you might give the A8 a second thought. I believe you will be pleased.",91 people found this helpful

This tablet does everything I wanted and is extremely affordable compared to other brands and models. It loaded all my apps from my other tablet's recent backup, can play 4K video footage from my NAS files, and has a pretty crisp bright screen. I tested 4K video playback with clips around 1-5 GB in size. Plays and scrubbs perfectly using Solid Explorer as the file browser and MX Player as the video player. I use this tablet as a addition to my workstation setup which is a M1 Mac mini with 2 displays. Instead of adding a third display to my setup which would have required an external video card device I decided to just get a tablet. I use this tablet for mostly watching NAS videos and for monitoring the main stream news using my Hulu subscription. It works so good I might get a second tablet to have 2 TV channels going at the same time to replace my existing Samsung Galaxy Tab E 8-inch. The difference between 8 inch and 10 inch really isn't that bad it doesn't take up that much more desk space just a few more inches of desk space and you got a larger screen. I also plan on using this for traveling if needed. I can say the Tab A8 is really neat and a good product. It only took about a hour to setup and download the apps and get me signed into everything with my passwords. Installing a SD card was super easy.",6 people found this helpful

It will run any game on the Google Play Store but expect some choppiness before the machine has it fully loaded and ""handling"" the software it's been asked to execute. But it CAN run it. I expected this from my $150 investment and this is why:Samsung Tablet Hardware VASTLY outlives Samsung's willingness to provide Google OS updates which eventually renders the tablet an unusable time capsule.I have owned Samsung tablets for a long time, pretty much since they made ones with styli (pens). The biggest problem with Samsung is they will only support the next year or two of Google's OS updates. Once they stop providing updates, the tablet is basically frozen in time. Apps will continue to get better and more complex, requiring new OS updates.But I still really like Samsung tablets. So I buy only when they are really cheap with the longest, promised by Samsung, years of OS updates. This makes them very disposable, which in turn makes Samsung a not very responsible manufacturer.I really hope that more people do like I do to force companies like Samsung to support their hardware for as long as the hardware can well run current applications.

"SAMSUNG Galaxy Tab A8 10.5‚Äù 32GB Android Tablet w/ LCD Screen, Long Lasting Battery, Kids Content, Smart Switch, Expandable Memory, US Version, Silver, Amazon Exclusive",3.0,Got the Samsung green screen,"Reviewed in the United States on October 5, 2022",Color: Dark Gray | Size: 32GB,True,"Pros: easy to set up since I have a Samsung Galaxy S21 plus phone. Comes loaded with Playstore, among other apps. (I purchased this tablet because I don't have access to Bally Sports app on my Kindle. I can access the Bally app on our Amazon firesticks with my cable TV code--go figure. I just prefer to watch hockey on a tablet and a lot of my fav NHL team's games will be on Bally exclusively this year). Processor adequate so there isn't blur when watching fast hockey game.  I dont know if that would carry over to playing video games or not.The A $15 Fintie cover fits perfectly and is easy to put on/take off the tablet.CONS: The green cast to the face of light-skinned people. It looks like the zombie apocalypse.  The only adustment available on the tablet that affects the green is the brightness. I found a spot on the brightness scale that is not too awful for purpose of watching sports but I'd never choose to watch movie/TV on the A8. Not only is the green an issue but overall color saturation and warmth is very inferior to my Kindle HD 10. The Kindle's picture is very comparable to the picture on my S21 plus in terms of color, warmth, and ""3-D-ness"" of the picture. The Samsung picture is overall flat and cheap-looking. Colors are muted. I don't want to pay for a more expensive tablet that would presumably have a better picture.  Apparently this isn't an issue that can be fixed because there's plenty of info online about the intractibility of the Samsung green screen problem.",One person found this helpful

With some caveats.It's suitable for watching videos if you can find a streaming source with good quality sound. It's good for reading, clear and the right size screen. With wifi you should be able to skype or zoom just fine, but be aware of the camera set up. The screen size is great without becoming unmanageable. Much larger would be too much, but 10.1"" is what I had before and that worked for me as well.The camera for the front (facing the same way the screen is) has been set on the lengthwise edge. So if you'r going to set this up for video chats, you will need to keep the long side up.The usb port is USB Type C, which is a different plug than what you may be used to if you've been using a Type Micro-B (very common on cell phones and desk tops now.) Be careful you are getting the cabling you anticipate. Also the cable for charging is very short. Don't expect to both charge and use the tablet at the same time much.Important to note, if you're expecting to add a micro-SD card to increase storage, you will find there is no slot for that. Should that be your intent, look at another tablet. As it happens, 128G is more than adequate for my needs, I suspect 64G would be pushing my luck. I've been using a tablet with 16G internal storage and a micro-SD flash drive but found there are a lot of things Android will not let you store off to the flash drive. The large internal storage will alleviate that issue for me, but consider if this is what YOU want.I struggled doing the transfer between my old tablet and the new one, but this turned out to be because the new one needed to update the data moving tool a few times to match what I downloaded to my old tablet. Go figure. Once connected it went smoothly.",291 people found this helpful

The first couple days of using it myself had proven to be about on par as to what those reviews said. Then quickly the issues began piling on.Constant app crashing, frame drops on the home screen after waking it up after a whole night, input delays and lots of setting features I couldn't find that are accessible on most other android devices.One of the biggest gripes I had that I just could not find a fix to was it's nature to just randomly kill off any bluetooth devices connected to it. It would refuse to reconnect anything until I either waited an indefinite amount of time or restarted the entire tablet. But it would just kill the bluetooth again when it felt like throwing a tantrum, and Samsung forums were not very helpful, especially when most of the solutions involved going into settings menus that don't exist on this tablet.It has a bit of a chug starting up most games but would handle decently during gameplay for the most part. Though a lot of 3D games ended up putting a struggle on the frames even on low settings.The cameras are fine and work well for video calling and any spur of the moment photo taking you may have and from what I've been told by people I called, the mic isn't half bad.Battery life is surprisingly good and lasts me at least a few days.However, I my plans to use this tablet for internet scrolling, light gaming and messaging just cannot be done on a consistent level with the unpredictable bluetooth disconnections, constant lag and overall performance issues.

Maybe. Would I be happy with it? No. I'm back to using my old one. I should have returned this one immediately rather than try to get used to it. Since it's past the return date, I'll probably just donate it somewhere. I am VERY disappointed with Samsung.",

Bad move because I would soon find out that the tablet will not recognize ANY sd card I put in it. Googling it shows it to be a very common problem that apparently Samsung doesn't want to address. Tried all of Samsung's fixes, in fact tried all fixes I could find, to no avail. With just my basic stuff on it, the internal storage is 80% full. Since I can't return the tablet, I figured I'd try to make the best of it, except when I tried to configure the back-up of my stuff to an external device (I don't trust clouds), the tablet doesn't recognize my external storage. Googling it shows it to be just another common problem that Samsung doesn't want to address.

Unfortunately, Samsung clearly doesn't care about their tablets they way they care about their phones.Can't get email through Exchange Online working. Setting it up on my phone was a snap.No Samsung email client to keep my work email out of Gmails clutches... but that doesn't matter since email won't configure.Can't use any themes. The Galaxy store is worthless on this device. There are no themes available. You can purchase icon packs, but they are not compatible and you can't get a refund.The only reason I got this over an iPad was SDCard support.Oh well, back to giving Microsoft my money.",

Its exterior, thickness and weight, along with the very slim bezels, made it feel like a premium device. The size of the screen is great for watching movies, and its Dolby Atmos support got me excited. Buttons felt solid, too, with the right amount of click.Upon booting and setting it up, the UI felt smooth... most of the time. There was occasional slowdown when flipping through screens. The pixels making up the app icons were very noticeable, and sometimes text in YouTube and Disney+ looked pixelated.I did not intend the Tab A8 to be a gaming or working device. I just wanted to buy and download movies to watch offline. Seemingly a simple thing for a 2022 device to do without issues. For some reason, Disney+ would crash often, and struggle to play any shows. Downloading movies was a chore (yes, I set them to download to the SD card) and after all was done, they wouldn't play. Oh well, I could still get movies on YouTube NOPE. Movies would download, but would not load when going offline.All of this, on top of performance gradually becoming slower. Even after uninstalling most apps and leaving only the streaming ones, apps would often crash. Rebooting only mitigated the issue for a bit.Why do manufacturers think that 2-3GB of RAM are good enough for modern devices? The OS alone, freshly booted with no apps opened, ate up 2.1 of the 2.6GB of available memory. I just wanted to watch movies. Yes, I know there's a version of the A8 with 4GB of RAM. My point being, the 3GB version should not exist.It really was a heartbreaking experience. I wasn't asking for too much and the Tab A8 still managed to underdeliver.",3 people found this helpful

One issue I found so far that bothers me is that the Wifi, after a day or so, won't connect, and the only way for it to connect was to restart the device. At this point, I'm not sure if it is a hardware or software issue. Will have to experiment with this over the next few days to know. There are plenty reviews already out on the Internet; look for those if you want details. I purchased this pretty much for web browsing, video watching, and home monitoring, so nothing that requires high performance. My expectations are low to start with, so I'm ok with the device, as long as everything functions (like the Wifi).Update: I found a software bug with this device: If you have auto-restart turned ON, every time an auto-start happens, the WIFI will NOT connect, and you'll have to do a manual restart for the WIFI to work again. It's a shame that the mechanism to fix intermittent or unknown problems is causing problems.",11 people found this helpful

While I was playing a game today the game closed suddenly.  This is the 2nd time in 24 hours. There is no support if you buy your tablet from Amazon.

However, after a few months I've decided I'm disappointed. First, I just recently tried to pair two different sets and brands of bluetooth earbuds. In both cases I experienced the same issue: sound only came through one earbud and somewhat erratically, not always the same side. The earbuds work fine when paired with other devices (like my old Fire or a laptop), so it's not the earbuds. In any case I tried all the troubleshooting, repairing, etc. recommended for the earbuds. So there is something off in the bluetooth audio function in the tablet. Secondly, I regularly get a reading of less than 100% charge (something in the 90s) after many hours of charging. Checking on this issue, I did a complete battery drain to ""reset"" the meter, but after a couple charges it went back to not reaching 100% again. I also miss from the Fire a simple bluescreen filter toggle for reading before bed. The Samsung has a night brightness reduction but with set times which can't even be changed. There don't seem to be a lot of quality tablet options in this price range, so I'm really sad this hasn't worked out so well. The Fire did better in all the areas mentioned here for far less money. I would buy a new Fire if its Android implementation wasn't hamstrung. So I guess I'm stuck.",One person found this helpful

After about a month of ownership, I turned on the tablet to find that Android 12 had to be installed to further use the product. After installation of Android 12, the tablet developed a strange problem. When I turned it on after off for the night, there was no sound. I restarted the tablet and was relieved to find the sound returned. Each time off for the night, next day no sound. It always required a time consuming restart. I finally contacted Samsung support. After two techs and a lot of time to try and resolve the problem, NO improvement. By this time I had spent at least six hours wasted with NO improvement. Finally Samsung said to mail it to New Jersey for repair. Today they emailed me my tablet is to be returned unrepaired. The Samsung representative claims the tablet had been damaged by water which voids the warranty. TOTAL BS.

I am still waiting on a unlock method so I can root it but otherwise I am unsure if I would recommend this tablet as it feels outdated esp compared to the A7 tablet which is almost identical (LESS RAM). Also this tablet has an atrocious time connecting via bluetooth. I cannot connect my phone to my tablet and they are both Samsung supported products.

My phone and all other wifi devices have excellent signal anywhere in the house, even outside. Not this trash though.How does this have such good reviews when my very much older device is 100 times better at the only thing that matters?Total waste of money.*UPDATE*After about 7 months of use I would like to update my original review by asking Amazon for something lower than 1 star. Zero stars? Negative stars?In addition to the abysmal wi-fi reception, it also seems that the battery life of this thing is also unacceptably horrible. In a turned off state the unit will lose about 25% battery life per day. That's right, TURNED OFF it loses battery life at an amazing rate. You would have to keep it permanently connected to power to be able to use it daily. I find myself using it less and less.

Also tried my Samsung phone charger in case the charger that came with the tablet was defective, and that made no difference.My order says this item is eligible for a refund or replacement, but product support told me that I can't have a replacement. They said they only have an option for a refund of the Prime Day price and I would have to purchase a new tablet at the current price. The rep then offered to send me to another department that could refund the current tablet price. That department never answered after almost 15 minutes. The product support rep then said she'd send them an email and I should expect a call from that department within 24 hours.Literally two minutes after the call ended, I received an email that says Amazon doesn't price match and they hope this resolved my question. Nope, not at all. I'll call back to get a refund, but this is definitely not a deal if I have to send it back and spend more money elsewhere for a tablet to go with the SD card and case that I also bought through Amazon on Prime Day.

At first I thought I must be touching the navigation buttons but I was able to rule that out because the problem occurred even when the tablet was laying flat on the table with nothing even close to the navigation buttons. I couldn't even set up my email initially it happened so often. I contacted Amazon customer support, and they had me try all the things I had already tried to no avail. But at least it began to happen less frequently. I should have returned it the first day, but the problem became more intermittent. It still happened multiple times every single time I used it, but less often so I was able to complete tasks. Nobody wants to return a device they've put all their personal information on, so I continued to be patient. One month in, and I took it off the charger one morning, checked the weather without issues, and 5 minutes later it was just a brick. Completely unresponsive. I tried a factory reset from the off position without luck. Ruled out charger issues. Thankfully Amazon refunded my money and took it back. I am sure every tablet isn't as defective as the one I was sent, but that is the one I am reviewing. I declined having them send me another of the same tablet, and I bought a Lenovo instead.",14 people found this helpful

The boxes appeared normal but upon opening them it was clear something was not right with the product itself. The tablets included an adapter plug (a bent one at that) to allow you to plug into US outlets. It was clearly made for another part of the world. This was further proven when the welcome prompts didn't even include the US as a country of residence to choose from. I tried to return these and Amazon still hasn't refunded me for one of them. I've spent hours of my life on hold, being tossed around, and then finally told to call back later. I have never been disappointed in Amazon until now.

Switched from an old iPad because Apple's billing kept cancelling the subscription.  The A8 is noticeably slower driving the UI, paring bluetooth devices and generally doing everything.  But it runs the Zwift app with its 3D rendering just fine. And that was all I wanted until I tried to run Skoove (piano lessons), and the app just crashes constantly.  Skoove runs fine on my Pixel phone, and while these things are hard to diagnose for sure, the symptoms suggest that the device is either fundamentally unreliable, or unsuitable for a ""real"" app.  I've also found that the idle battery life is only about two days, which is pretty bad considering I have almost nothing installed.Spend more money and buy something better!",

It keeps crashing on me when I'm trying to load some apps again, then it's a hustle to get it back since there are no buttons and the screen freeze. It's very slow...I mean even rotating the screen on its side takes 3 seconds until something happens. The battery drains super fast and takes forever to charge it. Overall doesn't worth it even for the low price. I'm surprised Samsung released that product since users won't buy the better model after a nightmare experience with the basic model...Most important warning - the 32GB internal storage is already loaded with unerasable apps and software that takes 15GB already. The tablet keeps updating and that storage runout even if you don't touch the tablet. So that's a bit deceiving on their part to advertise that as 32GB for the user use...I bought a 256 GB SD card added to it.

"SAMSUNG Galaxy Tab A8 10.5‚Äù 32GB Android Tablet w/ LCD Screen, Long Lasting Battery, Kids Content, Smart Switch, Expandable Memory, US Version, Silver, Amazon Exclusive",5.0,A better tablet than what I was looking for,"Reviewed in the United States on March 24, 2023",Color: Pink Gold | Size: 32GB,False,"I've been looking at getting a new inexpensive 10"" tablet for awhile now. Didn't need anything special as I was just planning on using it to replace an old HP Touchpad (WebOS) tablet that I've been using as a dedicated tablet for some PDF technical manuals & books - along with photos and videos. The HP tablet has lasted many a year - but it was starting to fall apart and the battery had developed issues.This Samsung tablet looked interesting - and it was on sale - for a little more than any of the cheap no-name tablets I had been considering. I have had a Samsung Tab tablet before - years ago - and it was a decent tablet. So I knew this one would be of fairly good quality - with the cheaper tablets I had no clue what I might get.The tablet is nice - very thin - but surprising heavy. I like that I can add a micro SD memory card to it - which I will be doing to simplify the storage of the material that I want to use on the tablet.Setting up this new tablet took some time. Right out of the box it needed to be updated - and most of the apps needed updating. So I had to connect it to the internet, and log into my Google account to do some of that. Then I had to set up a Samsung account to update those apps. Which was easy to do as you can use your Google account to create the Samsung account. There is some two-step verification that has to be done - so you do have to use your cell phone number to get the code. The process was a bit more involved than I would have liked - but that is pretty much how most things work these days. You also have to deal with setting a ton of permissions - most of which I turned Off.Once I got everything updated, I played with the tablet for a bit. I was surprised to see some Microsoft apps on it - and it has the option of using OneDrive (which I refuse to do). I'll probably uninstall those apps.Really all I needed was a basic android tablet - that could play videos, view photos, and open PDFs. This tablet is capable of much more than that. I'm more than happy with my purchase.",

"SAMSUNG Galaxy Tab A8 10.5‚Äù 32GB Android Tablet w/ LCD Screen, Long Lasting Battery, Kids Content, Smart Switch, Expandable Memory, US Version, Silver, Amazon Exclusive",5.0,Excellent all round tablet,"Reviewed in the United States on August 8, 2022",Color: Dark Gray | Size: 32GB,False,"I currently have a Samsung Galaxy Tab A T580 (2016) and an iPad 9th gen (2016) the later of which is being used by my wife. Being 6 years old, my other tablets were becoming a bit slow although resetting the T580 to factory defaults and then reinstalling the apps significantly sped up this older tablet. I primarily use the tablet to watch videos (Netflix, Pluto, etc.) and do research via a browser. Although I didn't really need a new tablet, special circumstances enabled me to get this tablet new for < $180 (sales tax holiday also) which was a deal that I couldn't pass up.Keep in mind that whenever you switch to a new device there will be subtle differences that will take some time to get used to.The picture on this tablet is excellent with good color rendition. The color tone is a little less warm (less reddish) than the iPad or T580 but is excellent and now that I have gotten used to it, I prefer the color rendition on this tablet.  If after you load the tablet and don't like the color or picture, I'd suggest going to settings/display and then;1) Turn brightness up to just a little to the left of the red part of the line2) Turn adaptive brightness off3) Turn eye comfort shield off. Note that if you tap the text ""Eye Comfort Shield"" you are taken to a 2nd screen where you can adjust the color temperature. Like the color temp in a light bulb it will change the color tone from more white to yellowish.Unlike the iPad and T580, this tablet does not have a physical home button which took me a couple of hours to get used to. Although I would prefer a physical home button the soft button (swipe up a little and then select the rectangle) works fine.I should note that I used the data transfer tool to copy all of my data, settings and apps from the T580 to the new tablet. There were a few minor issues but the transfer completed. However, the color on the Tab A was off - a bit to the yellow, white skin was gray, shadows had a green/yellow tint, no true white and I couldn't find a setting to correct this. At first I assumed there was a defect in the tablet. However, I reset to factory defaults and then manually reloaded and now everything is fine.I think that the wallpaper options on this tablet are terrible. You can install an app that can be used to download other wallpapers but who wants another app. I just went outside and took a pic of the blue sky with clouds and use this as my wallpaper which I really like.Older Android versions had some options that are missing from this tablet that I miss such as the ability to make the app icons larger and 'icons with frames'.When doing a fresh install versus transferring data from an old device it gives you the option to not install some apps which saves time from having to find & delete later.Note that this tablet uses a USB-C connector on the tablet side which is the newest standard but uses the standard USB A rectangular connector on the charger side. Like me, your home charging station is probably becoming more crowded with a Micro USB, USB-C, Fitbit and lightning cables. You can buy adapters on eBay for a buck or 2 if you want to reduce the number of cables.I am not an anti-Apple person. I use an iPhone 13 but find the iPads to be too expensive and the user interface to be clunky and difficult to use compared to the Android tablet options.",2 people found this helpful

We have 5 other tablets.  All Samsung.  It connects to everything just fine including a Logitech k480 keyboard which is like a fully blown keyboard and size.  I have taken it way out in the yard and across the street and it pulls in the Wi-Fi just fine.  I read all the bad reviews and I think that 90% of them are user are.  It expands just fine on You tube but if you have slow wi-fi it might not have strong enough signal to expand.  I have Samsung TV's in every room in the house.  I am on an Antenna and get over 90 channels.  The farther down the line I get a weak signal and I had to put a booster on the line.  I have had the TV's and tablet go black but that is a bug not to product.  I have gotten around it all and no longer have the problem.  I leave the A8 on the kitchen table and we can use it at breakfast all week on one charge.  The battery is just fine.  It depends on how bright you have it set and how long a time on the automatic turn off set.  It has 4 speakers.  It has more, base than I like and when watching something on You Tube the sound can sound like it is coming from a tin can at times.  I like the sound of my Samsung s6 lite much better.  I have good hearing even though I am in my 70's.  I got it on a fantastic sale form Costco.  I bought my s6 light for $249.99 when someone on Amazon had a good sale and I use some of my reward points.  The A8 is a good tablet.  The 7 has better reviews but cost more.  It is a very good tablet for the money.  I have a lot of grand and great grandchildren and I have bought many brands of tablets.  Amazon Fire tablets were on a half price sale two years ago.  They turned out to be great.  For $80 they were an out of the park homerun.  I suggest if you are having problems return it for a new one or refund.  If you go over the time to return It is your fault.  No one makes a perfect product that works out of the box all the time.  Don't write a bad review if you are a dumb schmuck that can't make it work.  Check your settings and learn how to use it.  I am old and have no problem at all.  I just like Samsung products except for the Kitchen appliances.  They are over price and break down.  That is another story for another review.  NO I don't own any",

"SAMSUNG Galaxy Tab A8 10.5‚Äù 32GB Android Tablet w/ LCD Screen, Long Lasting Battery, Kids Content, Smart Switch, Expandable Memory, US Version, Silver, Amazon Exclusive",5.0,Great Product For Cost,"Reviewed in the United States üá∫üá∏ on August 22, 2022",Color: Silver | Size: 32GB,False,"NOTE: THIS IS FOR THE 64GB MODEL WHICH HAS MORE RAM/MEMORY THAN THE 32GB VERSION.I do NOT recommend the 32GB version, as any buffering/stutter that DOES occur is fine on the 64GB model, but WILL be an issue on the 32GB model.---To be clear, this tablet is a great value if you're looking for a tablet that feels premium, but on a budget.  One review states 'Best value for a tablet' and this is BS.  You can 100% get better value, but you may not have a screen that's as high quality, or a battery that lasts as long.BATTERY:On idle, the tablet lasts about 5-days, but using the tablet will drain faster (obviously).  I state idle time for those who like to keep the tablet on for periods of time unplugged (like myself) as letting it drain to 0% is very bad for the battery.  I watch maybe 30mins of videos at a time and it'll drain around 5-10% at mid brightness.  With prolonged use, that may decrease as extended use can generate heat and increase drain.  However, for my use I didn't notice any significant heat like on cheaper tablets.  USB-C is also used for charging, so this is great news for compatibility.SCREEN:Screen looks amazing for the price.  You may find better, but for less than $300 this is the one to pick up.  You get a 10.5in screen which is massive, and looks absolutely gorgeous.  I don't use a screen protector for mine, but do have a flip case to protect the screen between uses.SPEED:Overall the tablet seems perfect when watching YT/Crunchyroll streams.  I don't game on this tablet so can't speak on them.  For videos and general use, this device is perfect.  It did stutter one time and go black for a few seconds, but it was a bit of an anomaly that I didn't notice after.  The device will have a slight response time for some actions, but overall apps load reasonably and all videos buffer ahead as you'd hope.SOUND:Overall sound is good.  You will hear words clearly enough.  It's a basic speaker.  You won't be impressed, but you also won't be insulted (some of the cheaper tablets are so tinny, you can't even make out words!).  It does have a 3.5 AUX audio cable for wired sound devices, as well as BT capability.  I use BT without noticeable latency so that's nice!  Really it's got the basics you'll need and then some.CHARGING:First note, as above, is the tablet is USB-C.  This is great as all newer devices worth buying use USB-C (get on board iPhone!).  However this warranted it's own category as the charger/brick it comes with are not the best.  It is a standard charger that works fine for the device, and does standard charge rates.  However, I found using my Super Fast Charging cable/brick that came with my phone charged this tablet at 2x the speed (fast charging rates).The standard charger was reported by the tablet itself as 'Charging' speeds.  Ampere reported a charging rate of 1220mA - 1250mA.The super fast charger was reported by the tablet itself as 'Fast Charging' speeds (limit of the tablet).  Ampere reported a charging rate of 2540mA - 2560mA which is double the rate.The drain while running these reports WITHOUT charging was -460mA at approximately 1/3rd of the screen brightness.Also note the super fast charger (which charged at fast charging rates) did not heat up as much.  The standard charger that came with the tablet got fairly warm, but not uncomfortable hot.  It does the job just not as well.What this should tell you is that while the device can charge fine with the standard charger, you can upgrade to a Fast Charging capable charger for faster charging rates.  Note faster charging will cause the tablet to heat up more esp if charging while in use!  Faster charging can also reduce the life span of a tablet's battery capacity over time (over use of several years).  If being able to charge faster is important, I'd recommend a fast charger by a reputable brand such as Anker (there are plenty of others, so shop around and see which one you like most, just making sure it supports Fast Charging).OVERALL:In general it's a great tablet.  Like I stated it opens apps quickly enough and overall quality is there.  A $500+ tablet by Samsung, for example, will have overall better sound quality and performance.  However, $250-$300 on this tablet will get you a lot of performance with the Samsung quality you'd expect.  I also feel that while a $500-$800 tablet WILL be much better for gaming or prolonged use, it won't 'blow it out of the water.'  This device may not have the premium sound quality or instant feedback of a higher priced tablet, but it works VERY well for much less.  It's a very good intro into the high end line of Samsung tablets, AND a full 10.5in screen which is perfect for browsing or watching videos/streams.",3 people found this helpful

It's a 3 star for sure and should probably be in the $100 range.,"Reviewed in the United States üá∫üá∏ on August 23, 2022",Color: Dark Gray | Size: 64GB,False,"I got this tablet on prime day because I wanted one for years. I wasn't expecting much and have tons of experience with both Android and Samsung. That said, it's just gotta be different... why... I will be honest, even though I wasn't expecting much, I still feel this tablet is not worth the cost and quite frankly, feels dated and old right out of the box.Start-up went about as expect. Although, no charger included. Rude! Seriously though... what is with these guys not giving us chargers? It's been going on for so long at this point I am actually running out of options for cables and chargers. Trying to find ones compatible with each device is a pain in the ass. Does is super fast charge? Is it USB-C? Etc etc... Just give us a damn charger and cable.The tablet didn't want to connect to my S21 Ultra or my Pixel 3a XL to gather app data and account information. Finally forced it through direct connection after multiple restarts of both devices. No idea what caused the hiccup... it just kinda started working. Nothing was changed when it decided to work. You enable a couple options on both devices, sit back and let it do it's thing. 3rd time it decided to cooperate.Next issue was how slow it is. I chalked this up in the beginning to updates and such, but nope... still slow. I've cleared everything, removed unnecessary apps, optimized battery and background usage etc etc... This thing feels like a dated iPad from 2012. It's very unresponsive and laggy. It doesn't matter how much storage you have left, it's due to the small amount of RAM and slow CPU. My worst fears were a slow tablet because of these things.The final issue I have is the screen itself. The image quality to be more accurate. It's VERY blue. There is no ""night"" option like in literally every other device I have ever owned. Or as Samsung calls it, something along the lines of ""eye care"". No option for color tones at all on this device. Even after forced updates.SO, overall I believe it's a subpar tablet that Samsung just threw together with parts they had laying around to milk the most of excess junk they had - quite frankly. It should be in the $100 range, no more than $130. There is nothing $200+ about this tablet. If it was that price range, it would still be MAYBE a 3.5-4 star review.",

Long-time Android phone user - but never impressed by the tablets.  I have been using iPads for years because they are so well designed and have such a great screen - but this is a game-changer.  Paired with my Galaxy S21 - this is fantastic.  Cross-device sharing of files and apps - beautiful screen - incredibly fast - no lag on anything.  The pen is delightful to use but hard to keep up with. (one of the only negatives).  The size is also perfect - I think any other size would have been too large for my use case - I would just use a laptop for anything larger - but this is perfect for working on the go or surfing the web on the couch.  DEX mode is really cool too.I have the Samsung keyboard and it is pretty nice - I think it could benefit from lit keys - and I occasionally have a few keys that do not register when I type - but that may still be me learning how to type on a mini keyboard.  The KB has a great place to store the pen - which is nice.  OH - also having the fingerprint reader on the power button is another great feature!!!,2 people found this helpful

It tends to lose wireless connection periodically, claiming the wireless network does not have Internet connectivity (and you cannot switch this check off in modern Android). Of course, there is Internet connectivity, and no other devices in my home lose connection at the same time. Also after just a few months of use, it started disconnecting Bluetooth devices after 10-20 minutes of use, and never connects them back (and cannot discover any new devices) until fully restarted.

I was very disappointed when I started to set up my new tablet.  The On/Off switch will turn the tablet On, but won't put it in sleep mode or turn it Off.  To turn the tablet Off you need to pull down a menu or go to settings, so if your tablet ever ""locks up"" you can't reset it by turning it off.  I guess the only way to reset the tablet would be to let the battery run out and then recharge it so you could restart the tablet.  So it would go from a simple button ""push and hold"" to a several hour operation.  Also there was no way to ""reprogram"" the start button in the settings menu.  My next issue was with the volume buttons.  The up volume button worked but the down volume button wouldn't decrease the volume.  To decrease the volume you had to push the up volume button to bring up a volume control on the screen and then quickly decrease the volume with a slide control on the screen.  With the 2018 version of the 8a you could go into settings and reprogram the volume buttons to act normally,  but that settings option was removed in the 2022 version.My next issue was with picture quality.  I like bright vivid colors and the colors looked washed out.  Easy fix, just adjust the brightness and contrast control right.  Nope, there was a brightness control, but no contrast control in the settings.  There isn't even independent controls for setting the Red, Green, and Blue scales.  There was nothing I could do to adjust the contrast and color to my satisfaction.I saw so disappointed in the overall operation of the tablet that I reset it to the original factory settings and returned it.",2 people found this helpful

I upgraded from a Galaxy Tab S5e to a Galaxy Tab S8 Ultra.  The problem was, I used the Galaxy Tab S5e on a nightstand mount for a clock, some audiobooks, Kindle, music, and an alarm clock.  So, having upgraded to a huge tablet (and I love it) I needed something to fill the gap left by the smaller Galaxy Tab S5e.  I bought this Galaxy Tab A8 10.5-inch tablet.  What a mistake!Let's just dive into what's good: The price is ok and the feel of this tablet indicates a great build quality.  It'll receive up to Android 15, but I would bet it'd get even slower. That's where the ""good"" ends.Samsung discontinues support for tablets due to advances in technology.  The problem is, that this tablet is several steps backward in functionality and speed from older devices like the Galaxy Tab S5e.As an example, resetting the A8 for return took over 15 minutes to reset.  A typical reboot was between five and ten minutes!  The Galaxy Tab S5e was a budget ""premium"" tablet, so not top shelf, but definitely not the bottom.  The Galaxy Tab A8 is a bottom shelf in all but ""feel"".  10GB of the storage is used by the OS, which supposedly leaves 22GB for apps and data.  Even with a 512GB micro SD card, I was getting errors or running out of space and that was copied from a 32GB tablet with a 512GB micro SD to another.  Lame.At night, with a completely black screen, the light bleed was so bad it would illuminate my room to an annoying level, and that was with the brightness as low as it would go.  The color quality is atrocious. I'm the type that schedules the eye care to turn on limiting blue light, which adds a yellow tint.  This A8 turned orange.  Regardless of the strength of the blue light filter, everything that should be white (with a yellow hue) was orange.I'm at the point where I'm going to just eat the $200 trade-in for the S5e and keep it rather than keeping the A8.  I really don't think this would placate a child that has no expectations of performance; yes, it's that bad.I do not recommend this product.

This has proven to be true. All of my past and present Android devices were from Motorola, Lenovo and Google. There was an immediate, comfortable familiarity and similarity between how those devices functioned, etc.Now I'm learning the Samsung way and it's been quite new and different. Not bad at all just different in it's style and format.Anyway, now to the A8 specifically. I am not now and never have been a power user. So, the A8 is more than adequate for my needs. After much fiddling and trial and error (the new Samsung way, remember) and countless trips to settings I tailored the A8 to my liking and it is quite nice. The stock wallpapers are lame so I imported Google wallpaper. And I installed Gboard because it's an old, trusted friend.Initially I was NOT happy with battery life/time. I have since discovered that the battery is ""learning"" my usage habits. etc., and it is now performing as advertised. Maybe better. There are a number of maintenance and care functions in settings. The auto sleep function of my case cover helps too.",43 people found this helpful

The A8 (2021) with 128GB of storage has a good screen, substantial construction, plenty of memory (which will make it usable long after the OS is obsolete) and adequate performance.  The Samsung interface built on top of Android is pretty good.  Bloatware isn't extensive.  I especially like the ability to split the screen and use 2 apps at the same time.  I also like the ability to mirror the screen and sound to a smart TV or Roku.  The only thing missing in my opinion is a touch sensor to unlock the device; logging in is such a drag and Android's (not Samsung's) Smart Lock is unreliable at times.  Sound using the built-in speakers is pleasant. Headphone sound using the wired jack is OK but not outstanding.  Can't report on Bluetooth audio.  Samsung is slow to roll out Android upgrades but they eventually do appear.  A great value in my opinion.",18 people found this helpful

If you're looking for a tablet which will allow you to do serious work or high-end gaming, you're probably better off looking at those. However, if you're looking for something for entertainment (streaming, reading ebooks, light gaming, checking social media and e-mail) then this device is perfectly capable. It can do just about everything a mid-range phone can do.I personally went with the 128 gb/4 gb RAM. I'd recommend getting the 64 gb or 128 gb for the 4 gb RAM. The 32 gb model only has 3 gb RAM. If you expect to occasionally do some multitasking or otherwise tend to leave apps open or running in the background, that extra gig of RAM should help things run more smoothly. You can expand the storage by using a microSD card but be aware that not all apps are designed to be run that way. I'd still recommend getting enough storage for at least most of the apps you use regularly. SD storage is better used for downloads, pictures, etc.In terms of performance, this tablet can run your day-to-day tasks smoothly. I've tried a few streaming services and they've all run as fine as they do on my other devices (or at least as well as the device is designed to handle).The LCD screen isn't as impressive as some of Samsung's AMOLED screens, but the picture quality is still quite good for a budget device. It's full HD. I'm sure some people will disagree, but I personally don't think you need more than that for a 10-inch screen.If you already have Samsung devices, they can work together. I have my Tab connected with my phone. I can get messages and even calls while I'm on my tablet.I saw another review posted that said they couldn't figure out how to take screenshots. For people not familiar with Samsung devices: You press the power button and the volume down button at the same time. It'll take the shot immediately. It's a bit more awkward on the tablet than it is on my phone because of the positioning of the buttons, but I believe it works the same on all Samsung phones/tablets.Also, as of this post, it will try to update to Android 13 (Samsung One UI 5.0) right out of the box, so plan to give it some time to set up.Overall, it's just a very solid and capable budget tablet and I'm quite happy with it.",

Since I'm a daily ""basic stuff"" user (internet surfing, movies/streaming, music, social media, emails, news, etc), I really didn't want to pay more than I actually needed to.I've been using this tablet for a couple of weeks and am very happy!I purchased the 4gb/64gb and it performs smoothly opening/closing multiple apps, scrolling, video playback, internet browsing, etc. No stuttering or lag.The picture quality for movie watching & streaming is enjoyable! Smooth and clear! Some have complained that the coloring is on the cool side (VS warm side).  I agree... When I compared my old tablet to this one side by side, the cool tone does make some (not all) content appear less vivid. Again, not a deal breaker for the pricing... and certainly not bad that it distracts or ruins the viewing experience.The sound quality is crisp and clear. I love the surround sound vibe that the 4 speakers provide (2 on each side). Nice extra that they still kept the headphone jack on the this model.***Fyi... Make a note to verify Dolby Atmos setting is turned on (goto settings, sound, sound quality effects). Mine was off and I was wondering why the sound was so low at first.The battery holds the charge very well for my pattern of daily usage. Included in the box is a 7.75watt adapter that has a USB-C port... and also a USB C to USB C cable (it takes about 6hrs to get full charge when drained).The tablet is capable of up to 15 watt fast charging (about 3hrs to get a full charge when drained). You will need to purchase a 15 watt charger separately if you want ""fast charging"" in your future.***In settings, you have the option to turn on/off ""fast charging"". Make sure that option is on when you need to utilize it.The design feels nice... Slim and lightweight. Comfortable to hold in both hands. Yet also has a sturdy/supportive feel due to the metal backing. I use a case on mine, which makes all of that moot though. I also add a screen protector (which didn't affect the accuracy of the touch screen capability).I'd definitely recommend if you are looking for an all-around good/solid tablet that doesn't break the bank!I did have a serious issue at first with this tablet:There is a small minority of reviews that say the wifi drops out or gets a weak signal or a fluctuating signal. Unfortunately I did experience this. Altho it worked fine when I was in the area of my wifi router, the signal was extremely weak (buffering/slow loading) when I'd go to the far end of the house. I never had a wifi signal problem at far end of the house prior. A few said they returned the tablet, but then reported that the replacement did the same thing... So maybe this tablet doesn't play well with particular routers or has issues with interference, since only a very small minority reported the problem. What to do?Since I really liked this tablet and didn't want the hassle of finding another model or brand...I noticed a review posted by B. Maschal on September 14, 2022 who said he bought the Tab A8 and experienced same issue. He said he bought a wifi extender which solved the problem. I don't even know what a wifi extender is... Lol. So...I took a chance and purchased a random $25 wifi extender on Amazon (TP-Link AC750 WiFi Extender RE220)... and that solved the issue for me!Update 1/29/2023: have been using daily for 3 months and haven't had any issues. Also no complications when it updated to Android 13. Very happy with this tablet!",309 people found this helpful

It didn't, but that's ok now. The protective cases that I ordered separately to go with these tablets had arrived so I wrapped those up and printed a screenshot of the order so they would know what they were going to get. My elderly parents were using cheap $40 or cheaper no name brand tablets for years and then wonder why they can't play the things they want on them or why they didn't last. They absolutely love these tablets.  I did have to help my parents set the tablets up, I'm sure they would have figured it out on their own as it's pretty straight forward and simple, but they have no patience and refused to do it. It does have Smartswitch to help transfer files and apps from the old tablet, but if the old tablets are outdated, such as theirs, it's not an option unless you want to pay for another knockoff smartswitch app from the Google play store to do that, I refused to pay for something I wasn't sure was going to work lol. So I downloaded all their apps manually, which was very fast. The display is amazing, the size is perfect for my parents.  Now they've only had this a few days now, but they've had no issues which for my parents is a miracle in itself lol. They watch videos and play tons of fb games with no lagging issues or technical issues. They are so happy with these tablets  Now waiting for this to be shipped was agonizingly slow in this day and age and the delivery date was even pushed back some after I had ordered which almost made me reconsider requesting a refund, but once it does actually ship it's very fast. Very happy with purchase",3 people found this helpful

Also, it does not have alot of Bloatware on it, what it did have I was able to remove. Screen is nice and bright, and adjustable for brightness. Battery could be better, longer lasting, but I have a USB Power Bank I can plug into it and power for days. There are reviews of this that its not perfect that its low end and budget friendly, and maybe it is, but I like it and use it. For a week in August I used it every day when I was manning a booth at the local county fair. Not only did I watch lots of video's, but did my YouTubing, and I had no issues, except the on screen keyboard, but I am legally blind. So I will bet a Bluetooth keyboard for it.

My husband got it for me for Christmas this year, I just love it. He originally got me the A7 but promptly exchanged it for this one as he thought this was the better of the 2. I was happy with the A7 but when I got this one and started to play my HP game and saw the difference, it was crazy. This one (A8) runs so much smoother and faster, it's just crazy. I did kinda like the smaller size of the A7 but this one definitely is the clear winner for me. I can't wait to begin shopping on Amazon with it too! I only play games, shop, and watch videos/movies on it and it's perfect for all of them. Once you set it up, sign in to your accounts, it literally does the rest for you. Connects to my phone with absolutely no issues whatsoever. I just LOVE this tablet!!",

It was a gift, so I couldn't choose.  An Apple ipad2.  In 10 years' time, I managed to continue using it (WIFI only) with compounding levels of frustration.  When Apple ceased use of the @me.com email server and the Apple rep told me (at year 5) that I needed to buy a new iPad because my old one was ""obsolete,"" I vowed never to buy into the hype that is Apple, never.  Surprisingly, a year ago, the @me.com email server started working again.  So much for the ""genius"" being so smart.  Comparing the A8 to a 10-year-old ipad is probably unfair, but when you consider the entry level price VS that of a new ipad,  I am convinced of Apple's false sense of superiority.  I did consider purchasing a Tab S8, but when I got right down to it, I am not streaming movies or performing amazing feats of graphic design on a tablet, EVER! So why do I need it?  Truth told, the A8 will stream, but that is not my purpose for it. I use it to read the morning paper or quickly check email when I don't want to walk to the home office on the other side of the house or to share content on FB with a guest.  Considering the short term support these devices offer, why should I spend 5, 6 or 700 dollars to do the simple tasks the A8 handles with ease.  I am totally happy with my purchase of the A8 and suggest it is indeed a sound replacement to an aged tablet.",48 people found this helpful
