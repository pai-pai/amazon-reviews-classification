"Introducing Kindle Scribe (16 GB), the first Kindle for reading and writing, with a 10.2‚Äù 300 ppi Paperwhite display, includes Basic Pen",4.0,"Great Reader, Good Writer - It's a First Generation Device","Reviewed in the United States üá∫üá∏ on January 2, 2023",Option: Premium Pen | Setup: 64 GB | Offer Type: Without Kindle Unlimited,True,"I have been looking at e-ink writing-enabled devices since the Remarkable 1 came out and could never justify anything more expensive than the Mobiscribe.  When the Scribe was announced, I pre-ordered it, canceled my order and then bought it anyway.  I'm so glad I did!  So why did I almost not buy it?  I'm a software developer by trade as well as a voracious reader and journaler, and let's face it; any first-generation device is going to have bugs.  That's just the way of it.  Overall, I am very pleased with the Scribe and use it for hours every day.  It has replaced paper planners and journals.  The only thing that keeps it from replacing my other Kindles as a reader is that it's a bit big.  However, the size is great for writing, so I'm not complaining.Let's look at it as an e-reader.  It's great.  It's a Kindle.  Amazon has had years to perfect the e-ink reading experience and I expected no less.  Because I read far more PDF's on this device than I did on earlier Kindles,  I have noticed that there seems to be an inconsistency in navigation with PDF's and, more importantly, the writing experience with them.  I address this later in the review.So, the Scribe as an e-writer: it's quite good!  Not perfect, but very good.  Let's look at the three main ways of writing on the Scribe:1) Annotating Kindle books - to the horror of my husband who thinks paper books are sacrosanct and should never be sullied by ink, I underline, highlight and annotate books.  I love buying a used book that someone before me has annotated.  I was initially disappointed that the Scribe does not allow annotating in the margins.  However, I quickly fell for adding handwritten notes to highlights (and the highlight can be minuscule).  It does keep the page clean and the notes can be rather copious.  It also creates a file of notes and their references.  Finally!  I can write in a library book!!2) Using native Scribe notebooks - based on my experience with the Mobiscribe, I thought that I'd use this the most.  I use it hardly at all.  It works quite well, but my beef with it is that, unlike the Mobiscribe, you cannot create your own templates or change page formats in the middle of a notebook.  (Ahem!  Amazon developers!!  I'm looking at you!)3) Annotating PDF's - Oh boy, do I use this extensively!  I buy a PDF notebook from an Etsy seller and happily scribble notes to my heart's content.  Sadly, this area is where the Scribe is the most buggy.  Sometimes (as mentioned above) PDF's simply can't be written on.  This appears to arise from three reasons.  1) the PDF wasn't uploaded correctly, 2) the PDF is in a format that the Scribe doesn't know how to handle, 3) the Scribe locks up.  So, how to fix these issues?First, just get into the habit of sending PDF's to the Scribe correctly.  There are a couple of ways to accomplish this.  1) Use the Send To Kindle web link: https://www.amazon.com/sendtokindle or 2) use the plug-in for Windows or Mac, a link to which can be found on the Send to Kindle page.  I'm lazy and prefer the plug-in.  I right-click on the file I want uploaded in Windows Explorer -> Send to -> Kindle.  It opens a little dialog box which, after the initial log in and choosing Scribe, sends it right to my Scribe.  Done.  Send via the email address?  No.  Send via a USB cable?  No.  Either use the web link or the plug-in and be done with it.2) PDF formatting issues.  I'd love to tell you exactly what the issue is here.  I've seen a couple of potential explanations on Reddit, and mistrust them.  I'm not sure anyone knows for sure right now.  I ran into the issue with a reading journal I bought on Etsy and the seller worked with me until he got it.  I didn't ask him what he changed.  I'm thinking that, at the moment, the Scribe is so new we're all rattling bones at it, hoping to stumble on the magic.  I'm hoping this will be fixed in future software releases.  (Yes, Amazon developers, I'm looking at you!)3) The Scribe simply locks up.  This seems to be an issue for those of us who extensively annotate PDFs.  I suspect a memory leak issue in the software that  gets fixed in a future software release (Yep, one more time, I'm looking at you, Amazon developers).  It could be a hardware issue if the processor chip needs to be more powerful.  The workarounds I've found depend on how badly the thing has locked up.  If the PDF either suddenly can't be written on or if the Scribe throws an error when trying to open a PDF, what frequently works is simply opening a Kindle book and then going back to the PDF.  If that doesn't work, a soft reboot from the top menu will usually clear its little brain and get things going again.  I have had it lock up so hard that the screen doesn't respond to anything.  That means a hard reboot with the switch on the side.  It's irritating to have this happen, but again, this is a first generation device, people!I know this review had gotten to the size of a blog post, and if you've gotten to this point thank you for staying with me.  There's more.There will always be people who complain that it isn't an iPad.  It's not supposed to be an iPad.  You want an iPad, buy an iPad.  The whole point of e-ink devices is that you don't have the distractions of a young full-blown computer.  You read.  You write.  We're done.  To me, the even bigger advantage is that there isn't the eyestrain of a tablet or computer.  You're not staring for hours into light emitted into your eyes.  I'm not knocking tablets.  I was a first generation adopter of the iPad those many years ago and use them happily still.  But for reading and now writing, give me an e-ink device.So, given that I've convinced you that a dedicated reader/writer is a good thing, why the Scribe?  This is trickier.  There are four major brands besides the Scribe, even the cheapest of which has features the Scribe doesn't have.  These four are Remarkable (now on Version2), Boox (and they have several devices to choose from), Ratta Supernote (a few devices), and MobiScribe.  I'd love to say I can review all four brands and compare/contrast.  I've used the Remarkable Version 1 and own both the original MobiScribe and the MobiScribe Origin.  Even the MobiScribe, the cheapest of the four, can do handwriting-to-text which the Scribe can't do (ahem).  So why would I go for the Scribe?  The biggest reason is the Kindle reading experience.  Kindle books can be read on the other devices, but with varying degrees of ease.  Because the Scribe was built by the people who built the Kindle, I expected Kindle books to be far better integrated and they are. At the moment, I'd say the Scribe is a perfect device for dedicated Kindle users.  If, however, you predominantly read PDFs, probably another device would be a better choice.  At least for now.The other reason the Scribe may be a good choice is the power of Amazon behind it.  Let's face it, if Amazon chooses to make the Scribe a success, listens to the early adopters and studies the abilities of the competition, they have the developmental horsepower to make this thing fly.  If, however, this first Scribe is a one-hit-wonder and Amazon decides that the market isn't big enough to justify the development costs, this thing is going to sink like the proverbial stone and I, for one, will be mad as a wet hen.  This is, unfortunately, a real possibility.  The number of consumers who want a dedicated e-ink writer are never going to be as great as those who want a more all-purpose tablet.  Amazon may decide that the e-ink reader market is where they're going to stay.  If that's their decision, I will cry.  Loudly.  Really loudly.If you made it this far, thanks for staying with me.  With all its quirks, I love the Scribe.  I hope you will, too.",651 people found this helpful

UPDATE!!!SEE BELOW...","Reviewed in the United States üá∫üá∏ on December 30, 2022",Option: Premium Pen | Setup: 64 GB | Offer Type: Without Kindle Unlimited,True,"Although this is pretty long, please read until the end for more helpful items i found to use with your SCRIBE or even other devices, ive mentioned extra protection and the perks of using 360 degree rotating magnetic charging cords and heads in ALL your devices! This review will go over regular tablets and 2 other brands of eink note taking devices. I touch on storage, pens, the paper templates, DRAWING...its a lot but def worth looking over. Might as well scroll down to the see more for my review and pull it all up now before you continue any further lol...i really hope this helps somebody on one of the things i mention.Ok I'm going to hit a few topics that I've noticed nobody has really hit on yet, and its something I had tried to find out myself before I bought mine, and I couldn't get that info so I just bought it! I should start by saying I currently have these other devices as well: 10in Samsung tablet, 10in IPad, fire tablet, almost every paperwhite, likebook ares eink tablet, onyx boox nova color eink tablet....and now the wonderful Kindle scribe! Now, let's talk business.I love to read, and the paperwhite has been my go to device all the time hands down for my reading...waterproof, lots of storage at 32 GB and great battery life! Reading comics however is a pain. To small, have to pinch and zoom....just to much hassle. It's the same thing on my other two eink devices, there is still no glare on these other 2 (likebook and boox), you get the min storage but can add micro SD cards, and those are not waterproof and the batteries run down so quickly even when in airplane mode. Now let's talk actual tablets (Samsung, Ipad, fire, etc)... obviously bigger screens, bright vivid colors. Have to install kindle app to read your books (except for on fire tablets), and now you can no longer purchase any new books on these devices unless you are using an actual Amazon brand device when buying them! Comics are much easier to read...and again  in color. You won't be able to read on your screens outside though, the sun will just bounce off device making it more useful for a mirror!! All of these devices will let you surf the web, shop, play games, listen to music or books, read...you name it. Books won't eat up too much of your storage since it's just words but comics sure will. And I don't know about you all, but my batteries on these devices drain faster then say a paperwhite.Here's what I wanted to know-Not only do I read a lot, but I'm an artist. I love to just be able to pull something out of my bag and draw if the mood hits. I noticed people only touched on the ""note taking"" abilities on the scribe...but I wanted to know MORE!! I wanted to see the pen line thickness for each option, see if when you did the  highlighter over the pen if the black would fade, what other pens could be used on it, if we could install more paper options for free directly into notebook paper options!!Let's talk tablets first for drawing and doodling. Fire tablets don't offer to many great drawing apps for people who like to draw. There's sketch guru and sketchbook abd a few just bare min basic apps. But I'm not overly impressed with how they run on these devices and what they offer. Samsung which is android has a bunch due to playstore (I'd list them all but I'd be here all day) art rage, sketch guru, ibis paint, sketch book...a lot. And Ipad, do I even have to say it lol, one word... Procreate! The great things about creating art on these tablets is that you have unlimited color options, shading abilities, tools like shapes and rulers, layer of pages, pens, pencils and brushes etc. I however, and this is me personally lol, don't like drawing on them ( I have, but not since I got my first eink reader and note device) my lines are all over the place, if I have to pick my pen up it's time consuming to get back on the same line I left off its just a flat out pain and it annoyed me! To some they found tricks and have mastered it...not me though lol...give me pen and paper and some color and im good!As for the eink devices. My ares likebook was my first with the ability to write on it. Sure I download my kindle app (but I never really read on it, used paperwhite everytime for that). I was able to access Google playstore, install all the same apps I had on Samsung tablet, could surf web, and do all the stuff I could on Samsung, fire and Ipad. Drawing on apps installed from playstore was horrible on this device. It lagged and I'd have to wait for my line or what I just drew to appear to continue to even draw. Now in the notebook section though it was amazing! Just like pencil or pen to paper, and it's pressure sensitive. The likebook only has 2 pen options, a ballpoint pen and a calligraphy pen. It gives you a few thicknesses to use however the thickest option isn't even as thick as say for example, a Crayola marker tip. The eraser function has the ability to erase entire area, each individual line by just tapping a line to erase, circling an item to erase. It also has gray, red and blue scale options when using pen but those are a joke because I never even noticed a difference, it was still just well, black!! Next device was my boox nova color eink device, all the above for likebook is exactly the same except for when I was in the notebook area, the options are 100% different and better. As far as pen option, you can pick between ballpoint pen, marker, pencil, highlighter, calligraphy pen, and a paintbrush! Yeah I know awesome right?! You can convert your written notes to text, move and drag items, layer, change templates, it has shapes like circle, square, line, etc. Honestly, it does a lot and it's in COLOR!!! Mine has 18 colors. I was so excited for this BUT I'm not overly impressed. I can't shade or blend using any said brushes or any of the colors. It literally just changes to color selected and thats it. If I draw a picture say like a caricature in black and then fill it in with colors, my black Baseline just disappears, even when using the highlighter, so then I have to go back in and redraw my lines which is a pain. And yes, I know, these devices are more so for taking notes not necessarily for drawing. I get it lol, but do you realize how sweet it is to have 1 device that does it all; day or night, inside or out?! It allows me to carry a lot less in my purse just bust something out because I want draw suddenly lol! The one really neat thing about both the ares and the boox, they have several different types of paper patterns and themes to pick from pre installed but they also allow you to download other ones too and add them right to your notebook. Like budget trackers, or savings tracker, shopping list or booklist, planners, goal setting worksheets, blank comic book pages!! It's endless, you want it, you can get and get it for free!! And you can make each page a different paper in your notebook! Believe me when I say this, but that is a huge convenience!Now onto the scribe. I enjoy reading in this which is surprising because I'm so used to the size of my paperwhite, which since getting my scribe, has been retired üòÖ.  If you're familiar with the paperwhite then you'll notice it's pretty much the same just a much bigger screen. As far as comics go, they are incredibly clear and very easy to read without any eyestrain (you'll just have to make do with the Grayslake colors, but you'll be OK I promise)! I went for the 64GB because I plan to draw, a lot, on this bad boy. I have 32 GB on my paperwhite and have over 4,000 (closer to 5,000 with no signs of stopping) books on that and a chunk of them are comics (like the walking dead com. sets) and I haven't even used so much as half of my 32GB on that. So it didn't even put a dent in my scribe storage of 64GB! Just like all of Amazon's ereaders this is a distraction free device...no apps, no emails or games or whatnot. I'm fine with that in fact i actually prefer that. After I install any new books I tend to keep all my devices in airplane mode (stretches out my battery life even longer). Ok so let's talk about drawing on the scribe. You get one pen with 5 thicknesses to pick from, a highlighter with 5 thicknesses, and an ereaser with 5 thicknesses to pick from plus an option to erease page or an option to circle what you want to erase for it to erase. That's is folks. No extra fancy tools or other pens, no write to text or layering or dragging and moving items or resizing or copy and paste...yet. Maybe one day. You get like either 12 or 15 styles of paper to pick from, however that one notebook will be that style of paper throughout. Page 1 can be lined but then so will every other page in that notebook until you create another notebook. It's annoying, but I just pick a paper I want for a drawing like say I need gragh or dot, select do my drawing, then go in and change it to blank so the next page is blank as well as the paper under what i just drew. I do wish they had a planner (free lol), savings tracker, shopping list, a booklist...cmon at least a book wishlist its a kindle haha! I also really wish that like my other 2 note taking eink devices you could install other paper options into the notebook paper selections...but you can't. You get what  you get unless you buy a planner through keys2success starting at $25 and going up to $150! Anyways, back to drawing, sorry. So this is exactly like drawing on paper!!! Unlike my other 2 eink devices it is NOT pressure sensitive. If you pick up your pen you can very easily pick up right where you left off which I always had a hard time doing on Samsung, ipad and fire. So the the thicknesses of pen options: heavy is just like using a Crayola marker, nice thick bold line. Thick is like a sharpie. Medium would be like a felt tip pen and is less bold then previous two. Then the last two would be like a ballpoint pen or a calligraphy pen, and you last option would be like a very fine tip micro pen. I use these last two pens for all my fine detail and some of my ""ink shading"" if you will. It works amazingly and I'm really picky about pens on these devices and how they preform. Im quite surprised since in videos i watched it seemed bare min compared to my boox. Amazon has not let me down! Pressure isn't an issue because of the sizes they offer in pen options, you just have to use them properly. The highlighter, ok, I AM IMPRESSED! If I highlight over anything I've drawn with it...my black baseline remains, I can't believe it. I'm sold lol! So yeah you won't lose any of your work when you highlight. So it has roughly the same thicknesses available it just doesn't get as fine as the pen options. Think of the thinnest highlighter you've seen and we'll that's the smallest it'll go. If you, say color in something in with the highlighter, and then say use it again in just one area you've colored already to try and make it a little darker, it won't. The eraser thickness options are just like the highlighter, you can't erase just one thing because it may wipe out a larger area but the undo and redo buttons are great for quick mess ups. I tried using the eraser at its finest tip for highlights in hair and well...that didn't work out so well, it erased big areas. Kind of wish they had a micro eraser available for that. The eraser does have the circle to erase option, so I guess you could circle say like and eye or part of the eye to erase that way. They also have an erase page option. I use the undo and redo buttons a lot lol. I really enjoy drawing on this even  though I don't have all the features I have at my fingertips with boox notebook. Do I wish scribe had these features, absolutely! It'd knock those big ticket items right out of the park. I have no issues using the smaller pens to shade and detail and then use the highlighter to really pop those features in my drawings I want to stand out. I'm not gonna address the note taking other than  by saying it's crisp, clear, and your letters are all connected and not cutoff and hands down the BEST note taking device I have when it comes to handwriting. The size is absolutely perfect for everything I use it for. I can't wait to see what features and pens they have on future updates for my scribe, and I really hope that they add more paper options (FREE paper options lol) to our notebooks. You can however send pdfs of different paper to your scribe, but its a pain and not convenient. It gets added to your library and its just 1 sheet when you may need several so it kind of stinks that way. And I don't know about anyone else but I want all my notes and drawings located in one spot, not mixed in with my books and in my library. That would make my Scribe the ultimate all in one tool! I'm fine without color because sadly eink color isn't quite there yet for me. I do own several EMR pens (of course lol) as well. I have the ones that came with my boox and ares, I have the lammy pen, the Norris steadlier jumbo pencil, wacom pens, the heart of metal pen (has a ceramic nib that never needs to be replaced) and the premium pen for the Scribe. Here's what I've found out, all of these pens/stylus work on the Scribe thankfully. I will not use my heart of metal on my Scribe but I'm sure it will work. I'm just nervous because the nib is hard and I don't want to scratch or ruin my screen ( if you're crazy enough to try it ha ha let me know how you make out!). And Although some of these nibs are different sizes it does not effect the size or width of the lines you draw or write with on the Scribe.I'm sorry this review is so long. I just couldn't get this info myself when looking into to purchasing it and no one said anything about drawing on it, pens, or did side by side comparisons. I watched a lot of YouTube reviews and read all the comments and still didn't find what all I wanted to know lol so I really hope.this helps someone else. I am obsessed with my Scribe, between reading and drawing...it's the only one I'm carrying on me at all times and using at home. My other expensive over priced eink note taking tablets are now sitting on a shelf in my room. I think with new updates they launch its just gonna get better and better and it's pretty damn awesome already. Great battery life (nothing i own can ever beat amazons paperwhite and now scribe battery life), lots of storage and I mean lots, great clear clean writing and drawing experience and EVERYTHING is crisp on the screen. If you're on the fence just jump off and buy it already, you won't beat the price and I'm honestly surprised it doesn't cost more...you won't regret your choice. And if one of the other devices I mentioned sounds better for your needs do that (boox does have non colored eink devices that have same features and everything as the colored eink device. Incase anyone wondered lol). Happy reading, drawing and writing...hope this helps someone!One more bonus side note, I have the kindle fabric case for my Scribe. I was nervous to just toss it into my purse and keep it there on a daily basis just in it's kindle case. I did a lot of searching for an additional measure of safety and found this nifty universal bag/case on Amazon. Type in FINPAC tablet case in search bar. This case is extremely useful and just excellent! It has a front pouch which I store an extra battery charger, my cords, all my stylus', my magnetic head attacents for cords (another Amazon buy...and if you don't have these kinds of cords yet you seriously should check them out. I have a combo pack so my cords are from 3 ft up to 10ft, got several sets of each kind of head...micro, c type, apple...and my cords where heads attach actually rotate 360 degrees so ny cord wont bend and break. Best of all, i leave the actual head nib in my devices and it saves all my devices charging ports because over time they tend to get loose and then your device wont charge. Its a life/device saver. Check them out, trust me lol!) and replacement nibs, a wallet, chapstick and my keys lol...just in the front pouch,the only pouch! The large tablet portion has reinforced corners so it's extra protection for your device, it has a soft velvet type material inside over a thick foam type material. The gray fabric also has a diamond type stitching, which one wouldn't think a big deal but, that actually helps to eliminate even more pressure that may be put on your device! It also comes with a shoulder strap so you can just take this as your bag and go, but the strap can also be removed. It has a handle on the back of case if you'd prefer to just carry it that way as well. Right this minute I'm using it as my actual purse since it has exactly what I want and need anyways ha ha, but if needed to I can just remove the straps and still toss it then in an actual purse and go! My Scribe still fits in this bag nice and secure with the case on and the stylus in the loop! Like I said, looked into an extra layer of protection for my device, many were going to be too big and my device would slide around which I didnt want, or else it'd be way too tight in there. Many cases I saw,  the protection of padding either just has foam with mesh looking more like a sponge, or just that soft velvety lining, this one had that stitching which just helps even more to absorb any shock or to distribute pressure evenly or eliminate it all. I did see just another case, it was a case sleeve only, it was black with the inside having the padding with black small circles which would also do really well for our device (sorry forgot the nameü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è) but I just overall love the functionality of this particular bag/sleeve. I am soooooo pleased with this, and it does the job great. The outter material is scratch resistant, and waterproof and the zippers work and are made with great quality material. If you're looking for an extra great layer of added protection or just an easier way to take it with you, check it out. FINPAC 11in tablet case, it was a prime item, and Amazon's choice, and i got mine the very next day after ordering! I want to say it was $23.99. Great buy and a must have if you're like me and plan to take it everywhere with you!****UPDATE ABOUT KINDLES LATEST SCRIBE BRUSHES UPDATE***OMG!!! Amazon hit it out the park with the brushes!!! This is my ONLY let me stress this fact ***ONLY *** eink device that actually let's you use the pencil feature like a real a pencil, meaning you can even use the sides of your stylus to shade. You now even have pressure abilities as well!! The 5 pencil options are like almost going from like an h to an 8b type pencil (which is just a fancy term for hardness in lead and darkness lol for the non artist out there) but man they did such and incredible job with the pencil feature. I'm stunned!!! Wasn't expecting that! I'm also loving the fountain pen as well, it's insane. My boox color has all of these BUT for some reason when I compare them my scribe is sooooo much h better.  And like I said whennit comes to the pencil none of my eink devices have the ability to use the side of the stylus of the abilities to shade as well as it does on the scribe even though they too are pressure sensitive. Amazon nailed it with the brushes on this update! Now hopefully they add some tools, shapes like lines, circles, etc.; layering, copy and paste, lasso to resize and move and image around on page, being able to change paper selections in notebooks would be HUGE too! This is truly become my all in 1 go to device and Amazon has and the kindle have become and huge part of my life and I haven't strayed...when I have I haven't been to pleased and always seem to come back lol only to place the others on a shelf to sit and collect dust. My battery is still going off of only a 2nd charge and I got at xmas and use it everyday for about 6hrs a day (I know a bit extreme ) sometimes I am on wifi but I try to keep it on airplane mode a lot to save my battery.  It's a GREAT device and I am obsessed even more now with the update lmao!",559 people found this helpful
"Introducing Kindle Scribe (16 GB), the first Kindle for reading and writing, with a 10.2‚Äù 300 ppi Paperwhite display, includes Basic Pen",5.0,Excellent New Device.  Exceeds Expectations.,"Reviewed in the United States üá∫üá∏ on December 18, 2022",Option: Basic Pen | Setup: 16 GB | Offer Type: Without Kindle Unlimited,True,"I struggled with the decision to purchase the new Kindle Scribe.  I have had several kindles (going all the way back to the Kindle with a keyboard) and a few Kindle Fires.  I currently have a Kindle Paperwhite and Fire 8 plus.  I have always valued the reading experience on kindles along with the ability to have access to a library of books, obtain samples of books, and a convenient way to highlight and add sticky notes.  I was initially excited to see the Scribe come out, but the price and some negative reviews really gave me pause.  At the urging of my spouse as a Christmas present and convincing myself that I would return it if it didn‚Äôt meet my expectations I decided to take the plunge.  I am so glad I did.  It has exceeded my expectations in all three of my must haves.  I decided to write this review in hopes of helping others going back and forth about whether to purchase it now or wait for a future update.As a little background, I am in academia.  I decided that I would purchase and keep the Kindle Scribe if it did an excellent job with The following.1)  Able to read textbooks and technical books with tables, charts, graphs, and math.2)  Able to read pdfs.3)  Able to write notes (lecture notes, answer keys, personal research notes, etc.)Based upon the previous reviews, I was not confident that the Scribe would do a great job with all three of the above must haves.  However, it does.  I‚Äôll take each one separately with my pros/cons and fixes.1) With my previous kindles (including my current paperwhite and Fire), I was never able to have that wonderful reading experience when it came to textbooks and/or more technical books which included tables, charts, graphs, and math.  The physical size of the previous kindles simply was never going to work well with these types of books, even with the zoom feature.  The size, and perfection of the screen, of the Scribe makes reading these types of books just as enjoyable as reading a book of fiction.  The technical stuff comes across wonderfully and there‚Äôs no funky formatting that the previous kindles would have when it comes to tables, charts, etc.  So, the Scribe passed with flying colors when it come to this must have.  In response to some other reviews, I will say that I‚Äôm actually glad that I cannot write (make notes, underline, circle) on the books themselves.  I like writing a sticky note and highlighting because it keeps the pages less cluttered.  Looking back at physical books that I‚Äôve had to read many times over the years, I have written so many notes in the margins, underlined, etc. that it makes reading them again a pain.  I hope that Amazon will always keep the option of sticky notes even if one day it allows writing directly on the book.  Given the price, did I need the Scribe?  No.  I could‚Äôve just continued to read these types of books as physical books.  But, I am so glad that I can do it on the Scribe and have the wonderful kindle reading experience.  My only complaint is that a few books purchased in the past don‚Äôt recognize the pen.  This might just be an issue of needing to reformat all books and hopefully it will be fixed in the future.  Even with those few books, I can still type sticky notes and highlight as before so it hasn‚Äôt bee a big deal.2)  Given the size of previous Kindles, sending a pdf and reading it just was never going to work well.  The Scribe does a near perfect job.  Now, having read some reviews, I was really worried about this must have.  I read lots of pdfs from my laptop for my job, and as I sit reading look over to my Paperwhite and wish that I could use it instead (the E-ink is just so much better).  Here‚Äôs my take on pdfs, if the pdf is nicely formatted to begin with then it comes across on the Scribe perfectly.  Yes, you can write on it which is nice (kind of wish I could use sticky notes instead though) and easily export it to your email address.  On the other hand, if the pdf is not nicely formatted and/or the text is a bit blurry to begin with, then it doesn‚Äôt come to the Scribe perfectly either of course.  I have played around with preparing these troublesome pdfs by cropping or simply changing the margin size before sending and it seems to help, but the text is not as crisp.  Still though, I can read the pdfs on the Scribe just as easily as reading them on my laptop.  So, overall, the Scribe exceeded my expectations here.  One strange thing I‚Äôve come across is that when initially opening a pdf, it opens to a cover page so you have to actually go to the beginning by opening up the toolbar at the top then you can flip the pages.  This is an example of needing to play around a bit with the Scribe to figure out some of the features.  The entire focus on the ‚Äúcover‚Äù thing in pdfs and notes seemed to be a big thing with the tech folks, might be a privacy issue they have in mind.  I realize that some folks, myself included, use Google drive and other web-based options to store documents, but Amazon has done an excellent job of allowing the user to drag and drop a document into the Send to Kindle page/app (and, I make sure to choose the option to send only to my Scribe rather than clutter up all my devices).  I have only tried one Word document so far but it came across perfectly on the Scribe.  If you have a book pdf, you can simply write Chapter 1, 2, etc. on the page of each chapter then go to the notes to easily move to where you want to go.  So, I have been extremely happy with this feature which would‚Äôve been a deal breaker for me.3)  Others have said that writing on the Scribe feels nearly the same as writing on paper and it does.  I plan to write lecture notes, answer keys, and just some notes for myself.  Amazon has done a great job in allowing the notebooks to be easily sent to my email address as pdfs, and they come across on my laptop and Fire exactly has I‚Äôve written them.  I am really, really pleased with this aspect.  In the past, I would scribble an answer key or some notes on a lecture (including Graphs and math) on some scrap paper then a year later when teaching the class again realize that I‚Äôd lost the notes and have to redo them.  I will be doing all my writing on the Scribe and storing them for latter use.  Having read some reviews, it sounded like the current software on the Scribe was not up to the competition.  I have to say, however, I am very pleased with the existing software.  You don‚Äôt get twenty different widths for the pen but rather five.  I really don‚Äôt want to have to choose from a great many, and what they have now is just fine for my needs.  It is true that you don‚Äôt have subfolders to create and a large notebook would be difficult to find things in.  I get all of those issues.  However, instead of writing a 100 page notebook I plan to write lecture notes in 10 notebooks of 10 pages in length saved under one folder.  By using appropriate titles for each notebook I think it will actually be better than having one rather lengthy notebook.  There‚Äôs not a great many templates to choose from, but I have found the ones currently available work just fine for my needs.  Again, though, the Kindle Scribe exceeded my expectation for writing notes.Overall, I am thrilled with the Kindle Scribe.  I really enjoy the reading and writing experience.  Given the price, did I absolutely need the Scribe?  Not really.  I could read the physical textbooks/technical books.  I could read the pdfs on my laptop.  I could write notes on paper then scan them into my computer.  Or, of course, I could do these things on a good tablet.  However, I have always enjoyed the reading experience on a kindle and the Scribe might be the best yet.  The writing experience on the Scribe is the closest digital device to paper that I have used.  I am glad to have these things on one device which does not have all the distractions that come with laptops and tablets.  I hope this review helps others in making their decisions.  Oh, and as others have said, the battery is amazing compared to tablets and phones.",100 people found this helpful
"Introducing Kindle Scribe (16 GB), the first Kindle for reading and writing, with a 10.2‚Äù 300 ppi Paperwhite display, includes Basic Pen",4.0,QUIRKY CUBBY FOR KINDLE READERS WHO WRITE,"Reviewed in the United States üá∫üá∏ on December 8, 2022",Option: Premium Pen | Setup: 64 GB | Offer Type: Without Kindle Unlimited,True,"Ah, the joys of a new Kindle! Turn it on and the familiar typeset, newsprint, fountain pen and ink screensavers evoke the days of analog living. I could almost smell the inked paper when I powered up my Kindle Scribe for the first time. Sound familiar? Read on, this quirky new Kindle may be for you.Like many avid Kindle users, I embrace the hints of atmosphere, elegance, and craftsmanship of days gone by, without having to give up the ease modern technology affords. Amazon has always positioned Kindle to beckon to this target market, crafting a distraction-free enclave into which to retreat for the joys of reading. Now if only we could capture the thoughts, ideas, and emotions that reading kindles in our minds (see what I did there?), without having to leave this delightful inner nook!Enter the Kindle Scribe. Not only a portable library of books personally curated to suit your tastes, the Scribe also offers up a clean stack of notebooks, blank pages brimming with potential, spines labeled by content, bottomless sticky notes, and a hardy pen nestled beside them on your virtual bookshelf.And that‚Äôs it. The Kindle Scribe is not a tablet, smartphone, or smart anything else. It is a minimalist digital analogue for paper‚Äînow not only for reading, but for writing as well.Reviews from users and ‚Äúexperts‚Äù I read before my Scribe arrived typically faulted the Scribe largely on the grounds that it is not an iPad or this or that digital notetaking competitor. If you want that kind of comparison, this review is not for you. There are plenty of those already, and I don‚Äôt know anything about any of those devices. When I want tablet functionality, I use my tablet. I'm zany like that.Folks seem to miss the point that this is a ‚ÄúKINDLE/Scribe.‚Äù It aligns with the Kindle ethos of providing a distraction-free, electronic experience akin to analog that favors simplicity over clutter. Piling the Scribe with excess features would morph it into something else entirely, destroying the Kindle hallmark of cozy enclosure. If you get this, you will likely enjoy the Scribe‚Äôs style. If not, you won‚Äôt.Here are the top ten things I am enjoying about the Scribe, right out of the box.1. READING EXPERIENCE is flawless, with most Kindle reading features, such as customizing the view by font, size, alignment, reading progress, Word Wise, and the like. Scribe retains 300ppi resolution despite the increased screen space. Landscape and portrait options are available either manually or via gyroscope, depending on content. Magazines, journals, technical books, and those with hefty footnotes are far more pleasing to take in than a Kindle. Pages turn by a touch or swipe with finger or pen (I use the eraser side to avoid wear on the tip).2. INDUSTRIAL DESIGN is masterful. Aluminum case, pleasing to look at as well as slim and a joy to hold, despite the larger size. The sleek case made by Amazon is unintrusive and complements the hardware. The cover wakes and sleeps the Scribe. Origami folds have high and low vertical easel positions.3. KINDLEVERSE. Seamless continuity with my Kindle library, without the need to use an app or third-party software with limited functionality. Borrowed ebooks from library, same. Last page read and non-handwritten content syncs between Kindle devices and apps as usual.4. BATTERY LIFE is Olympic, given the size and functionality. Mine came charged to 61%, and it is still going despite much testing, syncing, reading, markup, and notebook creation. Too early yet for me to gauge how long one charge lasts with normal use. USB-C port for charging is handy.5. WRITING EXPERIENCE is outstanding, and feels very much like paper. The pen scritches satisfyingly as it travels across the page, um, I mean, screen. It is smooth, with no noticeable latency and a few options for a nib thickness, highlighting, and erasing. My handwriting looks like my handwriting. The customizable shortcut button on the premium pen allows easy access to the feature you use most. It does not need a battery and clips magnetically to the side of the Scribe. Any Wacom pen works on the Scribe, and vice versa. You can move the writing toolbar to the left or right, or remove it altogether whenever you prefer an unencumbered space. I have tried the Scribe twice now to take notes continuously during a two hour live translation session. It is a dream, and cost me about 15% battery with lights and all features blazing.6. NOTEBOOKS. So much chatter about dazzling e-note features other, differently positioned devices have and Scribe lacks obscures what is on offer. Eighteen templates: narrow, college, and wide horizontal ruled, each with or without a vertical margin line; vertical ruled with and without header line; blank; square and dot grid; checklist; daily, weekly, and monthly calendars; tracker; storyboard; and sheet music. Naming, storing, and accessing notebooks is easy, and email sharing is a breeze.7. IT‚ÄôS LIT! Ambient light sensor, warmth settings, and dark mode foster a pleasant, unobtrusively customized experience‚Äîakin to having Jeeves hovering in the wings, silently adjusting lamps or lighting candles for your reading comfort.8. AUDIBLE AND TEXT TO SPEECH. I love audiobooks and still miss the text to speech functions of older Kindles. The Scribe offers both, via Bluetooth.9. STICKY NOTES. This feature, used to annotate ebooks, has limitations, but is far more pleasant than keying in notes on a regular Kindle. Notes from one book or document can be exported into a single file.10. LIMITED DISTRACTIONS. No apps. No videos. Barebones internet browser. Basic notebook functionality means it is easy to learn.Just as my first Kindle gave me ready access to a curated library everywhere, the Scribe keeps my notes at my fingertips, even when I am too far‚Äîor too lazy‚Äîto access my (many, many) notebooks. I‚Äôve even started using storyboards and mind maps because of the available templates. In short, the Kindle Scribe enhances my reading experience through modest writing features that mimic analog usage.Call me crazy, but I think that is implicit in what a ‚ÄúKINDLE/Scribe‚Äù is meant to do. I look forward to improvements to make the interface even better.For example, there is no way to customize the Home screen, which devotes far more space to purchase recommendations than my ebooks‚ÄîAmazon will be Amazon. Some glitches could use attention, like using a back arrow in some areas and a close box in others to move out of a particular function. Landscape orientation activates by gyroscope for some interfaces, and manual selection in others. Moveing the writing toolbar happens within the shortcut, but you have to go to the general dropdown menu to remove it. It is cumbersome to move between ebook to notebook, and impossible to use notebooks while listening to Audible audiobooks. It would be great to send audiobooks borrowed from my public library to the Scribe, like ebooks (a feature that depends on collaboration with library software providers). Amazon Customer Service agents I contacted with questions seemed even less knowledgeable about Kindle Scribe than I am.In addition, I think Amazon would have done well to premiere the Scribe with features that snuggle well with the Kindle spirit. Here is my top five wish list in that regard:1. STICKY NOTES. Currently, sticky notes that happen in Scribe, stay in Scribe. This is the most egregious omission, to my mind. Syncing notes, highlights, bookmarks, etc. across devices is a cornerstone of Kindleness. Yet non-Scribe devices or Kindle apps cannot edit sticky notes. They cannot view them. In fact, they give no indication they even exist. You have to wonder who thought this was okay. Sticky notes need to be accessible across Kindle devices and apps in some way.2. NOTEBOOKS. The notebook system should be robust, with nesting subfolders, using different templates within a single notebook, inserting and moving pages within notebooks, default cover page selection, custom templates, and easy switching between notebook and ebook, audiobook, or PDF/document view. Kindle apps can view notebooks, but I have not find a way to access them on Kindle devices. Add text recognition with search, sort, share, and related functions.3. WRITING. Give me scribble, markup, and highlight options in ebooks, not just sticky notes. Lavish me with pen nib styles, thicknesses, and sensitivity options. Basic drawing too.4. FILES. Let ‚ÄúSend to Kindle‚Äù be an option rather than a requirement for e-note functionality in PDFs and documents other than Kindle books.5. WATERPROOF. I often write with coffee, tea, or water beside me. Enough said.Had I paid less, these missing pieces would be less troublesome. At this price point, I don‚Äôt want to have to repurchase a new generation in a year‚Äôs time. Even with the trade-in discount, the Scribe is twice the price of the Oasis. Apparently, the days when Amazon underpriced its devices to snag a big chunk of the market, or even carve out a new niche, are behind us. I‚Äôm not sure how wise this is in a field already populated by similar and successful devices (I‚Äôm looking at you, Fire Phone). It seems Amazon took the Scribe market for granted and went lazy on the software. Or perhaps the plan was to release a supersized Oasis and at the last minute, they figured they toss in some writing features, despite being half-baked. Nevertheless, Amazon certainly has the heft to polish an already lovely device into a spectacular one in harmony with the Kindle aesthetic.Interestingly, the sleek climate-pledge packaging features an image of a handwritten note on a Scribe that reads: ‚ÄúTransformation => small consistent changes.‚Äù A harbinger of things to come? I like to think so. For now, the Scribe is a delight to use and a welcome addition to my bookish toy box. Don‚Äôt let the naysayers with a bone to pick or undue eagerness to gather likes and followers sway you.This is a quirky little cubby for Kindle readers who write. No other device serves this niche this well.Since I have a penchant for naming items that I use often, my Scribe is called Edith, after the ‚Äúugly duckling‚Äù middle sister of Downton Abbey who blooms into the swan she always was as time softens her rough edges and reveals her many undiscovered merits. Time will tell whether Scribe imitates art ‚Ä¶TWO WEEK UPDATE: Endearing is not a word I typically associate with electronics, but without a doubt, I find the Scribe to be precisely that. Despite the lacunae on the enote side of things, the Scribe is such a joy to use that I find new ways to incorporate it daily. Even without welcome upgrades to the software, I already cannot imagine being without the comfortable screen for reading and the surprisingly useful enote functionality. It complements my Voyage nicely and then some. If you are on the fence about the Kindle Scribe, it is well worth giving it a try.ONE MONTH UPDATE: Still enjoying it, though it definitely feels like Amazon was planning to supersize the Oasis and then tacked on the writing features at the last minute and changed the name to Scribe. Enough to get out of the gate, but it could be a truly stellar product with a few adjustments. For Kindle readers who love the feel of pen and paper though, or those who benefit from the larger reading surface, it is hard to beat.On another note, watch for price reductions. On January 6, 2023, barely a month after releasing the Scribe with no discount, Amazon offered about 15% off the various options, including bundles, refusing to credit original purchasers who paid full price. Odd choice for ""Earth's most customer-centric company,"" but there it is. If you are willing to take the chance that Amazon will not undercut the price at your expense shortly after you purchase, go ahead and pay full price. Otherwise, consider a competitor's product or wait until Amazon issues another promotion, nearly guaranteed on Prime Day, if not sooner.",575 people found this helpful
"Introducing Kindle Scribe (16 GB), the first Kindle for reading and writing, with a 10.2‚Äù 300 ppi Paperwhite display, includes Basic Pen",4.0,Hoping to combine my Remarkable 2 with a Kindle. ***Third Update***,"Reviewed in the United States üá∫üá∏ on December 7, 2022",Option: Premium Pen | Setup: 32 GB | Offer Type: Without Kindle Unlimited,True,"¬†I am a life long Kindle user going back to the first gen with onboard network at no cost and a keyboard. Still have it actually. My last Kindle is the last generation Oasis which I generally love but the battery is starting to go and the included leather battery case is starting to seriously degrade from too many pool and beach days. Additionally, I have been using the Remarkable 2 for about a year now. I love it. I have all of my note handy in any meeting. I have home and work to do lists that literally manage my life. However, all of my ebooks are consumed via Kindle and I read a lot. The Remarkable supports ePub and what not but that isn't my thing. I love the simplicity Amazon has created for me here. I don't want to download books on a laptop and then drop them into my Remarkable. Sounds trivial but it is a step. So, I was pumped and immediately ordered the Scribe when I saw it. I have been using it regularly now,  side by side with my with my Remarkable, to gauge if the Scribe could be an all in one solution for me. These are my early thoughts but they are hardly complete as this is a very nuanced debate.Build: The Remarkable 2 has a better feel. Both the premium pen and the device feel just a little better constructed on the Remarkable. Both feel good but the Remarkable wins here. The Scribe's premium pen struggles to erase consistently which is irritating. That said, both feel great to write with. Further, it is clear to me that Amazon really took the writing part seriously. There is virtually zero lag on the Scribe. The Remarkable has low lag but the Kindle is clearly faster and more rewarding to write with. The Scribe is also back-lit and it is very good. That is a big win for Amazon. I give the edge in overall build to Remarkable but the Scribe has done enough in other places to make it a tough call.Processor and speed: This one isn't even a contest. I haven't looked up the processing specs and I will for my next update but I really don't need to. The Scribe is so much faster in everything it does. Page turns and searches are so much better here. Everything from menu access to flipping from one notebook to the next is better on the Scribe. It is actually painful to use my Remarkable in some ways now.Last Remarkable comparison points: The Remarkable make sharing work easier for now though it isn't seemless. The Scribe is clunky in this area. Note transcription is an area that Remarkable is clearly more refined in for instance. The thing is, while I love the idea, I don't use it that much personally but I know many do. If you are taking note, sharing them with colleagues, transcribing them to text, and using your device as a workhorse, The Scribe isn't ready for you. I think it will be but it isn't there now. Of you are like me, and like to have all your notes in one handy device, the Scribe works even if the software isn't perfect yet.As a Kindle: For me this is homerum city. The Scribe is absolutely Amazon's best Kindle for reading. It is much larger, still reasonably light, and is so much faster and more capable. You can take notes here while reading which is okay bit clunky. Do not buy this if you hope to make indepth annotations or comments on your books. Making little sticky notes comments isn't the best. Better than nothing but not a reason to buy.So, in conclusion, for me, this is a tough one. I am going 4 stars with hope for software improvements that take it to 4.5 to 5. The speed, backlight, functional note taking and customizable folders / notebooks make it enough to recommend but only if you want to really use a digital notebook. I do. I love it. Therefore, for me, having the ability to marry my Remarkable and my Kindle, even if it isn't quite perfect, is enough for me to recommend. Much more to come.***First Update*** So, week one is in the books and I was able to travel with the Scribe across the country which I find to be a great way to get to know a device like this. I don‚Äôt often have five or six hours in a day to read and write. As I write this, I am on my plane back to Detroit from LA and just got done doing some reading and then some work. I have a couple of more thoughts here. The first is that the software needs to be improved. It is not as easy as it should be to switch between reading and note taking. It goes like this: Tap the top of the screen, tap Home, then scroll to what you want to switch to, and click again. Not the end of the world, but not ideal. Some sort of carousel at the bottom or top that you could call up would be ideal. Again, the speed of the device is better than any E-Ink device I have ever used which does minimize the inconvenience, but it could be better. I also just noticed the lack of pressure sensitivity in the last few days. I never used it much with the Remarkable, but I do think it is worth noting as many likely will. I do not think I mentioned the lack of waterproofing. That is a pretty large omission for me as this is the most expensive Kindle and nearly every other now made has waterproofing for a whole lot less. Now, I need to be more careful at the pool or beach and that might force me to buy a different Kindle for those purposes. This would defeat a lot of the device reduction purpose my Scribe investment set out to achieve. I have to think that through but it may be a deal breaker for me. On the positive side, like all Kindles, the battery life is outstanding. I have barely moved the needle on this four day trip and have spent a number of hours reading and writing. Really impressive! Also, worth noting, unlike others, I find the Premium Leather Case to be a really good addition. If you are going to do buy the Scribe, I think you should really consider that investment as well. I will update as I decide if I will make this work. So far though, the Scribe is a really good reader that has some work to do as a true multi functioning work asset.***Second Update*** Okay, I had my first glitch. The panel started recognizing the pencil maybe a centimeter off of the device, meaning both that it was writing before the pencil was touching and when it was being pulled off the panel. The results were a big mess. I tried to reboot and it was still doing it. I then went to Kindle mode, opened a book, and tried to make a note. It was fine. Went back to notebook mode and it was back to working normally. I cannot get it to replicate but I will be busy with the device this week and will update if it rerurns. Strange and it has me a little spooked. Also, a software thing I really miss from Remarkable. It sounds small, but one of the options in the pencil drop down in Remarkable's menu is a little dash. When clicked, it allows you to circle things you have  written and  then cut or copy it for easy moving or large erasing jobs. Amazon needs to add this to the next update ASAP. Something I use often and will miss if I keep the Scribe. More to come...***Third Update***So, thanks to our friends on the web, I solved my pen problem. I had jammed the tip to far into the pencil and it thought I was pressing down on the panel even though I was a good half inch of it. I pulled it out and reinserted it. Problem solved. Today is the last day I can return the Scribe and I am keeping it. The ability to have my Kindle and my notes together is just too strong for me to go back. That said, the Scribe isn't perfect. I am absolutely banking on Amazon providing significant improvements here. I think Amazon has been clear about the mission here so I am going to go along for the ride. If you need a workhorse writing tablet right now, this isn't it. If you want the best reader ever made and like the idea of having a robust note taking partner, this is absolutely something you need to buy.  I will wrap up in a couple of months, but, for me, the Scribe does enough to warrant the investment.",408 people found this helpful
"Introducing Kindle Scribe (16 GB), the first Kindle for reading and writing, with a 10.2‚Äù 300 ppi Paperwhite display, includes Basic Pen",4.0,"Good Bones, Needs Some Improvement","Reviewed in the United States üá∫üá∏ on April 1, 2023",Option: Premium Pen | Setup: 32 GB | Offer Type: Without Kindle Unlimited,True,"Why I bought the Scribe: I am a college student, and I wanted something minimalist to take class notes/do math on that wasn't an Apple product. I'm a STEM student drawing a lot of Lewis structures and working complicated equations, and I used an entire 120 page notebook for one class within 8 weeks. I also am a huge reader and likely would've invested in a Kindle eventually, so this worked out well. As of writing this review, I have had the tablet for about a month, and to be completely honest, the only reason I could really afford the Scribe was because I have gotten a significant amount of excess scholarship aid-thank you to my state for buying me this tablet ;). Therefore, I am likely a little biased into really liking it, because I don't want it to be a waste of my scholarship money.What do I like about the Scribe?Overall, I have fallen in love with this tablet. Structurally, I like the size for writing (it's pretty close to an actual notebook page) and weight for my backpack, since I am carrying it around all day along with my laptop and rest of my gear. I absolutely LOVE the paper feel of the screen, the variety of notebook templates, and especially the eye comfort as compared to the bright blue light of a laptop or other tablet. I haven't had any problems with the (premium) pen itself, and the tips are easy to change. I also really like that if you have the mobile Kindle app on your phone, you can view the notebooks you've worked on.I have mostly used the Scribe for notes, lists, and marking up PDFs (I'm not much of an artist). I have had no problems with sending PDFs back and forth from the tablet to my laptop for the most part. That was also why I went for the 32 GB tablet; I send PDFs for about every class along with some personal stuff, and it's going to add up over time.What issues have I had?The most annoying issue I have had (at least, with my specific Scribe) is that there seems to be spots on the screen where the pen acts weird. I will be writing and the letters suddenly don't match on screen where I was writing or they will be super wide or super narrow (it is hard to describe in writing). They're almost in perfect circles, and there are at least three spots I can think of. They aren't on the edges, either, they are in the middle of the page, which is irritating when I'm writing in lines. It is also an issue that is just noticeable enough to be annoying but not so much that I would send the tablet back to get a new one. I have tried changing tips, and it is definitely the screen, not the pen. I've been learning to adapt to them, but definitely super frustrating when the Scribe costs this much.The second issue I've had is that it likes to drop WiFi, especially when I am on campus and moving building-to-building, or even room-to-room, which is incredibly frustrating when I am trying to send PDFs to my laptop. I have a lab and classes where I have to provide proof of calculations and notes, so having that capability is vital for me.Improvements I would Make to the Scribe and My Tips for Use:**Disclaimer: I am not a programmer, nor am I studying to become one. If I don't know the technical terms for things, please forgive me.**1. Improve the screen or software so that the ""circles"" of pen-weirdness end (I'm not entirely sure which would affect it).2. All the other reviews who say to get a third-party case? Heed them if you buy this tablet. I got the Gray Forest MoKo Case for 10.2"" Amazon Kindle Scribe, and I love it. It keeps the tablet in VERY securely (like, there's stitching on one side for the corners and a velcro strap that wraps around the ""spine"" of the Scribe) and bonus, it's absolutely gorgeous.3. It would be awesome to be able import JPGs or PNGs into notebooks in order to add to the note-taking experience. Maybe that defeats the purpose of minimalism, I don't know, but right now I'm sending OneNote files or just marking up PDFs that have the images in them. I'll be excited when the full Microsoft suite will be able to be imported in and marked up.4. Also in notebooks, it would be really handy to be able to select a section of text (like, draw a textbox kind of thing or highlight) and then move it to another part of the page or another page in the notebook. I don't know how many times I've had to copy what I've written on the same page before erasing the original text, which seems like too much labor for something so simple.5. Being able to put notebooks and PDFs in the same Collections or folders! I have a Collection for each class and then a Notebook folder for each class, and it would be really nice to have everything in one place.Whew. I think I covered everything. I might come back and edit my review once the developers have made more updates/changes. As of now I am happy with the product, besides the couple of issues, and I would absolutely buy it again. I've even had iPad users jealous of its simplicity, which feels like a weird flex ;). Way to go Kindle!",5 people found this helpful
"Introducing Kindle Scribe (16 GB), the first Kindle for reading and writing, with a 10.2‚Äù 300 ppi Paperwhite display, includes Basic Pen",4.0,Current Kindle Users Will Love It,"Reviewed in the United States üá∫üá∏ on January 16, 2023",Option: Premium Pen | Setup: 64 GB | Offer Type: Without Kindle Unlimited,True,"I'll start out by saying that I've been a Kindle user for years.  I started with a Paperwhite (2016), then upgraded to an Oasis (2019), and eagerly purchased the Scribe when it first came out.  I've been using it for about a month and in some ways, it's great.  In other ways, it needs a bit more work.  Lastly, I'll comment on the Amazon leather cover that I purchased.Size & Dimensions:First, this thing is huge compared to any other Kindle.  Seriously- look up the dimensions- then grab a ruler and draw it on a piece of paper.  Be sure that you are comfortable with the size (and weight) before you buy.  It's pretty easy to use this if you are sitting down at a desk, sitting in a chair, or something like that.  Reading in bed is a bit much.  Luckily, I kept my 2019 Kindle Oasis and I use my Scribe for everything other than reading before bed.  My Oasis is a lot easier to read while laying down.The Basics: Reading:This thing is just about perfect in terms of the essentials of what an e-reader needs.  The touchscreen works well when you want to turn a page, there's the same annoying second delay (as with all Kindles) when you click on a word that you want defined, and the automatic brightness and color adjustments work just as well on the Scribe as they worked on my 2019 Oasis... which is nice.  The one thing that I miss from my Oasis is the physical page turn buttons on the side.  Even after a month of reading on a daily basis, I still wish that Kindle had included those physical buttons like they did on the 2019 Oasis.  The screen is crystal clear and offers lots of different options for text (font, size, boldness).  It's pretty easy to find something that's going to be comfortable to read.The Writing:Okay- I'll give Kindle a bit of grace here because it is their first try and the whole writing thing.  The system that they came up with works, but it lacks polish.  Navigating the menu to get to the Notebook and specific document/files is a bit archaic and slow.  Transferring things from the Kindle to other devices/a computer is also pretty archaic.  There's also some annoyances that exist- for example- you have to be connected to your wifi in order to delete files.  My Scribe came with the ""premium"" pen... which I will admit- is very nice.  While I think that it's ridiculous to charge so much more for the premium pen in the lower models... you'll probably kick yourself and regret it if you don't get the premium pen.  The erasing function works well- and the side button has a few (emphasis on FEW) functions that make it useful.  Also- be sure that you don't lose that pen- as it costs A LOT to replace.  The magnet that holds the pen to the side of the Scribe is pretty strong- so hopefully you won't lose the pen.Navigating the Menus:This is where I subtracted one star.  I've been using my Scribe for about a month- and on three separate occasions, switching from reading to writing via the menu confused the device and it froze.  I had to restart it to get it to start working again.  Again, I gave Kindle some grace with this and only subtracted one star- as I hope that they will release an update that will solve this freeze/crash error.  Even without that issue- navigating the menu between reading and writing is pretty slow for a modern device at this price point.  Other parts of the menu are the exact same as on other Kindle e-readers- no better and no worse.  Generally I don't like the home screen on any Kindle and never really browse the Kindle Store on the device itself.  I instead use my laptop and just send whatever I want to the device.One feature I love:I love that as long as you are on wifi, your Kindles can be set to remember where you are in a particular book.  So if I'm reading on the couch with my Scribe and want to go to bed, I can turn off the Scribe, walk to the bedroom, and pick up my 2019 Oasis.  When I open my Oasis, the first thing it asks me is I want to pick up where I left in my book on my other Kindle.  The next day, when I grab my Scribe again- it does the same thing- and picks up right where I left off on the Oasis the night before.  The only catch- you have to do this while the devices are on your wifi.  If I take the Scribe to work and then open it on my lunch break- it won't be able to tell where I left off.Would I buy it again?I would certainly buy the Scribe again- but I read a lot- and I tend to carry this everywhere and use the notebook feature for keeping lists organized at work.  The price seems a bit too steep- but for someone who generally uses an e-reader on a daily basis, I think it's worth it.  They should include the premium pen though at this price point- regardless of if you get the 16/32/64gb model.The Case:I can't stress this enough.  Do not buy the Amazon-branded leather case for this.  It is an absolutely horrible design and it is very overpriced for what you get.  The Amazon cases are attached to the Scribe using pretty weak magnets that aren't that secure- and the device detaches from the case very easily.  Worse, without the case, the Scribe seems like it would be extremely vulnerable to damage if dropped from even a small height.  Worse, unlike most other Kindle cases/covers that open like a book- this one folds over the top.  As you try to do this, often the case becomes loose.  In addition, the pen holder holds that pen tightly for a few days- then starts to stretch a bit and the pen tends to fall out.  Given how much Amazon charges for a replacement pen, that's not a very good design.  Lastly, the quality of the leather simply does not match the price that Amazon is charging.I'll be looking for a third-party cover.",58 people found this helpful
"Introducing Kindle Scribe (16 GB), the first Kindle for reading and writing, with a 10.2‚Äù 300 ppi Paperwhite display, includes Basic Pen",5.0,might very well be the best choice among the currently available large e-readers,"Reviewed in the United States üá∫üá∏ on January 7, 2023",Option: Basic Pen | Setup: 16 GB | Offer Type: Without Kindle Unlimited,True,"I have a Kobo Forma (8 inch) which started to drain its battery faster than I'd like it to and the Scribe is bought as a replacement of sort.My plan is to use it for reading purposes only and I got the basic version to save on the cost.Other options seriously considered, together with reasons for not purchasing, are listed below:Kobo Forma: no longer availableKobo Sage: many users complained about its poor battery life and buggy software in reviewsKobo Libra 2: smaller (7 inch), issues with channel (Walmart has no stock, 3rd party (but seemingly semi-official) resellers like blueproton are asking for prices over Kobo's MSRP)First impressions on the Scribe:1. No ""special offers"" (Ads) for the basic version. If you got one from the earlier batches like the one I received, you can tell by looking closely at the box that Ads were part of the plan. Removal of the Ads combined with an array of other offers make the basic Scribe a relatively good value among the larger e-readers. For comparison, the Kobo Elipsa (10 inch) retails for $400 and is on paper weaker for reading due to its lower PPI and lack of warm light, and the kobo Sage (8 inch) retails for $260 (blueproton might have jacked up the price to $270 now) and doesn't even include a pen.2. Hardware seems well made. The gap around the screen has a uniform width as far as I can tell. Works with some 3rd party pens/stylus as well, such as Samsung's s-pen.3. Software throws errors during downloading from my Kindle library and making WIFI connections, but works in general with a retry or two. Not polished but no issues that block basic functionalities as an e-reader either. A retry or two in a full day's usage, esp. during the out of the box setup which also includes an OTA, can be described as a relatively smooth experience IMO when compared with the others in the e-reader field.Compared to the Forma:1. The Scribe's screen is noticeably larger. Less page turns for text even with its larger margins around the edges, and some PDFs are more readable as well. Ideally, you still want an A4 (13.3 inch 4:3) e-reader such as the Fujitsu ones for papers/books meant to be printed in that size, but those are quite limiting otherwise as an e-reader (PDF only, no front light) and the price is about $800 unless you choose to take the risks of importing one yourself.2. Without the front light on, the Forma has slightly deeper blacks and thus better subjective contrast than the Scribe. This is noticeable for both text and large swaths of colors on book covers. Text on the Scribe is still sharp and legible, just not as contrasty as on the Forma. I read that the newer Kobos such as the Libra 2 might be even better in this regard.3. The Scribe is way faster at highlighting words, the Forma is so slow that I'd be constantly second guessing myself like ""did my inputs register and it just needs another 5 seconds or should I try to touch it again?"". The Scribe on the other hand responds in a split of a second. Being able to use a pen/stylus also helps with precision. Navigating around the UI also feels smoother on the Scribe.4. The Forma is by no means small but still manageable using a single hand. Because it is light and has physical buttons. Scribe is a large tablet that I believe that most people would need some other support besides a single hand to use effectively and safely (not fun to have a heavy tablet fall onto your face while reading in the bed).5. The Forma has a tighter build, no visible gap around the screen and the plastic backside is not as slippery. That said, both the Forma and the Scribe are only IPX8.6. The Forma is more tweak-able. Simple example: the Forma has 2 timeout settings for sleep (quick wake up, 1 second or so) and off (10 seconds wake up), and both can be disabled. Scribe has no such settings even though it probably has multiple levels of sleep as well and will enter a deeper level after a longer timeout. The lack of configuration or even visibility says a lot about the difference in philosophies. As in, a simple device to read on or a toy to have fun fiddling with.7. Amazon's customer service is leaps and bounds better than Kobo's. Amazon's CSR are generally knowledgeable, capable of resolving issues and willing to help out, which is becoming increasingly rare in the US nowadays. Kobo's CSR on the other hand would claim that all Kobo e-readers are manufactured in Canada. This clearly shows that the person has neither seen a Kobo or its box, nor received adequate training on basic facts about the product that they are supposed to provide service for. It's not hard to imagine how hard the battle would be if I were to need any post-sale service from them.Summary:While there's no perfect large (8 inch or larger) e-reader available right now, the Scribe is a very strong contender among the offerings.With good hardware, good service and the basic one representing a good value, this might very well be the best choice among the currently available large e-readers.",18 people found this helpful
"Introducing Kindle Scribe (16 GB), the first Kindle for reading and writing, with a 10.2‚Äù 300 ppi Paperwhite display, includes Basic Pen",5.0,"Near textbook-sized display, fantastic refresh rate...","Reviewed in the United States üá∫üá∏ on December 5, 2022",Option: Premium Pen | Setup: 64 GB | Offer Type: Without Kindle Unlimited,True,"In short, the Kindle Scribe is just about everything that I wanted it to be, plus a little more. It's a beautiful device, thin as can be, and let's be honest, an aluminum back just feels good in the hand, especially when complemented by a flat-front glass screen. Further, even though the stylus looks like an all-plastic number, it is surprisingly hefty in hand without being taxingly heavy. Add in the USB-C plug and the single, elegant standby button and you have an attractive device. Is the Scribe a compromise? Sure! But nothing on the market is perfect, and this is as close as I've seen to Valhalla thus-far...It may surprise you to hear that this is my first Kindle. As an avid reader on the go, but someone in need of some cost-savings on multiple devices, I have opted for a slightly more expensive Android or Chrome OS tablet solution for reading in the past. Not only has this proven a frustrating experience given Android's track record with screens larger than 6"", it has also invited time-suck, as tablets are closer to production devices than one wants a true reading appliance to be. I was always seduced by the ability to take notes, from scribbles using dumb touch-pens in the dim past to a more complaint USI experience on newer devices.While the writing situation has become more... adequate on newer tablets, it's not enjoyable as the screen coatings are more about visibility than non-slip-ability. Furthermore, I have wanted a device solely for notes and reading for some time, my principal criteria being that: A) Said device should have fast refresh. B) it should be large enough to view textbook-sized pages. C) The screen should be clear enough to show small type without taxing my poor eyesight. D) Written notes should be simple to create, and feel effortless in the making. The Scribe ticks all those boxes.Let's address point D first. Whatever the coating on this glass screen is, it's got a lovely texture. It feels almost like writing on really good, bonded paper with an extremely sharp pencil. Refresh is fast enough that you can pretty much watch the lines draw as fast as you write on the screen. Erasing takes a tiny bit of getting used to with the included pen, as you have to press hard enough to ""activate"" the function on the upgraded stylus. However, the capture is flawless, and there's no worry about palm rejection unless you're accidentally flipping pages in your notebook. Overall, not the worst problem to have. I don't think there's much to improve here, unless it's easy access to the memos from some sort of Amazon drive. Nobody likes emailing another copy to themselves for something as small as a save update.Moving on, this tablet is big. It's not the biggest on the market, but it definitely has resolution cornered for its' size. At 300 dpi, text is razor sharp, and the greyscale is more than good enough to read digitized comics as well as displaying the .pdf's of my roleplaying books. Though .pdf's are a little more memory intensive for page-flips, the search functions work well, so the books are still quite usable. I was even able to port over through ""send to Kindle"" all my non-DRM books quite easily... While I can see how this would cause some users angst, I knew what I was buying into... A non-distracting device. I'm OK with a little compromise, though the process could be easier (aka, better limit than 200 MB?). I've heard one can side-load if they need to, but haven't yet tried myself.For reading, the Scribe is great. The page flips in Kindle books are fast enough, and even navigating through the library isn't terrible. Settings are a breeze, but I get complaints about waiting from other reviewers. This is not an Android tablet, and that is a fact I'm comfortable with. A lot of thought went into this device, especially considering unobtrusive back-lighting. Though you can read in full sunlight, I find that the backlights make text pop in almost all situations, and changes to lighting are fast. I can walk from my kitchen into my living room, down the hallway to the bedroom, and note the backlight changing intensities immediately as soon as lighting conditions change. I am also in love with the ""nightlight"" feature, which gradually turns down brightness after your eyes have adjusted. I'm an unapologetic night reader, and this made taking the tablet to bed a less jarring experience than reading off my cellphone. From an ergonomics perspective, all I can fault is that this is a one pound device, and though it has a nice one-handed grip, it's a little too heavy for hours of reading. My cover comes in a couple weeks, and I tend to be able to read out of my lap or off a table in public. I love the overall feel of the device, but maybe a ridge like the one baked into the Oasis would have been a good idea?The one thing I really don't like, and this is a slightly sour issue for me, since I am fairly invested in Google Play Books, is that Amazon doesn't support Adobe encryption for EPUB. Now, I get that both Google and Amazon want their own walled gardens. I know they aren't terribly invested in making sure access is easy for people paid into another ecosystem... And to that I say neither company is Apple, nor do they make their products so design and use-case perfect that they should be able to expect to be treated in a fawning way. So, program to play nice. There is no reason why it should be hard to register the S/N off a Kindle for easy use with Adobe DRM. If nothing else, it would encourage people who have bought tablets that they loathe using otherwise to instead pay into a more accommodating ecosystem and feel good about it. Oh, also? Google doesn't make an e-ink reader. Be the bigger tech company, and make bank because of it!",52 people found this helpful
"Introducing Kindle Scribe (16 GB), the first Kindle for reading and writing, with a 10.2‚Äù 300 ppi Paperwhite display, includes Basic Pen",5.0,Perfect for my needs.,"Reviewed in the United States üá∫üá∏ on December 16, 2022",Option: Basic Pen | Setup: 16 GB | Offer Type: Without Kindle Unlimited,True,"I have been wanting a bigger screen kindle since the slow death of the DX. I love reading, I read and listen to between 50 and 100 books a year. The screen on the scribe is terrific, better than the competitors I've seen, I love the e-ink screen. It's also, and this is crucial as it is part of my profession, PERFECT size for textbooks.I write on paper quite a bit. But, I also have a surface I've been taking to meetings and the like. It's heavy, and I have to keep it charged. Then, I lost my pen and the university I work for said they couldn't purchase me a new one. They could, however, purchase a new surface, which, well, is the idiocy of bureaucracy. So, in protest, I went back to the ubiquitous yellow legal pads.My note taking is rudimentary, I am not a digital artist, I have a huge kindle library, and I like the bigger screen to read from. This is probably who the Scribe is made for.The writing experience is great. It has a tactile feel, a bit like that you get from the surface pro pen 2, or, you know, actual paper, but, you never have to charge the pen. It also has the digital eraser on the pen, just flip it over and rub away (heh). The premium pen has a button that is set out-of-the-box as the highlighter button. There is no lag in the writing, if there is, I can't tell. It feels goooooooood, and looks good.There are some things you won't get. You won't get any kind of compatibility with note-taking apps, but, you can quickly send your note or whole notebook to your email as a pdf. If you want to use that pdf with your note taking apps or the like on your tablet, it's really straightforward. I imagine this is something that Amazon will add at a later date.Very important was the ability to mark-up pdfs. I do a lot of writing and research, and look at a lot of pdfs. I usually print them out and mark them up, because I care more about my comfort than trees. I don't have to do that, now. For ebooks and the like, you have a sticky note feature, which opens a box for you to write a note and then the box closes, like adding a comment in Word.For the peer-reviewed papers I download, I make sure they are in pdf and then just send them to my kindle using email. It isn't hard, and anyone making it out to be is missing something completely, like how to use email. Compose a new email, drag your pdfs to it, send it to your kindle email. On the pc, and I think the kindle app now, too, you can just drag and drop on amazon, too. It is painless.Once the pdfs are on my kindle, I can mark them up as if I'm writing on the pages, just like the notebook feature. So, this has been worth it to me. Load it up with pdfs, I'm able to read through them and mark them up, send them back to myself through email if I want.So, for me, this is great. I also got the discount for trading in my old kindle, so the price point was very reasonable. I don't need flashy. I don't need colors or brushes to paint with. I just needed something I could use to mark up pdfs and read my kindle books, and not have to charge EVERY DAY. Probably won't have to charge it every week. The battery life is magnificent. Ill say that again....The battery life is magnificent.I've used it for 5 hours straight, including using the notebook a lot, and I've lost 2% of the battery.I'll leave it to others to complain about the price, or the writing not having enough features, or whatever else they want to complain about. I do not use the kindle to surf the web, because I have a computer, a tablet, and a phone, and I do not need to use it as a digital artist. My doodles are pretty impressive, but that's the most I need to get out of it.1) I don't have to jack around with books, kindle has the best access and the best library and I want it to be easy and 2) I can mark my stuff up without having to charge my pen or my tablet.That's all I need and this Kindle has delivered.Edit: I see reviews about the little notebook tool bar thing hanging out on the margin of your page, including a picture with it circled. It's pretty easy to hide, click those three buttons at the top and HIDE  THE TOOLBAR. Not rocket surgery at all. There are a lot of reviews complaining about features that they don't understand, or complaining about something not being a feature....when it actually is. So, do your research before believing any reviews, mine included. It's a lot of money to spend or not spend based on the opinion of people who may not use it like you would want to or who are complete morons who can't figure out how to use it.",21 people found this helpful
"Introducing Kindle Scribe (16 GB), the first Kindle for reading and writing, with a 10.2‚Äù 300 ppi Paperwhite display, includes Basic Pen",4.0,Feature based review,"Reviewed in the United States üá∫üá∏ on February 5, 2023",Option: Premium Pen | Setup: 64 GB | Offer Type: Without Kindle Unlimited,True,"This review is a bit long and is feature focused rather than being focused on how I use it or if it‚Äôs a good value (only you can decide that). Having said that, for what I want to use if for it‚Äôs fantastic and I love it but carefully consider the features and being an early adopter of the scribe ecosystem. Review is based off of the 64Gb model with a premium pen and leather case.Summary:For what it does 4.5/5.0: It does fail in some capabilities (e.g. buggy) but for it actually does it‚Äôs good.For what it says it does 3.0/5.0: It doesn‚Äôt live up to the hype, yet. Most of that is software and hopefully will be addressed.Overall: Unmatched writing experience but very rough and limited software and feature set. Hopefully that will be addressed soon, but there is no guarantee.Details:Display: Very good, it‚Äôs a paper white display which means low power and long battery life, and great visibility in strong lighting conditions. As a Kindle e-reader it‚Äôs unmatched.Writing: This is where the device really shines, the writing experience is as close to pen on paper as I‚Äôve seen in a tablet device. The positioning is accurate, the lag is not really noticeable, and there is a slight scratch reminiscent of a fountain pen on paper.Pen: The premium pen is very ergonomic with an eraser tip, and a programmable button that can be set to switch to highlighter, pen, eraser or pop up a sticky not. It‚Äôs very lightweight and easy to handle. The pen magnetically clips to the side of the Scribe but is not very secure. The Amazon cases have a sleeve that securely holds the pen at the bottom of the case and are recommended to keep it attached when carrying the Scribe in a bag or pack.Annotating: Basically in the form of electronic sticky notes. If graphical they are fixed size (like a sticky note) and then show up as an icon in the book. Once one is opened you can get to an option to see all, but navigating them is simply scrolling through screens, not very useful with a lot of annotations. Typed text annotations can be much longer. Not a strong capability in relation to something that allows actual annotations on the books.Organizing a notebook: Very limited, basically you can add a page to the end or delete a page. You can‚Äôt insert one, nor can you reorder the pages. Navigating a notebook is just browsing through it, you can‚Äôt skip to a page or to the end.Organizing notebooks: You can switch the views to show by title, most recent, etc., but no custom sorting. Folders can be created but not nested. Combined with the lack of ability to create complex notebooks (meaning more small notebooks) this can be limiting to organizing everything. You do have the option of not having a notebook on the device (removed download) which leaves it solely in the cloud, and the visible notebooks can be filtered to only show downloaded ones.Cloud Storage and Synchronization: Notebooks are synchronized to the cloud and stored by Amazon much like a book you would buy from them. This only functions with Amazons cloud storage so you are tied to Amazon. Like any service while it is free now they may decide to limit, discontinue, or charge for this service. Changes do not always sync up to the cloud, in particular changes made when not connected to Wi-Fi. Once connected to Wi-Fi if you make a change the notebook will sync but if you do significant work offline it‚Äôs something to keep in mind till they get the kinks of the synchronization capability. You can work around it by touching every notebook you‚Äôve done offline work in once connected back up, but that can be cumbersome.Templates: A number of basic templates are provided but there is no way to really create your own templates. Templates can only be applied to the whole notebook and not to individual pages.Importing notebooks: Not really an option at this point.Exporting notebooks: Notebooks can be shared via email. Sharing will cause the notebook to be rendered to a normal PDF in the cloud and an email sent with a link. This works well and always seems to get the latest modifications to the notebook. Note that this is not a capability of the device, but is a cloud service provided by Amazon and they may change, remove or charge for it in the future. This also has to be done on a notebook by notebook basis, there is no way to bulk render notebooks for backup or archive storage.OCR or Writing to Text: No capability whatsoever.Bookmarks and Linking: No bookmark, table of contents, or linking (within or to other notebooks) is available. This is a big miss within notebooks.Case: None is provided but highly recommended for the protection of the screen and holding the pen. I have the leather case and the fit and finish are very good.",6 people found this helpful
"Introducing Kindle Scribe (16 GB), the first Kindle for reading and writing, with a 10.2‚Äù 300 ppi Paperwhite display, includes Basic Pen",4.0,It's good now and it's going to be an excellent tool with some updates to the firmware.,"Reviewed in the United States üá∫üá∏ on December 20, 2022",Option: Premium Pen | Setup: 32 GB | Offer Type: Without Kindle Unlimited,True,"I bought this product primarily for: reading professional documents and writing notes for work.  I also own a ReMarkable 2. In the end, I gave the ReMarkable 2 to my son to use.  Here's what I preferred about the Kindle Scribe.Biggest pros to the Scribe:1. the backlight.  The Scribe backlight is a huge win for reading and for writing in low light.2. The gyroscope that allows me to flip it upside down. I'm left-handed and I really like being able to reverse the orientation sometimes.Biggest cons:1. The Scribe premium pen sucks compared to the ReMarkable 2 premium pen.  So much so that I gave my son the Scribe pen and kept my ReMarkable pen. The ReMarkable pen is 4 g heavier BUT (huge but!) it's correctly weighted so it's not tiring to hold.  Also the eraser on the Scribe pen is far too slippery.  If you're going to buy one, skip the pen and buy yourself a ReMarkable premium pen. It costs more than twice as much but it's so worth it.  We ended up sanding the end of the Scribe Premium Pen eraser with fine sandpaper just to give it a more grippy feel.  My son (who has bigger, meatier hands than I do) did not mind the poor balance of the pen. It made my hand cramp. I really couldn't use it for long and this would have been a reason to return the device if I hadn't already owned a ReMarkable 2 pen.2. No integration with Google Drive, or Dropbox. It's kludgy to have to email yourself every document you want.  On the other hand, the ReMarkable 2 integration with Gdrive is not all that wonderful, so I'm not finding it too awfully painful. The Scribe accepts Word document format - and turns it into very clear Kindle ebook format - however the original pagination is lost which can be a bit confusing if you remembered you were trying to edit p. 57.Smaller pros and consPros:The Scribe has slightly better screen resolution than the ReMarkable 2.I've had a Kindle for umpty-ump years (18? 19?) so the basic interface is really, really familiar to me, which helped me get up and running fast.ConsAt present there is just one pen nib. Amazon is promising more in the coming months and I hope they deliver. ReMarkable 2 has a lot and they are really wonderful for annotating or dashing off a quick sketch of an idea. The ReMarkable 2 pen pressure sensor recognizes 4096 levels, and they have really made good use of that to provide naturalistic writing styles (calligraphy pen, markers, etc). According to discussion I have read, the Scribe apparently only recognizes ""on"" or ""off"", so it's never going to be as good. However, the ReMarkable 2 has other features that the Scribe would do well to emulate, such as allowing you to highlight or draw in ""color"" - only seen in grayscale on the device, but fully visible when you export your document as a PDF.  That's a really nice option.The face of the screen is a little bit more slippery than that of the ReMarkable 2, which took me a while to get used to when writing.  But I did get used to it.The device is some 43 g heavier (3 pens worth) than the ReMarkable. I didn't find this made much difference to me.  It's not as elegant, either.If you send your Word document as a Word document and don't save it as a to PDF, you can't scribble directly on it. Although, the conversion to an Amazon epub _does_ save all the comments that pre-exist conversion, as footnotes with a gray background - which was better than ReMarkable, which just suppressed them.ReMarkable offers to email your notes in a script-to-text format and if you use some formatting tricks, you can get lists, columns, etc.  I struggled with the fancy formatting (never got the hang of it) but the basic script-to-text was a really handy export mechanism - say, for example, you take meeting notes and you want to email them to participants quickly at the end.The cloud integration and desktop app that ReMarkable 2 offer mean you can open a PDF, have people sign it, for example, and then pull it back on your computer really easily. Again, with the Kindle Scribe, you have to resort to emailing it out (and what you get is an AWS link that's only good for 7 days). Again, it's a bit kludgy.I also had trouble getting Powerpoint slides to display in landscape mode. I had to save them as a PDF, open them in a PDF reader on my computer, select all, rotate them 90 degrees, save the file again, and then email them to myself for it to display correctly rotated. Apparently the rotation feature (under the font selection menu) only works for epubs?***TL;DR All that said, I liked (loved) the Scribe backlight, the ability to flip it head-to-foot, and the fact that it was, after all, a Kindle and thus I found it easy to understand how to set it up and use it. I haven't downloaded a single book to this device but I've emailed myself about 100 PDFs, made 3 notebooks, and helped my son graph logarithms on it.I am eagerly awaiting the software upgrades - the basic hardware seems solid, so kudos to Amazon for coming out with the Scribe, and further kudos for their plans to upgrade the writing tools.",39 people found this helpful
"Introducing Kindle Scribe (16 GB), the first Kindle for reading and writing, with a 10.2‚Äù 300 ppi Paperwhite display, includes Basic Pen",5.0,Great product that delivers all that was promised! A truly satisfying experience.,"Reviewed in the United States üá∫üá∏ on November 30, 2022",Option: Premium Pen | Setup: 32 GB | Offer Type: Without Kindle Unlimited,True,"*WARNING* I've seen several reviews that are knocking the product because they think it is unnecessary or is lacking some features that Amazon made clear up front would not be available at launch. I feel that is unfair. Overall, this is a quality-built product that embodies all of the great features we love about Kindle, while adding a beautiful note-taking capability. I purchased this product out of my own pocket and this is my unbiased review of the product. If you're still curiou, read on.I have always loved the Amazon Kindle. When I heard about the release of the Scribe, I pre-ordered mine right way, and it even arrived a day earlier than the release date! From a Kindle perspective, it embodies all of the great features Kindle-users have grown to love. It has a big, back-lit glare free screen, which is beautiful for reading. The size, weight and layout is similar to the Oasis and it has a premium quality build and feel to it. The back is a smooth metal and it feels very sturdy in-hand. The battery life seems extraordinary, as is the case with most Kindle products. Mine has been in standby mode with the screen illuminated with a book cover for over 12 hours and remains at 100% charge.They call it the Scribe because users have the ability to write in it as well. Due to copyright issues I'm sure, you can't exactly write on the pages of the book, but you do have the ability to create hand-written notes similar to a sticky-note, which you can access in multiple ways for review. What is cool, is that Amazon includes a ""notebook"" feature that allows you to create notes or drawings that are separate from the Library/reading portion of the Scribe. The notebook is accessible from the home screen. You have the option for various page styles (i.e. wide-ruled, college-ruled, blank, etc.). In conjunction with the included stylus pen, this is where the Scribe really shines! The note taking capability is phenomenal. It does feel like writing with a pen on a piece of paper. Note-taking is smooth and seamless. The stylus has virtually no delay and was truly a satisfying experience. The fact that I can carry this around with me and use it to take hand-written notes, while still having access to my full Kindle library is awesome. I have the Amazon Fire HD 10 Plus tablet, and regardless of the stylus pen or note-taking app chosen, have not had nearly as satisfying of an experience writing and taking notes.Now let's talk about the stylus pen itself. There are two versions. I opted for the Premium Pen, which includes an eraser on the top of the pen as well as a programmable shortcut button. The pen is battery free, so you never have to worry about charging it. It feels good in the hand and as already stated, writes phenomenally. I did find that the positioning of the shortcut button on the Premium Pen is a little unfortunate. If your hand favors a lower grip on the pen when writing, the tendency will be to bump the button. Depending on what feature you have programmed as the shortcut (i.e. highlighter for example), it could become a nuisance. I would have preferred to see it a little higher up on the shaft of the pen. Outside of that, the fact that you can switch between pen mode and highlighter with the click of a button is super convenient. The eraser works well, though there is a slight delay between erasing something and it disappearing on the screen. I also found that when using a lined paper notebook for notetaking, the eraser seemed to eliminate the lines along with what I was erasing. Perhaps that will be fixed in a software update. Keep in mind that there is also an ""undo"" button onscreen that would be better utilized than the eraser for quick eliminations. Overall, the Premium Pen is nice, but probably not necessary. There are enough built-in features on screen to accomplish the same functions, albeit probably not quite as quickly.One of the biggest questions I had about the Scribe was going to be whether or not it would accommodate left-handed users. Most of the pictures and videos show the Scribe being used by right-handed people, i.e. the unutilized portion of the screen where you hold it is on the left side. Thankfully, like most tablets and phones these days, the Scribe has a built-in gyroscope, so simply rotating the device allows the screen to reorient into the proper position. This means I can hold it with my right hand and write with my left hand without issue. This may be a feature that the newer version of the Kindle possess, but my experience has been with the older version of the paperwhite, which did not have this ability.Final thoughts. If you love the Kindle and you're looking for something you can read on and take notes, then this is the device for you. Can you accomplish the same thing from a tablet? Yes. Higher end tablets like the iPad are definitely contenders, especially considering the price of the Scribe. That being said, if you don't need or want all of the apps and features that tablets offer, the Scribe is a great alternative. There are no distractions. No temptations. Just pure an uninterrupted reading and notetaking. It's a beautiful reading and writing experience that is only going to improve as Amazon improves its capabilities in the coming months. Remember, the Scribe has been on the market for a solid 24 hours at this point! While it is on the pricier side, Amazon is giving you 20% off with a trade-in of an older Kindle model. That's a pretty unbelievable deal considering the Scribe was just released (and the trade credit worked during pre-order too). Overall, I'm extremely satisfied with this product so far. Thanks Amazon for another amazing product!",72 people found this helpful
"Introducing Kindle Scribe (16 GB), the first Kindle for reading and writing, with a 10.2‚Äù 300 ppi Paperwhite display, includes Basic Pen",4.0,Game Changer for disorganized ADHD brain!,"Reviewed in the United States üá∫üá∏ on February 1, 2023",Option: Premium Pen | Setup: 16 GB | Offer Type: Without Kindle Unlimited,True,"I was diagnosed with ADHD about a year ago after struggling for most of my life. My counselor recommended starting a bullet journal to keep my life organized. I had loved the concept and ran with it for awhile. This page is my To-Do list, this page is a journal, this page is notes from last night's meeting, this page is a story I'm writing just for fun, this page is a doodle, etc. It was the kind of thing that seemed disorganized unless you were in my head. But... I couldn't find things easily when I had to refer back to them (despite making an index), and I tired of drawing the same templates every day in order to make my schedules.Enter the Kindle Scribe, which my husband suprised me with as a Christmas present. It has been a total game changer! It combines the tactile feeling of handwriting with the simplified organization of a computer. The writing experience is closer to paper than any other medium I have tried - it is even smoother than the Rocketbooks scannable and reusable notebooks that feel more like a whiteboard than paper. I can even use stencils! Can't find my notes from that meeting? It's in the folder for meeting notes, organized by date. And the templates: I created them on my computer, converted them to pdf, sent them to kindle, and voila! Instant reuseable template. The convenience of having all of my favorite books on hand on a much larger easier to read screen and the ability to write notes in it is such a bonus as well! The battery life is also amazing - I've been using it for a few hours at least five days a week, and I've only had to charge it three times since the initial charge on Christmas (it is Feb 1)!It is pretty awesome, but not perfect. Here is my wish list for future models and/or software updates:For future models: The pen, whether pro or otherwise, does not have a strong magnet and is easy to lose. I bought a 3rd-party case with an elastic strap to hold it, but I have already seen a lot of posts about the pen getting lost, so this is a serious design flaw. Also, The official case from the Kindle store is expensive and only holds the tablet with some magnets - not very secure. The 3rd-party case I purchased is better quality for half the price. Why?For future software updates: The notebook feature could use some additional features - you can't put folders within folders, you can't reorder pages within a notebook, you can't change templates within a notebook without changing the entire notebook, you can't create your own custom templates (unless you do my pdf work around), and there is no handwriting to text feature. None of these things are must-haves for me, but would make the experience even better!When taking notes in books, it would be nice to be actually able to write on the page itself (though I admit that the post-it-note type pop-up does give you more room to write). The only option for marking text is to highlight it. Occasionally, I'd like to be able to underline, circle, or star passages as well. And a few of my kindle books are workbooks with fill in the blanks and questions that need answered with lines begging you to write in them - and you can't. Again, this does not diminish my love for the tablet, but would greatly enhance it! (Note: I have several documents I need to read for work loaded onto the device as a pdf, and I can do all these things and more with those. Why not the official Kindle book?)Finally, all of the books, pdfs, and audiobooks all end up in the same place on the library tab which can make looking for a particular book or document difficult, and if you have a lot of pdfs like I do, it can be hard to find which document you need at a glance because there is no preview of the contents or cover page.In short, this is an amazing, though imperfect device. Keeping in mind that this is a first edition, I am blown away by the features that it does have! If you're ok with missing the features that I mentioned above and/or waiting for a software update to install them, BUY IT!",11 people found this helpful
"Introducing Kindle Scribe (16 GB), the first Kindle for reading and writing, with a 10.2‚Äù 300 ppi Paperwhite display, includes Basic Pen",4.0,The most exciting Kindle in years,"Reviewed in the United States üá∫üá∏ on January 24, 2023",Option: Basic Pen | Setup: 16 GB | Offer Type: Without Kindle Unlimited,True,"When this first came out, I was pretty sure I didn't want one: ""it is too large"" ""I don't need a notebook"" ""an iPad is a better value and it's more versatile"" ""I don't need to mark up PDF and Word documents"" ""I don't see the value of making handwritten notes for my Kindle books""...However, when it was marked down a couple of weeks ago, and I realized I could save even more by trading in a Kindle Oasis which I got a few months earlier, and did not like, I decided to get one.Of course it has the same reading features as any recent Kindle. The only difference for reading Kindle books is that you can create so-called Sticky Notes in addition to Notes typed in with Kindle's virtual keyboard.The biggest functional change is the Notebooks section, where you pretty much have to abandon typing (except for titles of the documents created there).My biggest surprise was how natural it feels to write with the Pen. I've had iPads with Pencil for several years, but while the Pencil is a flagship feature, and the handwriting recognition is pretty good, I've never felt comfortable writing with it (am trying some alternative tips, which helps somewhat). I've been jotting down ideas for some small software projects I want to undertake, and finding some traction in actually getting started with a couple of them. So while there may be additional features coming to Notebooks, I am not going to sit around waiting for them. It's good enough now to be useful to me.What I'm excited about are the changes to the Personal Documents service, which has been around for years, but which are finally getting an overhaul to support Word and PDF workflows. I'm not so interested in those in their own right, but already ePub and Word documents sent to the service look and feel like Kindle books (support 'enhanced typography' features).PDFs have been poorly supported: they are somewhat functional on Kindles, but the notes, annotations, reading position do not 'sync' to other Kindles and Kindle apps registered to your account. The annotations can only be pulled off a Kindle using My Clippings log file. In the Kindle apps, PDFs are virtually read-only; you cannot search, highlight, or set books marks.When the are sent to Scribe, however, they are converted to one of Kindle platform's fixed-layout formats, known as Print Replica. This is the format used for many textbooks and engineering books in Kindle Store, and previously Kindles could not read these.Currently the files converted from PDF are not fully functional: you cannot select and nightlight and search for text, for example. But if you take the file from the Scribe and side load it to the Kindle for iPad app, you can interact with the text just as you can with any Print Replica content from Kindle Store. So it is reasonable to assume there will be an update that will provide this expected functionality, and that Scribes will eventually be able to download Kindle Store content in this format. Conversely, these will sync with the Kindle apps for iOS and Android, and probably other Kindles.I do have some books in PDF format, but heretofore they have not been welcome on Kindle platform. When the Print Replica personal document support is rolled out, they will be.I'm not expecting all of this to happen in the next week or two, but hopefully within the next few months we'll have an update or two to fix the Print Replica issue and perhaps see it show up on another platform or two. And I'm hoping we see other Kindles and Kindle apps start seeing the 'enhanced' features with ePub and Word imports soon.If you require a true PDF or Word markup workflow, this is not the time to get a Scribe. Amazon hasn't give a lot of details about what this will look like. The current Share PDF does in fact return a PDF file, but it looks like a placeholder now. While I'm not the customer for this, Amazon needs to implement a more credible round trip if they want to succeed with customers who are looking for it.To summarize, I'm very happy I got one, it's much more than I thought it was,  and I am looking forward to what comes in the next update.",4 people found this helpful
"Introducing Kindle Scribe (16 GB), the first Kindle for reading and writing, with a 10.2‚Äù 300 ppi Paperwhite display, includes Basic Pen",5.0,an amazing e-reader + rudimentary writing capabilities,"Reviewed in the United States üá∫üá∏ on December 19, 2022",Option: Premium Pen | Setup: 32 GB | Offer Type: Without Kindle Unlimited,True,"1. It's an amazing e-reader=====================There's a few details that make this product the best big-screen e-reader on the market:- 10.2"" screen- 300 ppi (highest pixel density on the market for its size)- integrated front light with adjustable warmthThe big screen is invaluable for reading anything with technical diagrams:- PDFs- e-textbooks- e-books that have diagrams and picturesYou can use third-party services to send news articles and blog posts to the device, and they appear with images intact. Again, the big screen makes the images a lot easier to view than on any other Kindle. And the e-ink display is much more pleasant to view than a tablet, especially in the evening.Put all of this together, and you've got an unparalleled e-reader for reading just about anything: news articles, novels, textbooks, research papers, whatever you want. I personally love sending blogs and articles to my Scribe throughout the day and then reading them before bed.2. Very basic e-writing functionality============================This is a Kindle that you can write on, not much more. You can create ""notebooks"", which are documents with as many pages as you need, and you can group them into ""folders"", but without any nesting (no folders-within-folders).You've got some built-in templates for notes like lined paper, graph paper, and todo lists.The note-taking experience is very basic: you've got a pen with various widths, an eraser with various widths, and a highlighter. To compare, competitors will offer things like pressure-sensitivity and layers. Put simply: the Kindle Scribe is not competitive with respect to sketching. You can still jot down notes though.I still use the note-taking a lot. I keep it at my desk to jot down ideas to consider later. I keep it on my nightstand so I can write down any thoughts that occur to me before bed or if I wake up in the middle of the night.Getting documents off the Scribe could be a lot better though. Competitors have integration for upload various cloud services. It's within the realm of possibility for Amazon to offer these features on the Scribe as a software update, but I wouldn't hold your breath. I would take this device at face value: a great e-reader with some note-taking functionality that doesn't get you much further than having a pad of paper to jot down your ideas.3. Security & privacy================The best way to send documents to your Scribe is through Amazon's Send-to-Kindle feature. That way you don't have to fuss with cables. Also, it's the only way for you to get PDFs that you can write on - there must be some pre-processing done on Amazon's servers for this feature.What this means is that you should only send documents that you are comfortable sharing with strangers. I haven't been able to find a privacy policy regarding information sent with Send-to-Kindle. That means that you shouldn't be sending:- personal information like phone numbers, addresses, financial information- anything related to your work, this includes graded papersI personally have no problem sending news articles and blog posts from the open Internet. I understand this might give Amazon a picture of my interests. That's a sacrifice I'm willing to make.Another important note about security: you can password-protect this device, but it doesn't encrypt storage, which means that if your device is stolen, a thief could remove the storage, plug it into their computer, and read anything on your device.In other words, this device has the same security profile as a paper notebook. You should treat it as such. It's very likely that your employer would have a problem with you taking sensitive notes about your work on this device. They probably gave you a laptop with encrypted storage for this reason.4. Conclusion===========It's an amazing e-reader. Unparalleled at this screen size. I use it all the time to read technical documentation and news articles.The note-taking is very basic and in my opinion useful, but not great for anything besides jotting down your thoughts for later review. It's certainly not for sketching - there are much better alternatives for that.The privacy and security of this device are very limiting when it comes to business use. Students should have no problem, and I personally have no problem keeping shopping lists and the like on it. But there's nothing protecting your files if the device is stolen, and the Send-to-Kindle feature doesn't seem to ensure any level of privacy.",3 people found this helpful
"Introducing Kindle Scribe (16 GB), the first Kindle for reading and writing, with a 10.2‚Äù 300 ppi Paperwhite display, includes Basic Pen",5.0,Giant Kindle takes notes,"Reviewed in the United States üá∫üá∏ on January 14, 2023",Option: Premium Pen | Setup: 32 GB | Offer Type: Without Kindle Unlimited,True,"I‚Äôll skip covering the reading experience as it‚Äôs the same software experience on any other Kindle, just a larger screen. If you‚Äôve used one, you know what to expect and if not, it‚Äôs well documented elsewhere and Amazon has really got that aspect locked in. The large screen is quite nice for technical books with lots of diagrams that get squished even on an Oasis.TLDR: If you just want a large-screen Kindle and don‚Äôt care to write much or at all, the smallest storage is right for you and you can save some money on the pen and treat it as a stylus. If you want to write, consider the 32G with the premium pen as a starting point. Those sizes will also appeal to manga and comics lovers.Hardware: The device feels solid and fairly sturdy, but not heavy. The paperlike finish coats the whole front, not just the screen area. It‚Äôs subtle but feels nice. The back and sides are metal, like an iPad. The premium pen has a similar finish and is much lighter than an Apple Pencil, comparable to a real pen in size and weight. It makes a difference when you‚Äôre writing a lot. The actual writing experience feels so right in a way that‚Äôs hard to actually describe, but they really did nail it here. I‚Äôve tried using an iPad with a paperlike screen and Apple pencil and this is just far closer to a proper writing feel and experience. If you intend to write, absolutely get the premium pen so you can flip to erase instead of switching options in the menu. I wouldn‚Äôt have thought that would make a huge difference in experience, but it does. Notebooks take up a good chunk more space than a typical book, so I‚Äôd also strongly recommend the 32G or 64G variants if you plan on taking lots of notes.Software: The core note-taking experience is there, but some features are currently lacking, like selecting and moving written text around, or searching your writing, or converting to text, etc. You can‚Äôt add or remove pages easily nor can you do a deep folder structure, etc. I don‚Äôt feel these are dealbreakers for me, but they may be for you. I‚Äôm mainly using the notes for work to replace a yellow pad and pen, so it‚Äôs not like I had these features anyway, and the writing experience feels less effortless than using an iPad with GoodNotes, which has all those features, but it feels like maybe too much? Plus the iPad is a distraction machine. It‚Äôs hard to get offtrack with a Kindle Scribe, I open the notebook and‚Ä¶ just start writing. Nothing else to do with it but read. Notes in books and documents sent to Kindle are not as robust as you‚Äôd imagine, and your notes are roped into the Kindle ecosystem. I can see them in the app on my phone though, which is nice. I‚Äôm eager to see what Amazon can push out in this department, but the software for note taking is (still a very excellent but) minimal viable product right now (January 2023). Overall there are competitors that can do note taking with far more features in this space, so carefully consider what YOU need to make your note taking experience work and whether this device fits your needs today. Never buy anything based on features ‚Äúcoming soon.‚ÄùAccessories: Get the premium pen if you plan to write often. The pen can be used as a stylus too, which is nice. I went with the Amazon cover and have found the angle it folds up at is really nice for writing and viewing. It‚Äôs fairly sturdy, but the Scribe just attaches to the cover via moderately-strong magnets. It won‚Äôt fall off during writing or reading, but if you flipped it upside down the Scribe would fall out, so it would‚Äôve been nice to have it snap in to a plastic shell like the Oasis cover for better security. I‚Äôm not sure the thought process there honestly. Treat this device like it cost you a couple hundred bucks, I guess. I think the Scribe itself is robust enough, but I would like to see a more protective cover for travel, or folks with kids in the house.",2 people found this helpful
"Introducing Kindle Scribe (16 GB), the first Kindle for reading and writing, with a 10.2‚Äù 300 ppi Paperwhite display, includes Basic Pen",4.0,A great device - for specific users...,"Reviewed in the United States üá∫üá∏ on March 10, 2023",Option: Premium Pen | Setup: 64 GB | Offer Type: Without Kindle Unlimited,True,"This is probably the most in-depth review I've made for an Amazon order.  First, I absolutely love my Scribe. I was torn between this and the Remarkable 2 but decided to go with this because I'm also an avid reader with lots of Kindle books already...so that only made sense.So, as i mentioned in the title, this is a great little device for specific users.  If you do a lot of drawing/sketching or graphic arts stuff, the Scribe (with the latest update) may disappoint.  For heavy artistic stuff, I'd look more towards an iPad, MS Surface, etc.  However, if you read a lot and need something that provides a medium to take plenty of notes, the Scribe is excellent.  I take TONS of notes for work.  To the point that I keep my old spiral-bound notebooks in a drawer in my office with dates of when I started and finished them.  This method became unsustainable with lost notebooks during moves, pages torn out by kids cause they needed some ""scratch paper"", etc.  I've only had this thing for about 2 weeks but I've already put it through the wringer for note taking.Books are excellent as you would expect from a Kindle and I've found the battery life is pretty decent, although not quite as good as, say, my Paperwhite.However, if there are any people @Amazon reading this, there are some improvements I really wish it had; and hope/think they could be added with future updates:- Bluetooth keyboard support- Landscape mode in notebooks- Lasso copy and paste- Ability to change the template for individual pages within a notebook- Shapes (like squares, circles, etc.)- Select and copy images/text from PDFs or books into notebooks- Make highlights and written notes in books - I bought the book...I should be able to write in it if I want.- OCR handwriting to text conversion - especially when sending notes via email- Save PDFs to folders instead of having to store them in your library- Ability to move the writing tool other than the default left and right side.  I'd rather it be in a far upper right or lower left corner.  As it is, I have to alternate the tool position from left to right once I'm about 1/3 down the page.- Save individual pages of notebooks as a new notebook (for example, I start taking notes in a notebook and on the 5th page, I start taking notes from a phone conference that turns into something completely unrelated to the rest of the notebook.  It would be great if I could start a new notebook and choose existing pages of other notebooks to include in it.)A couple of bugs/weird things that I've noticed:- Sometimes, while writing a sentence, the last couple of letters will ""erase"" or just disappear.  I've figured out that tapping the eraser once on the screen makes it reappear again.  Not a huge deal, but is annoying cause it forces you to break concentration to correct it and restart.- Depending on where you place your hand when writing, you'll accidentally skip to a new page while writing.  As above, not a big deal, but annoying.  Maybe some setting to double-tap to start a new page or something would help.Anyway, overall, I think the Scribe is great for my needs and really look forward to what they can do with future software updates.",5 people found this helpful
"Introducing Kindle Scribe (16 GB), the first Kindle for reading and writing, with a 10.2‚Äù 300 ppi Paperwhite display, includes Basic Pen",5.0,Way better than the alternative for me,"Reviewed in the United States üá∫üá∏ on February 17, 2023",Option: Premium Pen | Setup: 32 GB | Offer Type: Without Kindle Unlimited,True,"I bought a Remarkable2 initially as a writing tablet. Downside was that was all it did, which was an upside, except that I could not import Kindle books to it - which was a downside. The other downsides were the price, and I had a software problem which they wouldn't even acknowledge much less fix, and the writing to text conversion was abysmal (this was supposed to be a strong point). I returned it under their generous 100 day policy at the 40 day mark for a full refund.Now, the Kindle. Traded my Oasis in for a $75 credit and got a 20% discount, so you have to love Amazon for that, whatever else you may not like about the company.On the reader, it is the superb Kindle experience on a screen larger that the old DX version, which is great for me and much better than the small Oasis and Paperwhite versions. Plus, backlit for in the dark reading, and one can read it outside in the sun, unlike a normal tablet. The making note via handwriting is much better that finger picking on a keyboard like the Oasis. Is is heavy? A bit, but honestly, as a 69 year old man with arthritis in my hands, I really don't have a problem with holding it by one hand when laying on my back and reading it in bed.It doesn't have page turn buttons like the Oasis, but I can't say that I miss them.On the writing tablet side of things. It functions quite well for my purposes as a retired male who doesn't need it for work or meeting or any such thing. One can import docs to the Kindle reader, which works quite well, though you cannot edit them there. There are not as many templates as the Remarkable offers, but that is not a real downside for me. Plus, the downsides of the Remarkable far outweigh its benefits, a least to me.The pen is easy to use, though the erase function is not quite a nice as the R2 - and I would recommend the premium version. It does not stay attached without fail to the device, but see my review on the Amazon cover which rectifies this. One small irritation about the premium pen is the location of the shortcut button, which makes it easy to activate and use by mistake unless you take the care to turn it away from your grasping finger when using the pen. The highlight function is nice, which the R2 doesn't have.The writing offers sufficient varieties of pen style and width to more than suit me, and the writing is seamless and works well - as well or better than the R2.I have not experienced one glitch while using, the screen does not resize randomly when I lay my hand on it like the R2 did and which they could not fix.All in all, I highly recommend the device!Update. The premium pen, while a plus on the eraser end, is a but irritating on the shortcut button as it is easy to activate it accidentally when writing or drawing. They should update the software to make it possible to disable it as I don't find it terribly useful anyway.Also, it is quite easy to send your docs to your computer as an email and from there to covert to a PDF and print. I do wish they would update so as to enable printing directly from the Scribe. Should be easy enough.",One person found this helpful
"Introducing Kindle Scribe (16 GB), the first Kindle for reading and writing, with a 10.2‚Äù 300 ppi Paperwhite display, includes Basic Pen",4.0,The best Kindle ever!,"Reviewed in the United States üá∫üá∏ on December 15, 2022",Option: Premium Pen | Setup: 32 GB | Offer Type: Without Kindle Unlimited,True,"I have now been using the Kindle Scribe for about a month and a week and there are several things that I've learned and would like to share.Reading:The reading experience on this device is excellent. There is plenty of room on the screen to fit an entire page of text at a larger font size or more if you shrink the text a little.The Scribe has all the reading features of the newer Kindle 2022 and Kindle Paperwhite 2021. It has the faster page turns, the page turn animations, dark mode, and glow light.Mangas on this device are perfect! The 10.2"" screen is big enough to fit an entire page of manga without having to zoom in. Mangas are typically in black and white so the lack of color is not an issue. The 300ppi of the carta 1200 screen in this device means that you can see the detail of the page without pixelation, it is the exact same as reading it in print.Notes:Notebooks are great. I'm a college student and taking notes using the notebooks is saving so much space in my backpack. I can do my homework on the device and then send it to my email from the kindle to turn it in.Taking notes in books is a great experience. You cannot write directly on the page of the book but that would cover up the words anyways (and who knows how you would be able to write on the book directly and change the font/font size). You can make sticky notes in books and handwrite/type out the notes. A lot of people complain that when they look at their notes, they don't see the context of the note but there is a solution for that, highlight the text you would like to take a note on and then after it's highlighted, tap the highlight and then tap notes. Following this procedure will allow you to see the notes along with the highlighted text you took the notes on giving you the context you need when looking at the notes.PDFs:I have used this device to sign documents and such which is really nice. You just send your PDF to your Kindle Scribe Via email or send-to-Kindle and you can draw on the PDF directly. When you email/send-to-Kindle, the PDF is converted to a static page that cannot be changed but can be written on. When you transfer over USB, the PDF will be a fully text flowable PDF where you can change things in the PDF but you will not be able to write/draw on it.What I have done is just emailed the document to my Kindle, wrote on it, and emailed it back to my personal email to then use on the computer.Gripes:There are a couple things that I am not happy with in this device.Pen features:Lack of pen options/features. The Kindle Scribe is using a WACOM digitizer layer and a WACOM pen for the note taking features. This tech supports thousands of pressure levels allowing for precise writing and drawing. The Kindle however lacks the software to support this. They do not support pressure sensitivity, or have any brushes other than a pen and a highlighter. This is fine for book note taking but in the notebooks, I would like to be able to choose from a variety of brushes and features. There is no handwriting to text, no shape creation, copy/paste, and no image support. The bottom line is that it's a great E-Reader but a pretty horrible E-Note.Auto Light:The auto light algorithm is a little messed up on this device. You need the light on when it's dark because you see the light reflected off the screen, it doesn't produce it's own light (thing of how you need light to read on paper as opposed to an LCD like on a phone that makes it's own light). You also don't need the light to be very bright or on at all when there is sufficient light in the room. The auto light instead turns up the light when it's in a bright environment and turns down/off the light when it's dark leaving you to fumble around to find the brightness slider in the dark. This is a broken feature and you should just manually adjust the brightness yourself.Conclusion:This is hands down the best kindle. It does have a few problems but they are outshined by all the great E-Reader functions. Amazon really has refined the Kindle to a point where there is no better way to read books digitally. Amazon also has stated that the Scribe will receive more note taking features in the months to come but you buy products, not promises. If the note taking isn't up to snuff for you, there are other devices that are better, or you can wait to see how much the Scribe improves in that area. We'll see what happens in the next few months.",115 people found this helpful
"Introducing Kindle Scribe (16 GB), the first Kindle for reading and writing, with a 10.2‚Äù 300 ppi Paperwhite display, includes Basic Pen",5.0,Short on functionality this early but fantastic device,"Reviewed in the United States on December 27, 2022",Option: Premium Pen | Setup: 64 GB | Offer Type: Without Kindle Unlimited,True,"I ordered this one as soon as it was announced and hadn't really realized how short on functionality it was going to ship with, but I'm still extremely happy with it so far.First up, it's a very nice Kindle device and is amazing for reading my books on. I adore the screen on it, and it's very snappy and responsive to navigate and write on. The screen size is also wonderful for reading on for my nearly 50 year old eyes that have somehow slipped into reminding me of my age by needing multi-focal lenses. One thing on this front that I miss from my Oasis is the buttons on the margin for page flipping. Those are nice on that device, although I don't hate that they're missing from this one, I just kind of wish they were there. Another thing I'm a little annoyed with is no 4G or 5G built in. I'll live without it and tethering isn't hard these days, but it's an annoyance that didn't need to exist on at least the top end models.I love the writing experience on the device, too. It's not smooth as glass like my iPad Pro with an Apple Pencil, it's much more like writing on paper. But it has a similar quick response to writing input that makes it feel pretty natural and not artificial or annoying, so Amazon have worked that part out well.The functionality is very basic at this point, which is probably the most negative aspect of the device. But it's actually SO basic that I have few doubts that this isn't in the pipeline to be addressed in software updates over the next several months. I would suggest not gambling on that if the cost is prohibitive to you because you should always make your purchase decisions on what you actually get when you buy, and not based on future promises or a naive belief that what you want will be delivered at any point. I can afford to live with my device as is, and it'll still meet the needs of why I bought it, just not optimally, if they don't add what I consider the missing functionality to it. That's not going to be true for everyone.The hardware they've used does support everything needed for all the additional features that I suspect Amazon is planning to add, if they've fully implemented it in the hardware, and at this price point, I believe they have, but I don't know it for sure.Things I think it's missing are:Pressure sensitivity for the penA wider array of writing tools (drawing tools primarily)Stroke based storage instead of converting strokes to pixelsAbility to zoom in and out of notes and drawingsHandwriting recognitionRelated to handwriting recognition, the ability to search note contentsMore organization options for notesPerhaps a second app to segment writing from drawing functions, but this isn't a want, just a speculation on how they may approach some of these features if they add themBetter Kindle integration - like having notes automatically sync to other Kindle devices and apps on other devices, more robust sharing options and integrating with other products like Office apps or drawing exports, etc.Ways to mark up a book with the pen beyond just the current sticky notes. This is a complicated ask because of the way ebooks are formatted, but it isn't unsolvable.My hope is that they are responsive to customer feedback and this becomes the premier Kindle e-ink device, and that they add this functionality to the current devices rather than milking them by only adding them to newer models. It seems more likely that they'll add most or all of the functionality to these devices, because otherwise they'd create a massive amount of customer backlash that they'd have to needlessly overcome, and that just isn't logical or necessary, so I think we'll see at least some of these features added over the coming several months to a year or two.",5 people found this helpful
"Introducing Kindle Scribe (16 GB), the first Kindle for reading and writing, with a 10.2‚Äù 300 ppi Paperwhite display, includes Basic Pen",3.0,"Incredible hardware, disappointing software","Reviewed in the United States on November 30, 2022",Option: Premium Pen | Setup: 32 GB | Offer Type: Without Kindle Unlimited,True,"+ Best hardware for the money+ Warmth and brightness sliders for the back light+ Pen requires no batteries, is light, and writes with minimal latency+ Great battery life (dropped just 2% overnight)+ Easy export of annotated documents to email- Writable pdfs necessitate minutes-long process of uploading them to Amazon's cloud on another device, then downloading them on the Scribe- Writing Toolbar always on screen while writing on a pdf- No landscape orientation optionThe Kindle Scribe has a lot of potential. The hardware is amazing. None of its competitors seem to be able to match the hardware--a 10.3"" screen; a backlight with not only adjustable brightness, but adjustable warmth; a writable surface, long battery life and a responsive stylus that does not require batteries--for the price. In fact, it's difficult to find another eReader that checks all of these boxes at all. It's thin, relatively light, and more comfortable to hold than a hardcover book of the same height and width, though re-learning how to hold it has been a bit of an adjustment coming from a Kindle Paperwhite and Kindle Fire 8. For me, the larger display more than makes up for the slight hit to ergonomics. My only quibble with the hardware is that erasing with the premium pen takes a surprising amount of force. Applying sufficient pressure to to depress the eraser button and dragging the pen feels to me like I'm going to scratch the screen. I haven't yet, but using the shortcut button to erase with the nib is much more pleasant and requires much less pressure. Other than that, it's difficult to think of a way to improve the hardware. Particularly, reading at night with the back light's warmth adjusted to filter out blue light is pleasant and unlike any other device I've used. It's excellent.The software, though, is where it becomes evident that this is a first-gen product on its first firmware revision. The big one for me: Although the promotions and ads are correct that you can write on pdfs on the Scribe, **you can only write on pdfs that you send to your device through the Amazon portal in a web browser on another device.** If you simply drag and drop a pdf onto the device over USB, then that pdf is going to be read-only. This reliance on Amazon's cloud service was not mentioned in the product description or advertising anywhere (**EDIT: Amazon has revised their product page to address this omission), is annoying, and raises some serious concerns about privacy. If you're sending an ebook in pdf form (typically 5-6mb), then the process of opening your browser, dragging and dropping it into the Amazon portal, waiting for it to upload, then opening your kindle, waiting for it to sync, finding the new item, clicking on it, waiting for it to download, and opening it is cumbersome but tolerable. If you're hoping to write on an even larger file like a scan of a book, though, get comfortable: the 50mb scan I uploaded took twelve minutes! Over a 500mb/s fiberoptic connection! Having to use proprietary web software to get usable pdfs to a separate device feels like a holdover from 2005. Having it take several minutes feels like a holdover from 1998.Aside from being unwieldy, dependence on a third-party cloud for writable pdfs presents a privacy problem. One thing I was hoping to do with the Scribe was grade student papers. I was picturing simply dumping a folder full of them onto the Scribe via USB or even WiFi over my own network. The first isn't possible and the second now seems like a distant dream. I can't in good conscience send my students' work to Amazon's servers. So I won't. **EDIT**: Amazon has since updated their product description attesting to the security of their servers. I believe them! But I still wouldn't feel comfortable managing students' work on the Scribe unless/until I'm able to transfer them back and forth over USB.The other issue with writable pdfs is that the Writing Toolbar must be on the screen if you want to mark up a pdf using the pen. This means looking at a dime-sized icon of a pen on every single page of whatever you're reading. Sure, there's an option to hide the icon, but doing so reduces the function of the pen to mere pointing and scrolling. If you want to write, then you're going to have to tolerate the icon. Why not offer an option to hide it while remembering its previously set function? Why not at least make it smaller and have it expand upon tapping it? Maybe it won't bother you, but I find it incredibly distracting.Lastly, there's no option to read in landscape mode, meaning there's no way to hold the Kindle on its side to view two pages at once as you might on an iPad. You're locked into portrait mode. Being able to hold the tablet sideways would've been welcome while reading lying down, which is a little tricky with the screen as tall as it is. It's also too tall for the shelf of the treadmill I like to use while reading sometimes, but a portrait mode option would've been fine. Hopefully this is an option that will become available as the Scribe firmware matures.If none of these three software shortcomings bothers you, then I don't think you'll find a better deal for comparable hardware. For me, though, they may be deal-breakers, which is too bad since the device itself is by far the best I've ever used to read ebooks.",761 people found this helpful
"Introducing Kindle Scribe (16 GB), the first Kindle for reading and writing, with a 10.2‚Äù 300 ppi Paperwhite display, includes Basic Pen",5.0,Waited for this device for 10 years,"Reviewed in the United States on January 5, 2023",Option: Basic Pen | Setup: 16 GB | Offer Type: Without Kindle Unlimited,True,"I love my Kindle Scribe and wanted to give it a well thought out review so thought I would do it in sections.What is eink:EInk is literally ink on the screen. The idea is that when people read a long 50 pages document on a computer the first instinct is often to print it out before reading it.  Reading on a pixelated glowing TV screen is hard on the eyes.  That's not a problem with eink because it's literally ink on the screen. As a result of this fact you can't watch YouTube videos because it takes a half second to display that ink on the screen. Also, it's not in color (so far) because well, it's ink.  But this makes for a beautiful distraction free experience that feels very natural for what it is. Also because it's ink the battery is AMAZING I can easily last over a month of reading and writing and I'm using it about 2 hours a day.Kindle historyAround 2007 the Kindle was a big deal. A 6 inch eink screen was a novel idea but they were really slow at keeping up with the times.  Most people's phones are 6 inches and yet Amazon confusingly did not make any attempts at allowing customers any relatively larger screen size until 2022?  6 inch screens are fine if your in your 20s but for people who wear glasses or simply want larger fonts it gets frustrating that The Man won't allow use a larger screen.  On top of this, eink is so good for all the reasons I stated above.  It is only intuitive to branch out and go for writing as well.  Keep in mind I have been waiting for a kindle with a larger screen and one I could write on since about 2012.The Kindle ScribeOk, so that's my history with Kindle and now I finally have my scribe. And.....I am not disappointed.  Reading is better than ever on it's 10.2 screen. I can have large fonts without worrying about changing the page to soon. It's truly a breath of fresh air after years of waiting.  Writing....lived up to my 10 years of anticipation.  I was worried it wouldn't.  It was a lot to live up to.  The large screen size really makes writing feel like a true page.  The lined pages have allowed me to write around 30 pages thus far this month without any problems whatsoever. The writing feels just like writing in a notebook except that I'm not lugging it around. It has been an amazing experience having the scribe so far.  It is so thin due to not having a thick qwerty keyboard like a laptop yet I can easily WRITE notes on it and read.  Below are some future hopes for kindle but I'm impressed and strongly recommend it.  Probably more for those who know what eink and kindle are before the newer folks.Hopes:1. Schedule planner and Calendar App.This should really be built into the Scribe.  The pen and paper feels and write perfectly and if The Man would allow us to organize are week and month on the Kindle that would be amazing.2. Notebook page turnAfter writing 30 pages or so it seems I have to turn through each of the 30 pages one by one.  I should obviously be able to scroll through the pages in a faster way.3. It would be great if I could make an index for my notes (cookie crumbs) so that I can select a word like a class subject and be taken to that page in my notebook.  It would make scrolling a lot easier and organized.",8 people found this helpful
"Introducing Kindle Scribe (16 GB), the first Kindle for reading and writing, with a 10.2‚Äù 300 ppi Paperwhite display, includes Basic Pen",4.0,"ALMOST love it, but needs a few updates","Reviewed in the United States on February 5, 2023",Option: Basic Pen | Setup: 16 GB | Offer Type: Without Kindle Unlimited,True,"I really, truly love this thing. Reading on a larger screen is great, I like it better than the oasis because there's less frequent page turns. The Scribe is one of those devices that now that I have it, it's something I don't want to live without. I used to have the smaller Onyx Color Nova eink tablet but the screen was too small to use it as a notebook, and I found myself going back to regular notepads pretty consistently. When the screen cracked while it was safely stowed in my book bag, the company did nothing to help (except quote almost the price of the device to get it fixed).I got the scribe because I was excited to see a mainstream company dive into this market, but Amazon needs to take it seriously and not just flop on updates like they do on so many other devices (remember the phone they made for a year or two?).For instance, the notebook experience is seriously lacking. For me, it's got the bare minimum, and that's okay. I really just want to take handwritten notes, I don't need to transfer anything to text, I just need a way to get my thoughts down, and this does that really well.EXCEPT the fact that sometimes I need to refer to those notes while I'm working on a project and the dang screen times out after ten minutes every time. Unless Amazon lets me disable sleep mode on this thing, it's going to get traded in for a different device (probably back to a larger Onyx tablet, because at least with Onyx, I can download the kindle app and still read my books...I'll just cover the tablet with bubble wrap whenever I stow it in my bag).The other majorly lacking issue is the fact that when I jot notes on a PDF, I have to email a copy of the PDF to be able to see those notes anywhere but on the Scribe itself. I can't even see the notes on another kindle (my oasis). I'd love to be able to see those notes on the PDF in my kindle library on any device I have the Kindle app. Like on my iPad, or my phone. Instead of having to send the PDF every time I make a change to my notes. It's kind of silly that this isn't already possible.Those seem like two very basic updates that *should* be an easy fix, but I hate the idea of wondering if I'm just waiting for changes that will never come.Please, Amazon...don't give up on the Scribe. The eInk notebook market is real, people want devices like this. Give us good reason to choose your digital notebook over the competition (Lenovo, Onyx, Remarkable, Kobo, etc). The sooner, the better please.*Edited*It would also be WONDERFUL if amazon allowed me to use my iPad (with Apple Pencil) to write on my existing notes in the notepad area of the Kindle app...if I could write up notes on my scribe, then make changes while I'm on the go during the day on my iPad, and those updates appear on the scribe later that night, it would be so amazing. I'm adding that to the list of features I'd love to see this thing get. I hope Amazon takes feedback seriously and attempts to perfect this thing.",4 people found this helpful

I have loved my Kindle Oasis so was excited to have the option of an e-ink notebook from someone tried and true, especially because I wasn't sure how much use it would actually get. In a lot of ways my faith was not misplaced. The tablet feels sturdy, the interface is intuitive and easy to use and everything I like about my Kindle (the readability, the library, etc.) is effective. I've had this about a month and use it all the time but as much as I'm enjoying it, in some ways it makes me regret not taking the risk on another company. It turns out an e-ink tablet/notebook really is an amazing addition to my professional technology arsenal and the hardware here doesn't disappoint, but while I expected some fewer features and less bells and whistles then competitors the notebook capabilities here are missing some really fundamental basic things that are necessary for anyone like me who is hoping to use it as their primary notetaking device/format. I want to be able to recommend this to others who are looking for an e-ink tablet and some updates (which I still hope are possible with software updates) are necessary before that is possible.Pros:- Its a joy to write on, the pen/screen combination is really nice to use even for a cursive user then me.- The eraser function on the premium pen works great.- I love being able to use it both for kindle book reading/pdf annotation and notebooks switching between these functions is easy- The battery life has been very good for me and that ""always ready"" capability was a key reason I wanted this in addition to an iPad.- While there aren't a ton of templates the available templates are easy to use and meet my needs well.- The screen is great for reading, I wasn't sure I'd like the bigger size but its been great, especially for comics/cookbooks and pdfs.- Writing on pdfs worked really nicely and my notes were easy to read afterwards which is a huge plus for me.Notebok must haves: These are the things that would make me want to change my rating and not regret buying this over a competitor. They are ""pressure points"" that I frequently come across while using the Scribe.- There needs to be some way to navigate through a notebook without just flipping through pages. If you only use it for taking notes that will build in order (like to-do lists) the Scribe is fine but a potentially large notebook by swiping through pages is quickly unwieldy. There are a lot of ways this could work: you could allow people to create tabbed sections in a notebook, labeled bookmarks that you can jump to, or subject tags.-There needs to be ways to add pages in particular parts in a notebook  or a way to re-organize your pages. If you think your done with one note section and need to extend it or you want to put new related notes to a previous set of notes you are out of luck, whatever you add has to go to the end always.-  You should be able to add pages from different templates in a single notebook. I think it is very common to have a workflow that would include a to-do list, a blank page for mind mapping or wire framing and lined pages for notes. If they gave us the ability to add pages choosing the template would be great.These three features are basic features I'd expect to have in an e-notebook and the key things that generally make them more functional than paper notebooks.- I don't mind not being able to write on kindle books, which I know is a concern of others, and I thought the handwritten post it style notes worked well but I'd like to be able to access my handwritten notes on other devices (like the kindle computer app) when I'm working.I'd like to have: these things would be nice in a perfect world but I wouldn't need them to be happy.- I'd love to be able to pull up highlights, sections or notes from a Kindle book while in a notebook. I do research and being able to look at highlights from the book in a smaller window (like the one you handwrite notes in when in the Kindle book) while in a notebook would be amazing for researcher or students.- Some form of searchability within a notebook, even if its tags, would be really helpful.- It needs to be easier to get pages from notebooks off the Kindle Scribe to be shared/used elsewhere.If your primary goal is to have a larger sized e-reader with some pfd marking up capability this is a great device 5/5. If you, like me (who pre-ordered it when they were vague about notebook capabilities) were primarily interested in an e-ink tablet for notetaking and was excited to have it combined with an e-reader I'd wait for an update, which after saving up for this one I'm hoping will be via software so early adopters aren't left in the cold.",38 people found this helpful

I tried the Remarkable, Boox, and now Scribe.  After reading comparisons of the Scribe and Remarkable, I thought I would be disappointed in the Scribe since many reviewers preferred the Remarkable.  I wasn't!I sent the Remarkable back for reasons I'll detail below.I never really got to try the Boox; it didn't come with the app, and I always got an error message when I tried to download it, so that went back as well.  Also, the meager instructions for it are truly awful.The Scribe has been a pleasant surprise -- I've found it to be much more responsive and user-friendly than the Remarkable.  Please note:  I'm only using the Scribe for the notebook function; I haven't used it yet as a Kindle.My needs are pretty simple.  I wanted an e-ink tablet to deal with all the clutter on my desk.  I have to take a lot of notes, especially from phone conversations and Zoom meetings, and I end up with lots of notes scattered around.  Yellow pads didn't work, and putting them in file folders to be stored in a file cabinet ensured they would be lost!  An e-notebook was my solution, and it's worked really well.One of my issues from the start with the Remarkable was a problem with battery charging.  I reported it to customer service and they wrote back with a list of things to do.  None of them fixed the problem, so they sent me a link to sent it back for repair.  I filled out the required information, and a few days later, got a message from their tech. dept. saying that ""my request"" had been denied!  They sent me a list of more things to try, including one that involved buying a new cable.  I wasn't about to pay more for this already expensive device.  I clicked on the link they sent to respond, and it turned out to be a page for starting the process with customer service all over again!  At that point, I threw up my hands and decided to return it.Some differences I've noted:On my Remarkable, swiping often didn't work the first time, even though I swiped exactly where customer service told me to.  Moving from page to page could be laborious. The Scribe is lightning fast.  In general, the Remarkable functions seemed clunkier and slower.I find the writing ""feel"" to be the same, though again, the Scribe seems more responsive in general.  Maybe my Remarkable was a lemon, but dealing with customer service was so frustrating that I didn't want to pursue it.I liked the screen size on the Remarkable better.  It's a little bigger, and I wish the Scribe were the same.The Scribe doesn't charge for a subscription.  It bothered me that after a year with Remarkable, I'd have to start paying a monthly fee.The on/off button on the Scribe seems to be in a weird place, but I can live with that.By the way, Remarkable is located in Norway, so it takes a couple of days to get a response from customer service.  Also, when you buy it, they don't tell you they are in Norway -- if you pay with a bankcard, you can get charged for a foreign transaction fee (in my case $16.00 which my bank waived when I complained).As I said, my needs are pretty simple, and the Scribe has been perfect for giving me a clutter-free desk!",5 people found this helpful

It has a large screen, quick refresh, sensitive touch and most of the things you‚Äôd want in a high end kindle (except page turn buttons). It has audible support and its great to have a digital notebook in the same device as my Kindle Library.As a digital notebook however, it is a mild failure. When writing The Scribe feels almost as good as the Remarkable 2. It‚Äôs not quite AS good - maybe 85% of the way there - but it is close enough. And despite the busted lighting on my unit, having a lit screen is a huge win over Remarkable. The UI is also snappier and quicker to navigate than Remarkable. But that is where the advantages disappear.- No lasso tool for moving notes around the page. I know I never had that in my old paper notebooks but I‚Äôve been spoiled by the RM2.- Fewer types of pens and no pencils or brushes. The scribe has varying widths of ballpoint and a highlighter. That‚Äôs it. None with any pressure sensitive elements that I am aware of. RM2 has 8 different pens/pencils/brushes - several of which use pressure and tilt. I do a fair amount of sketching in my RM2. 90% of the time a medium-fine ballpoint will do the trick but its nice to have options.- No ability to bring up a page list and skip around in a notebook. This is the most egregious. There is no way for me to quickly open up to one portion of a notebook as far as I can tell. You just have to swipe through page after page. This makes the digital version worse than the real thing!- PDFs have to be emailed to Kindle and are stored in the Library with books instead of with my notes. I want to be able to import organizers and keep them with the rest of my notes and organization tools, not with my myriad Stephen King books and the weird stuff my wife buys for writing research. In the RM2 PDFs have their own tab, which is fine.- PDFs can be searched but there is no thumbnail view to visually reference multiple pages at once. There is no way to add pages or layers as you can in the RM2. And though it says there‚Äôs a landscape option, it never has the ability to actually do it. RM2 is much more flexible in this regard.If I could have exchanged this thing, I think I would take some time to see if the advantages outweigh the disadvantages. But having written this up and now looking at them side by side, I don‚Äôt know that it is worth the hassle of returning this one and ordering a new one. I do need a new kindle, the lit screen would be aces if it worked and the Scribe feels significantly snappier‚Ä¶ but as a digital notebook the RM2 is superior in almost every other way. So I‚Äôll probably just return this and keep using my Remarkable 2 for now.",16 people found this helpful
"Introducing Kindle Scribe (16 GB), the first Kindle for reading and writing, with a 10.2‚Äù 300 ppi Paperwhite display, includes Basic Pen",5.0,the best kindle EVER,"Reviewed in the United States on March 31, 2023",Option: Premium Pen | Setup: 16 GB | Offer Type: Without Kindle Unlimited,True,"As a teacher who is always looking for ways to streamline my note-taking process in the classroom, I was excited to try out the new Kindle Amazon Scribe. I have to say, I was not disappointed. The first thing that struck me about the Scribe was how lightweight and portable it is. It's easy to slip into my bag and take with me wherever I go. I bought the foldable case and stand for it to ensure it was protected, and I have never worried it wouldn't survive a trip in my tote bag. I also appreciated the comfortable grip and the fact that it doesn't feel too bulky in my hand, even when I'm taking notes for an extended period. The writing experience on the Scribe is fantastic. I got the premium pen and it is such a cool little device. The pen feels natural and responsive, and I love that it has a precision tip for detailed work. I found that I could write quickly and accurately without any lag or delay. The screen is also easy on the eyes, and the adjustable brightness means that I can use it comfortably in any lighting conditions. One of the features that I really love about the Scribe is the notebook function. As someone who loves to jot down ideas, make to-do lists, and scribble down notes, having a digital notebook that I can access on-the-go has been a game-changer. I particularly appreciate the ability to organize my notes into different notebooks and to add tags for easy searching. Another great feature of the Scribe is the ability to annotate and highlight text in books. As an avid reader, this is something that I've always wanted in an e-reader, and the Scribe delivers. I found it easy to highlight passages and make notes as I read, and the ability to export these notes to my computer for later reference is a real plus. Overall, I would highly recommend the Kindle Amazon Scribe to anyone looking for a versatile note-taking tool that can also serve as an e-reader. Its lightweight design, responsive pen, and powerful notebook function make it an excellent choice for students, professionals, and anyone who wants to keep their notes organized and accessible.",2 people found this helpful
"Introducing Kindle Scribe (16 GB), the first Kindle for reading and writing, with a 10.2‚Äù 300 ppi Paperwhite display, includes Basic Pen",3.0,"Great for Kindle books, Not-so-great for anything else","Reviewed in the United States on December 30, 2022",Option: Premium Pen | Setup: 32 GB | Offer Type: Without Kindle Unlimited,True,"As most of the reviews (both here and on third-party sites) mention, this is a great piece of hardware. The screen is clear and responsive, the backlight is uniform, the rear case is lovely, the pen feels lightweight and tacky enough for a solid grip...it feels far more premium than any other Kindle I've owned. Reading Kindle books is also very enjoyable. While it's not as easy to hold as a smaller Kindle, the screen size and sharpness make reading a joy, and the ability to handwrite in the sticky notes is much easier and more fluid than typing as I did on previous Kindles.The main issue with the Scribe is the software, and I'm not confident Amazon is willing to invest the time and resources to make this anything beyond a big Kindle you can (sometimes) write on. Below is a list of bugs, annoyances, and missing features that you should be aware of prior to purchasing. I'm sure there are plenty more, but this is what I've noticed after only 24 hours of using the device.1) PDF Navigation - Links to other pages in PDF documents do not work on the Scribe. I imported the ESV Digital Scripture Journal, which I used extensively on my iPad without issue, and the links are all broken. I tried every method of upload (Send to Kindle website, Send to Kindle email, side loading via USB-C, etc.), and the links will not work. Because I know this PDF works on other readers and the issue exists with both Send to Kindle and side loading, it has to be an issue with the Scribe software.2) Exporting ""Watermark"" - Exporting notes puts a giant Kindle logo in the top right corner of the page. I had hoped to make notes and then share via email (which works without issue), but when I do that, my notes are sullied by an unnecessary and ridiculous Kindle logo. This is maddening.3) PDF Inconsistency - PDFs are handled differently depending on when they were uploaded and the method of upload. The only way to annotate a PDF document is to use the Send to Kindle feature after November 2022 or so. You cannot write on any PDF documents previously sent to a Kindle, nor any PDF that is uploaded via USB-C. Furthermore, the settings and features for PDF reading are different depending on the method of upload. There are videos online that walk you though these differences if you want to dig into this. I find this inconsistency very frustrating.4) Exporting Limitations - You can only export via email (not directly to any online storage services, and exporting via email does not save any previously used email addresses, other than the quick send address. This is an issue for many of the specific send-to email addresses, which tend to be long and time consuming to type every time. For example, the email address to send documents to Day One journal is 50+ characters long. I should be able to type this once and have it saved as a previously used address to avoid having to retype every time. Additionally, the export PDF has gigantic margins and doesn't make use of the full page.5) Notetaking Limitations - Many other reviews already mention the half-baked note taking as the most significant defect, and I agree. The Notebook options are missing nearly every useful tool from other note apps. For example, copy/paste, lasso to move notes, inserting pages, pressure sensitivity, navigation options (e.g., table of contents, page overview, scrubbing, etc.), and reordering pages are all missing. The most annoying missing feature is the ability to use your own templates, which I used extensively in Goodnotes for things like meeting notes, morning pages, etc.6) OCR / Search - There is no OCR and no handwriting search. This is a really important feature to being able to locate notes, especially given the limitations in navigating Notebooks. Notability and Goodnotes for iOS are great examples of how this should work, and Amazon needs to build this feature into the Scribe software. For now, I have to export everything to a third-party service to make notes searchable.7) Annoying toolbar - The annotation toolbar dropdown is way to big and cannot me moved out of the way. You can only remove it completely (making annotation impossible) or move it to the other side of the screen. Furthermore, it's a big circle that is filled-in, which is distracting. This should be less obtrusive and able to be put in the corner of the screen.8) Difficult to switch documents - There is no way to quickly open recently access documents or books. So, if you are reading a PDF that cannot be annotated or a Kindle book, you can only access your Notebooks by exiting the PDF/Book, navigating to the Notebooks tab, and finding the note you are looking for. There should be a swipe up gesture that shows all recently accessed items, so you can quickly flip from a Book/PDF to the note. This is important given the limitations put on which items you can actually write on.I will use this for a couple more weeks before making the keep/return decision. I'd like to see how quickly Amazon pushes out updates to fix the bugs and add basic missing features.",47 people found this helpful

It's a worthwhile purchase just for the reading experience (if you don't mind holding such a large device or the cold metal feel in your hands).The ""pen to paper"" writing experience is better than any e-ink handwriting device I've used, including the Kobo Sage (terrible) and the reMarkable 2 (comparable to Scribe but a notch below, in my opinion). The experience feels almost as real as pen to paper.(Note: The lack of pressure sensitivity doesn't bother me. I'm mostly just using it for writing. Artists might want to hold off until that functionality is adopted. And it technically could be added because the pressure sensitivity works on the reMarkable 2 using Amazon's Scribe pen. UPDATE [3/7/2023]: The latest firmware includes new pen types and ""enhanced"" tilt- and pressure-sensitivity capabilities.)Writing and highlighting directly on PDFs sent to the Scribe is a great experience. Handwritten notes in e-books are little more clunky, but acceptable.With that said, the Scribe's notebook software is rudimentary (as of February 2023). All the disadvantages of a paper notebook are inherent in the current software. Here are some basic features I think need to be added as soon as possible:1) The ability to navigate to pages from an index (with page previews) instead of only via swiping or guessing the page number2) The ability to select different page templates for different pages in a notebook3) I don't want the Scribe to add a page to a notebook without me confirming that I want to add a page. Sometimes it misinterprets my hand moving across the page while writing as a swipe. Next thing I know, I'm on a blank page that I never asked for.For the future:4) The ability to add, copy, and move pages anywhere in a notebook. (Bonus: The ability to move or copy pages to other notebooks)5) The ability to download my notebooks from Amazon's website and the Kindle app. (Note: The only way to get your notebooks now is to have Amazon email you a link to download a PDF.)6) The ability to export a subset of pages from a notebook instead of always the entire thingAnd if Amazon really decides to go crazy:7) Nondestructive handwriting-to-text conversion",

I had such high hopes for this device, I have always loved e-ink devices, and when I saw this I expected a great book reader (which it mostly is) and a great notebook device (which it definitely is not).Why can't I choose landscape or portrait on a per-book basis?The ability to listen to my Audible version would be enhanced if I could multitask - read the companion book and take notes, or even have a notebook open. I cannot see the logic of carrying around a 10-inch reader to listen to Audible without being able to take notes.Why can't I rotate a PDF, control the zoom size on a PDF, or at least have the text reflow?Only 1 type of pen with 5 sizes to choose from?The highlighter should have a way to choose a freehand or straight line.There is not even basic shape support - straight line, square, triangle, circle.It is using Wacom technology but there is no pressure sensitivity for sketching or sketch-notes.Why can't I have more than one type of template in a notebook?Why is there no way to jump to a page in a notebook - I have to flip endlessly if the notebook is long - a way to navigate notebooks is essential.Why can't I insert a page in the middle of a notebook?No copy-paste or lasso and move in a note.No way to rotate a note.Why can't I move PDF Notebook Planners to the notebook section?A browser that is essentially useless.Why can't I create a template for a note?And to add insult to injury it was preorder in September, delivered in December, and placed on sale in January. Perhaps, if sales are low improving the features should be a priority. Unfortunately, by the time I decided it was not rich in features the return window had passed. My only consolation is that as a teacher I find it useful in my classroom because of its size. I can sit with a student and point out areas of a text as we discuss a book.EDIT - I just manually updated to 5.16.1.2 and the new features added are a great start. There are now multiple pen and pencil choices with 5 widths and it seems like some pressure sensitivity, plus tilt support. Still, no select to move/resize and you have to use the same template for the whole notebook. There is still no option for user templates either. The new screensavers are OK but why can't I choose which one I want, better yet why can't I use my own?Edit - add layers, greyscale colors, and a better eraser PLEASE.

I have never been able as much as i wanted, to use a kindle.  Never quite knew why, just that I didnt like them.  Until the scribe.  It has a BIG screen, almost a full page.  I realized I needed a screen that was almost a page size as I got used to reading a full page (or 2 pages side by side) in a book.  Regular kindle sized I felt constrained and it limited my reading speed.  So this has a full page and it is 300 dpi so it feels like a real book.  The backlighting is a bit limited.  White (bluish) is fine, but the warmth addition color is a bit greenish yellow, so it is not as comfortable reading as others.  I also have a boox note and the warmth is red toned and I defintely can tell it is more confortable reading at night than the kindle.  The boox note is not as big and harder to read a full page.  So the scribe for me wins with a few issues.  The biggest one is the weight.  by itself, it is 15.4 oz and just barely light enough to hold for an extended period.  The lightest case I found is about 5 oz and that just puts it over the edge for one handed extended holding.  I have been looking for a transparent plastic skin but no one sells one.  The wacom pen is ok, there are a lot better wacom pens for the same price as the premium one.  Worth it to me.  Hopefully, they will improve the writing aspect with software.

Or just go third party on the stylus.I got this because I am, if nothing else, a hand writer. I have notebooks for everything and a new planner every year. In an effort to kill fewer trees and not have to drag four hundred notebooks with me everywhere I went, I got the Scribe. And honestly? For writing? It‚Äôs aces. The response from the stylus is great. It‚Äôs comfortable. The new pen tools (like calligraphy and pencil) keep my handwriting from looking an utter mess. My biggest complaints are that it‚Äôs a little too big to comfortably read on anywhere but at a table, and that on longer handwritten documents, the page turns are SUPER slow.The premium stylus, though?I‚Äôm sorry. It sucks. It is too skinny to hold for long periods of time (and I write for hours some days) without cramping, and no matter what position I hold it in, I am never not accidentally pressing the button. It‚Äôs in exactly the wrong spot. It needs to be up about a half an inch higher (or much harder to activate). The eraser is great and I actually like the tips it comes with a lot, but genuinely I‚Äôd happily forgo the eraser to not have to deal with the stupid button. I wish I could return just the pen.This, admittedly, could just be me: I‚Äôm just as particular about my actual pens and notebooks. But for as much as I still do use the Scribe, I think I could have given up notebooks entirely (well, for new projects anyway) if this just had a more comfortable pen.I seriously hate the button, man.",

I have had Kindles for many years and still have an Oasis. But this thing is amazing! I love the larger size, it doesn't feel heavy to me at all, and since you can just as easily swipe to change pages I don't think the absence of buttons is a big deal (or even a small deal, not sure why people are so hung up on that tbh). The writing feel is fantastic, just like writing on paper. The pen works great, I've been writing and drawing (badly lol), and there is no lag. I have the Premium pen and love the eraser at the end. You don't even have to press down to erase, lightly touching it to the screen works just fine. Battery life is stellar, easy to switch notebooks, start a notebook, add or delete pages, just overall amazing user experience. Takes just a few seconds to add PDFs from my iPad to Send to Kindle, and send notebooks from the Scribe to my email. Plenty of templates and pen options for my needs. I am using this to read Kindle books and to store and write on knitting patterns. I was using books and an Apple Pencil, but I wasn't a huge fan of how it felt to write on the glass screen. This works SOO much better, easier to write on and make notes in the pattern PDFs. Maybe the negative reviewers were expecting this to be something it's not (like a Remarkable that is practically twice the cost and makes you pay a monthly subscription for certain features), but I for one love it and would highly recommend!",One person found this helpful

Our Elementary aged child has used it to test out ideas for class projects before going full into them on regular paper.I have enjoyed using 3rd party websites to send all kinds of puzzles, mazes, soduku to the Scribe via PDF. It is a joy to do these on the Scribe, compared to even regular paper.Swiping the screen left to right is not asfast as an iPad & the Web Browser is very basic.The ‚Äúpremium‚Äù pen doesnt glitch & does what Amazon says it will do. There are different fonts and each font allows you to change the thickness. Eraser works perfect, as does the Highlighter.The leather cover that comes with is lightweight and soft. Has a seperate pen holder to more securely hold it. When you open case, screen turns on. When you close case, screen turns off. Convienent.Only con is I noticed that there are some kids books that you cannot upload on the Scribe & you cannot setup a Kids+ profile on the Scribe.We enjoy the device very much. It is too expensive, but somehow worth it! If Amazon can keep providing updates to make more features for note-taking, adding Kids profiles etc this will be a device that is used lots for years to come.",

For reading a book, I like the larger screen. It is similar in size to reading a hardcover book. I like it that the Scribe comes ad-free. I am not sure if this was an update on all the Kindles, but the Scribe has the option of displaying the cover of the last opened book on the Lock Screen. I know that has been a requested feature for some time. But of course we already know that the Kindle is a good eReader. Lets talk about the Notebooks.For my purposes, the notebooks work great. I like to take notes by hand to help in memory recall. I am less interested in searching my notes, so the fact the the Kindle does not convert my handwriting to text is not an issue for me. I like having an unlimited paged notebook everywhere I go. With the Kindle and notebook all in one it is just one less thing I have to carry or remember to grab.My one issue with the notebook is how cumbersome it is to bounce back and for between the notebooks and a book I am reading. If you are just reading or just taking notes, there is no problem. But if you are taking notes on a book you are reading on the Kindle, then it is less than ideal. Currently, you have to close the notebook you are in and exit out of the notebook section of the Kindle, then click on your Library and select the book you are reading to reopen it. Then do the reverse to go back to the notebook. I wish you could attach or start a new notebook from within a book. Or have some way to toggle back and forth between a notebook and a book. I noticed if you swipe up from the bottom of the Kindle screen, it brings up skimming the book pages screen. What if instead it brought up your notebook, and what if you had the option of making the notebook full or half screen?For me, this was a great purchase and suites my needs. I think the notebook needs to be better integrated with the rest of the device. Right now it feels like it is two separate things, an eBook reader and a notebook.",One person found this helpful

It doesn't have the plastic feel that most Kindles do, but it is still very light and easy to handle. I'm also quite impressed with how responsive it is for an e-ink display. The latency on the pen is very low and it really does feel like writing on a paper notebook. The eraser on the pen works just like the eraser on a pencil would. When you go to erase something, it doesn't erase an entire line just because you touched it, it will only erase the part of the line that you touch. This means that if you erase a word on a line that the tail of a Y goes into, you will erase part of the Y's tail, but not the entire letter, which is something that has frustrated me when using most notebook apps on my tablet. The USB port is on the left side of the device, in a good spot where it doesn't get in the way if you need to charge while using it, which is something that a lot of device manufacturer's don't seem to get right. The pen feels good in my hand and is comfortable to use. Hardware-wise, I would give the Scribe a 10/10.From a software standpoint, I do have some complaints. You can only apply a template to an entire notebook, not just a single page. It would be nice if I could throw a calendar onto a page and still have lines on the other pages. Maybe it's possible, but I'm not aware of a way to create your own templates, and that would be a really nice feature. I'm also not sure how to access my notebooks off of my Scribe. Supposedly you can access them in the Kindle app on other devices, but they don't seem to be showing up for me, no matter how many times I run a sync on both devices. The pen toolbar is really rather useless with the advanced pen, and gets in the way. I'd like a way to turn it off and not just move it from one side of the screen to the other. It would also be nice to be able to set a default template for notebooks and have a quick button that would create a new note with a default time/date name, so I could quickly start a notebook and go back to clean it up later.In all reality, the complaints I have are all easily fixed with future software updates, and I fully expect Amazon to improve the software as time goes by. Considering that, these aren't as much complaints as they are suggestions to Amazon for future revisions. Such is the life of an early adopter. Time will tell for sure, but I feel as though I am going to be very happy with my purchase.Edit: I found one cool thing by accident. It turns out the pen for the Scribe works with Samsung devices, and vice versa. That's a bonus if you're in that ecosystem already.Edit 2: The battery life on the Scribe is amazing. The two biggest annoyances are the tool button that is always sitting there, unused and in the way, and it will flip to another page while I'm still writing on one. The page flip seems to happen when I'm toward the bottom of the page and finish one line, moving my hand back to the left to start a new line.",42 people found this helpful

Its extremely clear and great for reading manga and other comics (which is the primary reason I wanted this specific device). The picture quality is so clear and the comics don't feel cramped at all. (exception being for 2 page panels. Its unfortunate that I can't flip this device horizontally...). There is a little bit of after imaging I've noticed on some pages, but for the most part reading manga has been a great experience!- Note taking feels fantastic. The size of the screen is perfect for notetaking and the texture of the screen really does make this the best writing experience of any tablet I've used in the past. The responsiveness of the pen to showing up on the screen really makes it feel seamless. Pretty much like writing on paper- The device feels premium. Feels weighty and very sturdy. Same for the pen. Pen has a good weight to it and really feels like a quality fat pen, excellent in the hand.- Battery life is so good! I charged it on the first day I got it and in the last 5 days, I've only used about 25-30%. So it should be able to give me over 2 weeks on one single charge.Now for the Cons:- I really don't love the way the tablet feels in the hand and I really think its due to the large bezel. It puts a lot of weight on the hand and I find that I have to hold it with two hands otherwise I start to feel like my left hand is cramping up holding it on its own. Hopefully this is alleviated with a case in the future.-The notes are very limited. As great as the writing experience is on the Scribe, its a shame that the note taking feature pretty much just has a pen, eraser and highlighter and that's pretty much all you can do with it. Compared to Samsung notes that can convert notes to text, drag notes to a different location, change colors etc. it does feel like a downgrade. Its also a little annoying that there aren't any good ways to share notes on the kindle. I believe you can export the files, but it would be nice to have a way to share them between devices more fluidly.- Since I haven't had a touchscreen kindle before, the UI has gotten frustrating and feels inconsistent at times. At some point the back button just refused to show up at all for one of my books (so I think there are some bugs that need to be worked out. Ended up having to restart my Scribe to get back to the home menu)Overall I don't regret this purchase. This is a great kindle especially if you want to read manga or comics and to me, I feel like this is a decent price for this kind of device. If they fix some of the issues with the software and add more features to the note taking, I can see this being one of my favorite devices and my go-to reader/notetaker for a long while!",22 people found this helpful

I did not want a kindle.Now, I'm resentful that I use it for EVERYTHING.The scribe has been an absolutely amazing life changer. That is not hyperbole.Quick anecdote:I came of age with the internet and grew into adulthood as smartphone rapidly reshaped our relationship with the internet. The ""Internet of Everything"" had become a constant campanion... even when I wanted a break from the relationship. Re-entering a university setting, I found myself deeper in than ever before. I could not sustain the relationship and my mental health.Enter right: Kindle Scribe. I knew Kindle's pedigree and decided I wanted nothing to do with them or their family. However, Kindle's assistant, god knows why, had different plans. The assistant took every opportunity to interfere with my night just to tell me how great Kindle is. ""WHAT NERVE!"" I thought. After hours of her hounding, I finally gave in and spoke with Kindle. Kindle spoke with charm as they instructed me of how I could be free from the toxicity of my relationship with the internet.Grounded Thoughts:Obviously what the kindle is known for, the paper and ink technology. It's like looking at paper from the noble tree and ink from the sneaky squid.I have a practical clipboard that lets me ensure I have the most recent form!

"Introducing Kindle Scribe (16 GB), the first Kindle for reading and writing, with a 10.2‚Äù 300 ppi Paperwhite display, includes Basic Pen",3.0,"Great e-reader, bafflingly poor note-taking software","Reviewed in the United States on December 7, 2022",Option: Premium Pen | Setup: 16 GB | Offer Type: Without Kindle Unlimited,True,"Edit to original review:I don‚Äôt know if it was added after or before and I missed it (I am sure the latter), but Amazon has committed to updates addressing most of my issues with the note taking software. When those things are added, I‚Äôll update to a 4 or 5 star review.This is my third e-ink notebook, having purchased both the reMarkable 2 and an Onyx Boox Note Air 2 Plus. The big draw for me was maybe condensing my e-ink notebooks to one that lets me annotate Kindle books, and still have a great device for taking notes.The hardware is good; excellent battery life, not too heavy, even front lighting. The pen nibs don't provide as much friction as the reMarkable's, but it's not bad, though it could be better. It's somewhere between a reMarkable and an iPad. I heard Kevin Keith say on a podcast that they went through many iterations and settled on this, but I find that hard to believe. Still, it's not terrible. The 300 ppi display is great for reading books, though surprisingly thinner pen strokes aren't as crisp as you would expect (they're as good as the reMarkable, not as good as the Note Air, and both of those have lower-resolution e-ink displays). Page turn buttons on the hand-side bezel would've been great, though I can understand how that limits where you can hold it, so perhaps it's better that they didn't include them. Like the Note Air, the power button and the charging port are on the left side, a puzzling choice, but it is what it is. I opted not to get any covers because all of them operate on the premise that I want a top-folding cover, which I don't.It's the software that makes or breaks a good e-ink tablet. None of the others are perfect. reMarkable refuses to add a Kindle app, and the native ebook software there is really bad. It has no lighting at all, either, but the actual note software is really good. It's only missing note-searching, something the Note Air does. The Note Air is a full Android tablet, but it's trying to do too much with a really annoying and confusing interface. When I need to do serious note-taking, I turn to the reMarkable 2. It has a well thought out interface, and can do quite a bit.And I was hoping I'd get the same with the Kindle Scribe. Finally, I can annotate my Kindle books! This is important to me since I read a lot of programming books and philosophy texts. Having additional free-form notebooks would be great!However, that falls short.First, there are a limited number of templates, and you cannot add your own like you can with the other two devices I mentioned. You can add PDFs, but these don't live with your notes. I also can't change a template mid-notebook; doing so changes the template on all pages. The software pen is only a pen; no pencils or other brushes besides a highlighter. And lastly, while the Kindle has folders, you cannot add sub-folders, which is a real organizational problem. You also cannot edit notes like you can on other devices in this class; cutting, copying, pasting, and resizing notes just doesn‚Äôt exist.Handwriting-to-text conversion, a feature I don't really use, isn't present either, but isn't a deal-breaker to me. Searching notes would be really nice, though.I recognize Amazon may not see this as competition to the rM and Boox devices, but they should. I don't want to own multiple e-ink notebooks, and they have the power here to make me not have to choose. I am tempted to return it, though I will really miss not being able to annotate my books. Already that's something I enjoy, but I am not convinced yet that this is worth almost $400 to be able to do.Maybe it's worth holding on to in case they make really big improvements to the note-taking experience, but when I think back to the Echo and its promise, I am wary. That software has not only failed to improve, it's become worse over time. These devices are portals to spending on Amazon, and I fear that really improving the notebook software has no bottom-line justification for them besides maybe selling more devices. But maybe that should be the goal.

This is obvious in both bright sunlight and on an overcast day when held side by side2) somehow despite the same resolution text on Oasis looks sharper (I think even my attached photo conveys this)3) very heavy, weighs the same as 11‚Äù iPad! I wish the battery was 2 times smaller as anyone can have a power bank at hand if neededbut nobody can take half the battery out to make it easier to hold esp with one hand4) the bezel is grey compared to the black one on Oasis and the black one is so much nicer, much more pleasant to read with5) does not work faster than Oasis6) last time I checked the handwritten notes made on Scribe are not visible on Oasis and Kindle iPad app",One person found this helpful
"Introducing Kindle Scribe (16 GB), the first Kindle for reading and writing, with a 10.2‚Äù 300 ppi Paperwhite display, includes Basic Pen",4.0,"75% Kindle, 25% Notes - You can't compare this to a Remarkable","Reviewed in the United States on December 6, 2022",Option: Basic Pen | Setup: 16 GB | Offer Type: Without Kindle Unlimited,True,"This is absolutely as good as it gets when it comes to the Kindle E-reader line. It's got a large screen,  the warm and cool backlighting, the easy controls and access to amazing book downloads.With regards to note taking, it is a glorified post-it note.  If you read and take notes on what you read,  that's perfectly fine. For someone like me who uses the note-taking/editing, drawing capabilities for work, this comes up really short.  This can easily be solved with a few software updates but I'm very worried that Amazon won't put a dedicated team on constantly providing new updates and capabilities.  But without these updates you are literally just jotting notes on a post-it and it goes nowhere.The Remarkable is much more refined and it is no wonder given a dedicated team that does nothing but listen to feedback to create new features... for as long as I've had it they've regularly sent updates. It does a whole lot more now than when I first purchased 2 yrs ago.What it needs:Organization - you can create folders for your notes, but you cannot send a pdf to yourself and put in a folder. It is treated as if it were media and the only option you have is to place in a collection with your other books. Notebooks are separate from your Library and right now function as two different places on the Scribe. Yet your Recent Items list everything whether it is a book or a note. It's difficult to navigate when there is so little you can do to organize and display your files the way you want. Sometimes there is no way to rename files or list them by date modified - another issue. And so far, I don't see a way to easily navigate large files.Communication - this device was definitely not designed with a working professional in mind. Keep in mind that you have to go to your Amazon account to add authorized email addresses to be able to receive PDF files. You do get a web browser with the Scribe (Remarkable doesn't have it) but it is a dumbed down version. You can barely see the black and white text and it won't work with checking email or many other sites because it has no Javascript. It also has no way of exchanging docs or saving docs to a cloud such as Dropbox and Google Drive. All of this makes it difficult to collaborate with others.Drawing - I don't know if this is a pressure sensitive screen but there aren't any drawing tools on the Scribe nor layering.Overall, the Scribe is very much like the first version of Remarkable, it took notes and that was it.  Over the years being able to integrate the Remarkable into other parts of my life as well as using it for work is what really justified the price tag for me.  The Kindle right now is still just a Kindle with ability to scribble. I hope in time this changes but I'm worried it will be a slow process.",28 people found this helpful
"Introducing Kindle Scribe (16 GB), the first Kindle for reading and writing, with a 10.2‚Äù 300 ppi Paperwhite display, includes Basic Pen",4.0,Great for my uses of reading and writing notes. Better Software / App Store would make it amazing.,"Reviewed in the United States on December 9, 2022",Option: Basic Pen | Setup: 16 GB | Offer Type: Without Kindle Unlimited,True,"I purchased this to replace my 8 year old basic Kindle for reading. I was also considering other ""e-note"" devices for taking notes during meetings, etc. But wanted one device for both. The Kindle Scribe came along at the perfect time! It excels at both of those tasks. Reading is better than my old Kindle. And the writing is fantastic. It feels great like writing on paper. Marking up PDFs has been a great experience (Note that PDF's must be unprotected to be able to write on). I even loaded on some PDF crossword puzzles that have been a joy to do on the Scribe in my spare time.One key use for me that could use some improvement is newspapers and magazines. I tried the Kindle subscriptions for my local paper and magazines and the experience is terrible, like a black and white website from the 1990s. Plus it is more expensive than a regular paper subscription. However, I have started downloading a PDF of the newspaper and some magazines I already have (paper) subscriptions to and that is better but not perfect. You do have to ""pinch and zoom"" on the Kindle to navigate it. Though, the magazine pages show up pretty well on the Scribe's large screen.The Scribe has replaced the regular paper notebooks I keep notes in without a hitch. I also like that it will be able to more easily maintain an archive of notes that I can digitally refer back to. However, OCR to covert handwriting to text would be a huge benefit. The Scribe's pen & highlighter options work well and are more than enough for me and taking notes. However, I am far from an artist and think those that want to draw with this may find it lacking.Glad to have the large screen and USB-C charging but there are some hardware improvements from other recent Kindles that I hope to find in the next Scribe. Specifically waterproofing and wireless charging. I also hope they bring the stylus to a smaller version of the Kindle as well. There are benefits to the larger screen but I am also used to keeping smaller notebooks around and being able to fit my Kindle in a large jacket pocket. But overall the hardware is great: very think and solid feeling with great battery life.The software is the biggest opportunity for improvement on the Scribe. Amazon has an amazing chance to both solve these software short comings around things like drawing or reading newspapers and revolutionize the ""e-paper"" device industry by giving Kindle it's own App Store. Kindle needs special app store different from Apple, Android, or even most web pages. Built for e-ink display and stylus (no animations, color, limited processing power, etc). It would really add value to Kindle devices and allow creators to make apps focused on drawing, syncing documents, reading news, doing crossword puzzles and a million other things. Plus an app store would be a new revenue stream for Amazon and add functionality that would sell more devices.",5 people found this helpful
"Introducing Kindle Scribe (16 GB), the first Kindle for reading and writing, with a 10.2‚Äù 300 ppi Paperwhite display, includes Basic Pen",4.0,Big! Really BIG! But I like it.  Wish it had some features the lower-end Kindles have.,"Reviewed in the United States on December 10, 2022",Option: Premium Pen | Setup: 64 GB | Offer Type: Without Kindle Unlimited,True,"I just got a Kindle Scribe.  Holy crap but this thing is HUGE! It's bigger than my Galaxy Tab S6, and WAY bigger than my Kindle Oasis (which was the biggest Kindle since the 2009 Kindle DX).The Scribe is not just for reading, it comes with a pen that lets you write on the screen.  Currently you cannot mark up books, only insert sticky notes, but you can write on PDFs and it has a notebook function that includes lined pages, graph paper, agendas and calendars, to-do lists, and other functions.  The pen is extremely responsive, as good as my Galaxy Tab S6, and you could definitely use this for artwork (though only B&W, of course).I'm really enjoying it so far.  At first I wasn't sure about the gigantic screen, but it lets me run at a larger font and still have a decent amount of text on the page.  This makes reading much easier on my eyes.  The screen has the same kind of clarity I've come to expect from the Kindle, just a lot more of it.Battery life is INSANE.  I unplugged it yesterday morning, and since then I've read 1/4 of a novel (about 1-1/2 to 2 hours), messed around with the WiFi settings for about 15-20 minutes, played with the pen and set up a bunch of notebooks for about half an hour, and it's indexing the hundreds of books I sideloaded Thursday evening, and the battery is still at 93%. (Indexing used to murder the battery on my Oasis.)The premium leather cover looks way better than the so-called ""premium"" covers for the Oasis and Voyage which scratched very easily.  It attaches magnetically, and it looks like they fixed the attachment issues they had with the second gen Oasis magnetic covers.I do have a few complaints.  For some reason this highest-end and massively more expensive Kindle is missing a number of features found in the lower-end models.  It's not waterproof, which is stupid; only the base model Kindle isn't waterproof.  Unlike the Oasis it has no cellular option and there are no physical page turn buttons, even though it has more than enough room.  There's also no wireless charging like the Paperwhite Signature.  It also seems to have no support (yet) for WPA3 wireless security, which the Paperwhite has; this could be fixed with a software update.The price tag is OUCH, but I do a LOT of reading (on track for at least 60 books this year), so I'm willing to splurge on something I spend so much time using.  The e-ink screen is much easier on the eyes than a typical OLED tablet, and with the larger screen I can turn up the font size a bit and give my eyes a break.  I haven't tried it yet but it looks like some illustrated books and comics will be perfectly readable on the Scribe (though lacking in color, of course).",22 people found this helpful
"Introducing Kindle Scribe (16 GB), the first Kindle for reading and writing, with a 10.2‚Äù 300 ppi Paperwhite display, includes Basic Pen",4.0,Almost great for taking notes,"Reviewed in the United States on January 20, 2023",Option: Premium Pen | Setup: 64 GB | Offer Type: Without Kindle Unlimited,True,"I purchased the Scribe to take notes for work.  I abandoned paper and pen years ago, and have been using an iPad Pro + Apple Pencil 1 with OneNote.  That works well enough, and a matte screen protector helps makes it feel like writing on paper, but it's really only OK.So I went down the rabbit hole of e-ink tablets for notes.  Almost bought a reMarkable and an Onyx, then stumbled on to the Scribe.  I'm happy with it so far.  Here's why:The feel of writing is outstanding.  My penmanship is lacking.  I find my notes significantly more legible on the Scribe vs my iPad.Battery life is excellent.  To be expected with a device of this kind, but still a great benefit vs iPad.Screen is easy on the eyes.  Ability to adjust warmth and brightness is a plus.So why not five stars?I don't love the file management.  Needs another level of subfolders for how I work.  I'd also like a way to jump directly to Notebooks home page.I'd prefer that it just scroll vertically as you need a new page, but the Scribe is true to notebook form in making you ""turn the page"" top add more notes. The problem with this is moving your hand down the page while you write.  Not a big deal, but I'd rather be able to control where my hand is positioned.Don't like that sleep mode kicks in after some period of inactivity.  No way to disable that, which is apparently a long-standing customer gripe with these devices.Not really a complaint, but I'd love to see just a faint bit of color for the highlighter.  I knew it didn't have that going in, but I am really surprised how much I miss it.The cons are generally minor, and the key pro - the note-taking capability - is outstanding, so it's a strong four star review.  It also is exceptional for reading.  No shock there. I really can't stand the various options to buy books on Amazon  though, which is why my old Kindle has been untouched in a drawer for many months, and why I'll likely not read much on the Scribe.",2 people found this helpful

Everything else - is a compromise. And this would be fine, expcept for the fact that its price with good quality leather cover is comparable with fully functional tablets with color responsive screens etc.For example, I still cannot read Kindle ebooks available on Kindle for PC, whic is bad. But I can listen to audiobooks through bluetooth earphones (like Airpods), which is good, however there are no built-in dynamics, as well as dedictaed physical volume button, which is strange.The size is actually quite big, ideally to have one comapct e-reader (like Kindle Voyage) and one full size like this, for different situations and purposes. By the way, regrettably unlike Kindle Voyage, Scribe doesn't have cellular connection, only Wi-Fi, the reason for which (given the size of the gadget and market poisoning as a note taker) is not clear.Anyway, will be waiting for 2nd gen.",

The 1 star missing is for the lacking of note taking functions which hopefully can be addressed by software updates in future by Amazon.It's a high quality Kindle, better than my Oasis. It has good battery life according to the spec (I have just received it today). It's bright enough to read comfortably even in a dark room. It's similar to my old Kindle, but the navigation is slightly different. E.g. you don't see the documents in their own tab but you can choose the type to filter it. I didn't buy a cover because I like it thin. My Oasis cover made it too heavy. Without any cover, Kindle Scribe has the right amount of thickness and weight. I plan to just use some sleeves when transporting it and I'd mostly use it at home due to its size and weight.One big problem is it's hard to move to a particular page by dragging the progress bar. It's so hard to do that especially when you are at the end of a book. But it's there, just hidden. While on old Kindle, it appeared when you called out the menu. I don't know why they have a new UI like this. Clearly a regression.Additionally, you can use it to note taking. People said it's better than using an iPad/Tablet. It's about the same - I have Samsung Galaxy S pen with my phones too. You don't need the Scribe just for note taking if you've already had one of those. But still, Scribe's note taking is smooth and worked well. If you have Scribe, you don't need to buy a Galaxy S pen.In some cases the pen is not calibrated - the strokes appeared 1/4"" higher than your pen after you close and re-enter. But if you start writing far below, the problem is gone. I believe there may be other bugs.Missing functions: you can only do one level of folders but it's not a big deal if Amazon can fix it in future. No OCR is a big feature missing. And you can't really write along the pages of books, not even on Amazon owned books. People say you can do so with PDFs. I wasn't able to. Still, with the price I'm happy - just use it as a separate note taking device.If one day Amazon adds the OCR feature, I will change the rating to 5.

Nutshell: this thing is ‚Äúok‚Äù, but it doesn't really do what I was hoping it would do (yet).It‚Äôs comfortable to use.  Super fast user interface response.  Writing with the ""Premium Pen"" is good and comfortable.  Display is great, and just like all similar devices, it has a slight ‚Äúhazy glare‚Äù when viewed at certain angles to a light source.Adding notes to a Kindle book is relatively easy to do (it makes sense once you figure out how to do it).I'm giving this a 2 star review because it feels like it‚Äôs the first version of this product, and it still has a LOT of CRITICAL features that need to be added for it to fully compete with the other ‚Äúe-ink style digital tablets‚Äù on the market.Below are some thoughts, criticisms, and feature requests:1.  I cannot sync and read my notebooks, notes, or highlights on my computer.  The only exporting option is emailing each Notebook to myself, one at a time. This is NOT a solution in 2023.2.  I uploaded a work-related PDF to the Scribe, and then made highlights to the text.  I cannot view those highlights on my computer!  They are forever locked on my kindle.  This is NOT a solution in 2023.3.  I cannot write in the margin on that uploaded PDF.  One can only make highlights and add notes.  This is NOT a solution in 2023.4.  I cannot EDIT my notes on my computer.  You can only email a PDF copy to yourself.  That‚Äôs it.  Think of this as a tool that replaces pen and paper, and you can scan a copy of your notes.  This is NOT a solution in 2023.5.  I cannot sync my notes to my Google Workspace, Microsoft OneDrive, Dropbox, Box, OneNote, Evernote, Notion, etc.  The competitors do this today.  If this is remotely important to you, then look elsewhere!6.  No ‚ÄúHandwriting Conversion‚Äù feature.7.  Move ‚Äúnote objects‚Äù.  I'd love to be able to select an ""object"" that I have written and move, scale, or rotate it.8.  Brushes?9.  Layers?10.  Share screen/presentation on a Zoom meeting.  The competitors do this today.  If this is important to you, then look elsewhere.11.  Pen is NOT pressure sensitive.  The competitors do this today.  If this is important to you, then look elsewhere.12.  Pen is NOT ‚Äútilt sensitive‚Äù.  The competitors do this today.  If this is important to you, then look elsewhere.13.  I needed to relocate some of my overhead room lighting to accommodate the slight glare on the screen (but I would have needed to do this regardless of tablet chosen).14.  Printing notes (or an annotated PDF) requires emailing the document.15.  Cannot make subfolders of Notebooks (WTH!?!?).  You can only organize documents one level deep.16.  It doesn't remember the sort ""state"".  For example, I want to sort the notebook folders by name‚Ä¶ and the folder contents by date.17.  Infinite canvas paper.  How cool would that be!18.  No icons or indicators on the Notebooks, Folders, or UI, indicating Notebooks have been synced and successfully backed up.19.  Only 8 items fit on a screen in the Notebook ‚Äúview‚Äù regardless of Grid or List view.  One has to scroll down a page because the screen layout User Interface wasn't thought out properly.  There are no settings to adjust the size of the icons.  The List view is, amazingly, just as useless.20.  Can't change the delay time to lock the screen.  I'm sitting in a meeting, listening to a speaker... I look down to take some notes... and it's already locked.On average, Amazon‚Äôs documentation, tutorials, and videos, are NOT their strongest skill set.  If I were in charge of Amazon‚Äôs Kindle Scribe Documentation Team, then I would suggest that they look towards Apple, AWS, or Google for some inspiration.I love being an early adopter, yet knowing what I know now‚Ä¶ I would probably not buy this.  I recommend this only for early adopters who really ONLY want a Kindle reader with some extra functionality to take an occasional note or two.Unfortunately, the Kindle Scribe really doesn't solve the problem that I was hoping that it would.  One of my friends has a rather ""remarkable"" competing product, and insists that I try that one instead.

"Introducing Kindle Scribe (16 GB), the first Kindle for reading and writing, with a 10.2‚Äù 300 ppi Paperwhite display, includes Basic Pen",4.0,Samsung S-Pen compatible,"Reviewed in the United States on December 22, 2022",Option: Premium Pen | Setup: 32 GB | Offer Type: Without Kindle Unlimited,True,"As the headline suggests, this is compatible with Samsung  S-Pens, both ways. The Kindle Scribe pen is compatible with S-Pen compatible devices (tested on S22 Ultra and Galaxy Tab S6 Lite) and S-Pens are compatible with this device. So, that's cool.As to the actual device, I'm divided. It's expensive. Not as expensive as competitors who offer similar features, perhaps, but it is definitely the most expensive Kindle on offer. I also have an Oasis, I had a Voyage, and I had several other lower-end Kindles over the years. This larger format is heavier and obviously larger than anything other Kindle currently available. For non-fiction work I love the size. Pictures and diagrams and other non-text items really work well on this device. The normal text is clear and you get to see a lot of it at once. The pen works well. It feels every bit the high-end device it wants to be.But... for basic novel reading, I feel it's too big and too heavy. I prefer my Oasis, hands down. The smaller and lighter form-factor is simply more convenient all around. For non-fiction works, I prefer the Scribe without a doubt. Frankly it's similar to a hardcover vs. softcover debate in this respect. The Scribe is the hardcover version of a Kindle. Yes, it feels premium, but it's less fun to read in bed.The color temperature of the lighting is the big selling point for both the Oasis and the Scribe to me. It really does make a huge difference. But there's a couple of things about the Scribe that annoy me. The most major is the cut out for the USB-C port. It feels sharp around the edges and it's in a place that my hand wants to sit. It's not a major problem, but it's something I notice every time I pick up my Scribe. The other thing is the ergonomics. The Oasis has a weird shape, but it's grippy once you get used to it. The Scribe could use a shape similar due to its weight and overall size. Finally, the battery life is just okay. For a device this size, a day's worth of reading shouldn't hit the battery so hard. Yes, it holds a charge for weeks when you're not using it just like all e-ink devices, bit when actively reading it seems to drain unexpected fast.Overall, I give it a 3.5 to 4 out of five. It's a very nice device, and I won't be returning it, but it needs a little polish and for people who just read novels I don't think it's better than the Oasis, even with the pen. For those who read non-fiction with pictures and diagrams, or those who want to draw on their PDFs, it's a great device.",5 people found this helpful

The lighting is perfect and EVEN (even the last two Oases can't quiiite claim that), the size is fantastic for both reading and writing, and the writing ability is just tops. I'm already learning more in my programming training courses because I'm excited to hand-write notes again, which I haven't been in a long time. And I love the fountain pen option, which somehow makes my lousy handwriting pretty. On a side note, I can understand why earlier reviews complained about bare-bones writing functionality, as I was able to use the kindle both before and after a recent update that added more features, so take earlier reviews with a tiny grain of salt. They were justified at the time but not quite as accurate now.In any case. I highly, highly recommend this kindle and I'm very much looking forward to future versions of it, so I hope there's a 2.0 on the horizon someday!P.S. Pro-tip that I learned from another review: there's some awesome Kindle scribe templates available for purchase and download from various sellers on Etsy that can add some fun things like brain games/mazes/word searches, or productivity options like customizable day planners, complete with functional hyperlinks to allow for easy navigation within the document.

I've gotta say, the more I use this one, the better I like it. I read a lot, and I love being able to jot notes about the books as I read. And I don't have any paper to deal with. I usually end up with notes scribbled all over my little note pad, but I only have to keep up with my Scribe since I can take the same notes here. I can even highlight text that stands out to me. If I want to just take notes like you would in a notebook or journal, I can do that too. Battery life just goes on and on, which was a big surprise. I knew it was advertised as better, but dang! The battery life surprised me. I also like the ability to set it so the current book cover is the screen saver. I'm anxious to see how updates enhance an already great device. Honestly, the only thing I'd like to see soon is the text to speech option. It does read the text on the screen, which is under the accessibility options, but actual text to speech would be nice so I don't have to double tap my way through everything.

Much better that listening to pseudo intellectuals from Youtube or cat videos on TicTok. My daughter got an Oasis for Christmas to read on the go and it is great but I wanted something larger. The Scribe is simply fantastic for books, (Amazon please let us take notes directly on the page!) The large screen Is wonderful to read and the high ppi makes images and text look crisp. The battery is crazy too, I charged it on the day it arrived 1/8/23 and it still has 30% left (2/9/23). It isn't as optimized for pdf as I would like but maybe this can get better with updates. Screen brightness never leaves me wanting for more light and auto adjusting brightness works well. All aluminum case feels premium however slippery to hold, I added a carbon vinyl cling to give it more texture.If you are like me with an overflowing bookshelf and want something to replace the physical books look no further. The Scribe is a fantastic device for reading and taking SOME notes. Note taking is adequate but the lack of being able to mark directly on the page of your book is a silly omission. Water resistance would have been nice too. All in all I love my Scribe, I can curl up with a book in the dark or bright sun with my entire library with dictionary.

"Introducing Kindle Scribe (16 GB), the first Kindle for reading and writing, with a 10.2‚Äù 300 ppi Paperwhite display, includes Basic Pen",4.0,Skeptical at first but pleasantly surprised!,"Reviewed in the United States on February 3, 2023",Option: Premium Pen | Setup: 32 GB | Offer Type: Without Kindle Unlimited,True,"I've been a long time fan of the Kindle product line. In 2013, I bought my first paperwhite for college and it was the best tool I could've bought to save me on backpack weight. Moving up a few years, I purchased a Kindle Oasis in 2020. I loved the Oasis but like many others, the battery life was just okay and it left me wanting a few more features from it, like annotation. Fast-forward to 2023, I see the scribe has come out and I decided to pick it up on a trial basis. So far, I'm a big fan! First things to start off with, my likes: really like how smooth it is to write in the journal tool. I use this for work these days as a way to save paper. It's been really nice and I honestly think it writes better than the iPad does. Feels more responsive and also feels like I'm writing on paper itself which is really nice. I do enjoy reading books on the scribe too- feels like I'm reading an actual full size book which is a nice feature. The annotation tool is decent as well. So far, no complaints tied to that and it's fairly easy to get to. Battery life is decent as well. Purchased on Jan 11th and haven't had to charge it since that first week. I use my Scribe a few hours a day, little to no screen brightness so that probably helps on the battery life preservation.The dislikes? the scribe is a bit on the heavy side so can get tiring to hold for reading so I think I'll be holding on to my oasis for the time being for my main e-reader. Additionally, I do find it is sometimes a little harder to do highlights on books I'm reading.All in all, a great little device with some room to grow but I'm a fan so far!",One person found this helpful

I struggled with a 3 or 4 star rating because the writing features are so very basic but ultimately went with 4 stars because it is just an absolute pleasure to read on. I honestly bought it for the writing component and didn‚Äôt anticipate reading much in it.  I do my reading on my Kindle Paperwhite.  Well, now the only time I use my Paperwhite is when I am laying in bed, the Scribe is a little bulky to read in bed becaus of the size.I have the premium pen and have enjoyed the writing experience.  It feels great, and is easy to use.  I mainly do some light journaling, work on math homework with my children, and take notes for my job.  There is a very limited selection of pen types/styles and the pressure sensitivity seems to not really do much with the darkened or lightness of the pen stroke. I have saw that Amazon is supposed to be doing an update to add some new stuff, but at this price point which I think is quite high, I will only consider what the device is and can do, not what it could be or could do.I wouldn‚Äôt hesitate to recommend this to current kindle users that are in the Amazon/Kindle ecosystem already, but if someone is looking for just a note taking device, I‚Äôm not sure this is the one when you consider the alternatives out there with much more robust features.  If I wasn‚Äôt an avid reader already familiar with Kindles, I would probably be fairly disappointed.  Overall, I have enjoyed my experience so far and hope it will continue to improve with updated over the coming months.",One person found this helpful
"Introducing Kindle Scribe (16 GB), the first Kindle for reading and writing, with a 10.2‚Äù 300 ppi Paperwhite display, includes Basic Pen",4.0,"Great device, but some of the software functionality could use some work","Reviewed in the United States on January 11, 2023",Option: Premium Pen | Setup: 32 GB | Offer Type: Without Kindle Unlimited,True,"Overall, it's a great device for journaling and for reading. My intent to replace my scratch paper and post-it notes was a success! Just as a preface, I primarily use this device for the following things:-To-do lists and calendars-Referencing documents (PDFs) for work-Sketching flow charts for programming-Reading / Writing sheet music-Light readingSo far I have had a great experience with the device and it does exactly what I need to do. Having more writing templates and other methods of transferring notes would be nice, but it's not a deal breaker. I do, however, have four minor grievances with the device:1. On night mode, the eraser sometimes leaves ""residue"" in notebooks once something has already been erased. To explain further, the handwriting from before will be there, but at 80-85% transparency. This seems to be a software issue, so I hope to see this remedied in the near future.2. Night mode has difficulty understanding the difference between images and text in some pdfs. It is uncommon, but on a couple of my pdfs, the Scribe tried to invert the background without the sheet music, making it black on black, thus nearly impossible to read.3. I wish that the Premium Pen eraser was more sensitive; I have to press relatively hard to get the eraser to respond (which is NOT the case with the pen part of the stylus). The standard pen may be better about this feature, but sometimes I worry that I am scratching the screen when I am erasing. I have not damaged the device yet, but I try to be pretty careful about how I use touchscreens.4. Not being able to take notes in ePub documents is slightly annoying; I know that sticky notes should replace this feature, but there is something about writing directly in a document that is satisfying. Seeing as PDFs have this feature, this would not be a difficult thing to add.Again, this device does exactly what I need it to do (and more), but some of the minor bugs in night mode and the pen are something to note for future users. After a couple of software patches, I would HIGHLY recommend this to anyone who uses it for the same things I do!",

And this delivers that pretty well.  I haven't figured out how to insert a note like the screen shows, but can open a note pad and write notes on things I am reading on my other kindle e-reader. So that is still valuable.What is an issue however, is this can get into a snit and not allow you to advance pages (turn the page). I have to restart it often. It does bring you back to where you left off, but it would be nice if a person didn't have to restart in the first place.  The only other thing that would be nice is if we could highlight in color.  But I imagine that then the whole product would have to be in color.  Maybe the next upgrade?  I absolutely love that I can upload in pdf to it though from the Amazon link- this feature is great for people who have to do a lot of reading research.  And that is why I got it.  Hopefully, when the next gen comes out all of our notes will transfer with our library and we will get a discount for the 1st gen model.  So if you are college student that needs to do a lot of research and taking notes to produce a thesis, masters thesis or PhD- this is a pretty good tablet to use.",One person found this helpful

I'm not a huge touch screen Kindle fan. After the first Paperwhite came out, I loved the front-lit screen.  My fantasy Kindle was a Dx with front-lit screen and page turn buttons.  I didn't buy the Oasis right away. I did finally buy a used one on eBay. I loved having page turn buttons again. The K3 was one of my favorites.  Then I did buy a new 7"" Oasis. This became my favorite Kindle. My first was the K2 with Sprint back in early 2009. When I saw the ad for the new Kindle Scribe, I had to pre-order it. It was almost my fantasy Kindle. I didn't get it for the writing feature,  but it does write like paper. For those that like to make notations in books, this is definitely the Kindle for you.I love the bigger screen which translates to less page turns. So I don't have to tap the screen for page turns as much. The light is not quite as bright as the 7"" Oasis, but there is more real estate to illuminate.  It's still lit pretty well.  I also, for the first time, got a wifi only model. All my other Kindles have the cellular option.  That was because I couldn't access the wifi at work or didn't have wifi hot spot option for my cell phone.I also got the premium pen option.  It does write like paper,  and it erases easily and completely.  Another option I wish Amazon had was for automatic page turns. I used to use the text to speech option and turn down the volume.  So when I use it while on one of my exercise machines,  I don't have to keep pushing or taping to turn the page. This reduces the risk of knocking my Kindle off the stand and possibly breaking it.So Amazon,  if you are listening,  add page turn buttons and an auto page turn feature.  Then it truly would be the perfect Kindle.  I still highly recommend this one. You'll love the bigger size. Especially if you were a fan of the Dx.",2 people found this helpful

As a homeschool teacher and as someone who has to work with a child on the spectrum with speech pathology/articulation and occupational therapy, it helped so much. I bought the Fintie case and bought some adhesive patches and Lego dots adhesive patches to make my own kindle case look the way I want it to. I added a picture showing how you can hide the toolbar since a previous review stated you couldn't. The scribe comes with 18 templates. But I use Etsy and you can actually buy different kinds of templates with the hyperlinks. I also use Weeble, Twinkl, TeachersPayTeachers and other sites where I can download  pdfs  or writing templates as well as occupational therapy activities. With the scribe I was able to create my own graphic organizers and activities using this the built in templates. I was able to email those templates and once I opened them on my laptop. I uploaded and saved the pdf notebook document  and the templates I made were more permanent that way. Just wished they had the choice to add a hyperlink. I love the graphic organizers but just wished they had more. They should have a wide variety of brushes and a way to add more graphic organizers for writing, drawing, creativity, math and science. My neice uses the scribe for many pen control activities. It would be great if Amazon could create a KindleScribe+ where customers can pay a monthly or yearly amount to access 1000s of unlimited templates, customizable templates. and books, textbooks, pen control and bilateral workbooks as well as workbooks that you can write in. This would be good for so many kids who struggle with Pen Control.. You cannot write on any books nor highlight them unfortunately. You can only use sticky notes. So far, I would say there's room for improvement but I cannot be negative about the scribe because Amazon has never sold nor created an eInk Notebook Kindle that you can journal and read. I know they will come up with major updates and improvements with the software. So far, with its built in templates, created writing templates with the graphic organizers, word ladders, bilateral activities, tracing activities, speech sequencing activities, vocabulary and writing templates. Like I said, I found a way to make my own work templates using the templates that come already with the scribe,  more permanent so when my niece uses them, the surrounding part of the template won't be erased. I also can upload any pdfs I create for school. I was able to access many editable and compatible pdf files for my scribe including math workbooks.",9 people found this helpful

With a 300ppi screen that's backlit with warmth adjustment, it offers a delightful reading/writing experience.Prior to purchasing this device, I used to jot down my notes by hand on a Samsung tablet while simultaneously reading books on my Paperwhite. Unfortunately, a significant drawback of this approach was that I had to manually transcribe the relevant portions of the book text onto my tablet, rather than merely highlighting the text. However, I can now effortlessly highlight a word or sentence and instantly begin writing notes, all while it automatically saves the note to the exact text I highlighted. This feature has revolutionized my reading and writing experience and has been an absolute pleasure to use.I'm delighted that Amazon is introducing new features and functionalities for people who are searching for an E-Ink notebook.

I am worried I will sit on it in the car and bend/break it.2) It has no buttons, which I really dislike. The touch sensitivity is great when you're directly engaged with it, but it's frustrating when you're sitting to eat.3) No pressure sensitivity on the pen? What? That's absolutely bizarre in the current world.4) I preordered the device and the case won't arrive for another month. Keeping the pen with the device by magnets only is frustrating to say the least.It's a big Kindle; it checks all the boxes I want:1) Big, high DPI screen2) Cool/Warm LED shift3) Absolutely ludicrous battery time (same as other Kindles - no Android, which can be a downside, but boots super fast and keeps a charge for months)4) Super thin, super light5) Very, very responsive page turning and display refreshing (not the biggest must-have, but definitely great-to-have)I should also note the device came with 4 months of free Kindle Unlimited, which I accepted but which I am unsure I will use (I have eclectic reading tastes).I also own:Kindle Paperwhite (great but too small for my eyes now)Boox Nova3 Color (smaller, poor screen, takes too long to boot, thick and heavy, feels non-premium - but has color and note taking!)Kindle Oasis (perfect device except it's a bit too small. The buttons are great, I wish the Scribe had these buttons)Samsung Tab S8+ (not e-ink, but my favorite tablet ever made)iPad Pro 11"" (again not e-ink, wonderful device but I don't like the iOS ecosystem very much)I really hate to emphasize marketing, but there was an insert in the Scribe box that had a quote from Robert Louis Stevenson - ""I kept always two books in my pocket, one to read, one to write in."" Which more or less perfectly describes my use case - I'm a computer programmer, and I like to read when I eat, and I like to take notes throughout the day when they occur to me. I strongly prefer to hand write notes, but I will use other means if necessary. I need a backlight to not disturb my wife's sleep, but I like it to be warm/cool depending on the time of day. My eyes get really bad at night because of my work and I like the larger device. The Kindle ecosystem is good but doesn't really sway me one way or the other.Edit: I should note, I do not write in books, and I have never written in books. If you are specifically looking to write inside your books, this probably isn't for you as many other reviews show it's a difficult and frustrating process. I imagine this will likely be fixed in software as time goes on, but currently days after release, it's not a great experience. This doesn't matter to me personally but it could be a game changer for you. The other items I mentioned above matter more to me, and they make this a Really Great Purchase. It can (and should) absolutely be improved, but I don't currently see a better option available on the market.",42 people found this helpful

The ability to search notes using OCR.The ability to skip pages when looking back through notes.  It stinks that you have to swipe page by page to get back to the beginning.

There are some noticeable flaws to it however.Most notably is that the touch screen has some dead zones as well as certain areas it isn't super precise. The right top and bottom corners do not work with the pen so if you are writing and then get to those spots nothing shows up which is annoying. There are also certain zones less specific where when you are writing where the pen is and where the ink/writing shows up is does not match very well so it gets a bit sloppy looking. This is annoying for my needs which is mostly writing text and drawing chemical structures, but I imagine it would get increasingly annoying if you were drawing and couldn't get the details you want.Eventually it would be awesome if you could directly add files to your Kindle Scribe by a USB C cable instead of having to upload to Amazon's website and then send them over, which many commenters have noted could be a security/privacy issue.Ultimately I would also like it if they could get the device compatible with Microsoft Office so you could look at and edit PowerPoints and Word documents, like competitors are able to do.I have heard that some of these fixes are on the way, but until it happens I won't hold my breath.If there were additional pen tips or settings to increase the precision of the pen this would be a no brainer purchase. As is there is a little to be desired when it comes to the level of detail in the writing/drawing you can do.Although that all may seem a bit negative I do like this product and am happy with the purchase. I have wanted a large Kindle like this to read and mark up PDFs for years and this does the job really well. The battery life is fantastic even with extensive use and I am excited to see how this product gets improved upon in the future.I moved it down from four to three stars after using it extensively for a couple more weeks. The spots on the screen that have lessened sensitive. My next tablet like this will probably be a competitor like the Remarkable 2 as it has the ability to work with Microsoft Office and turn written notes to text so you can easily share them and all around seems like a more functional tablet.",

At home, I read paper books, but it's inconvenient to carry several books on a long trip. I was a good candidate for the Kindle Scribe. I save many pdf documents to read later, and I like to scribble and underline, circle and annotate them as if they were paper. I bought the Kindle Scribe to try on my current trip, three weeks in Iceland, that I loaded with my yet-to-read books and over twenty pdfs downloaded from a variety of sites. It's been magical! I'm able to read, mark up, save, share the ones I want to keep and delete from the device when the content isn't worth keeping. I love the size, larger than my other Kindle devices I traded in for a discount on the hefty price of the Scribe with the premium pen. It's been easy to read all my pdfs, and don't miss the photos, adverts, and other visually distracting illustrations. I only care about the text. My one complaint, and the reason I didn't give the Scribe a five-star rating, is that the downloaded pdfs are listed as WebPage Unknown, so I have no idea what the pdfs contain and I haven't found a way to enter the title. This is problematic for those pdfs I want to save for later reference. I do wish in a future iteration there will be a way to title the pdf I don't discard. Other than that, I'm very happy with the device and highly recommend it.UPDATE: Still love the device, the ability to send PDFs from browser searches and research materials. But the inability to title the PDF is problematic, especially when I have several research papers I can't tag or otherwise label unless I create a separate album. This is not particularly helpful if some of the PDFs are, say, memoir essay, or short story, or the three research studies by the same author about different subjects but related to the same concern. I hope the ability to search the PDFs easier, if only, to allow us to title it other than Website.",One person found this helpful
"Introducing Kindle Scribe (16 GB), the first Kindle for reading and writing, with a 10.2‚Äù 300 ppi Paperwhite display, includes Basic Pen",3.0,Not an Oasis but I like the screen,"Reviewed in the United States üá∫üá∏ on March 23, 2023",Option: Basic Pen | Setup: 16 GB | Offer Type: Without Kindle Unlimited,True,"I own an Oasis, figured I'd upgrade to the Scribe, so I bought one. I work from home and rarely ever travel. I'm home almost every day all day. A larger, heavier, more cumbersome e-reader sure sounded good in my head. I mean, gosh, that larger screen is so appealing. I went back to the Oasis after 1 day.During my first reading session with the scribe, the weight of it became uncomfortable after a short while. I think this is due to how the weight is distributed more than how much it actually weighs. Yes, the Scribe is roughly 2-point-something times heavier than the Oasis but the Oasis is really light, so it didn't seem like that big of a deal. Well... Since the weight of the oasis is mostly on the grip side where you hold it, and where the buttons are, it gives it this feeling of being extraordinarily light. It's just extremely optimized for one-handed use. I feel like a larger Oasis, with roughly the same design of the current Oasis, would feel better than the scribe.To top it off, my cat spends almost all her time laying on me, pawing at me, headbutting me, etc so the moment I sit down she's already in my lap. I'm so used to being able to maneuver my Oasis around easily with 1 hand while continuing to read and turn pages so that I can use my free hand to appease my cat, drink my hot beverage, eat snacks, or whatever else that I was sorely missing that feature almost instantly. By the end of the that reading session I was just wishing my Scribe were a larger version of my Oasis.My second session later that night was in bed and again, it was just far more cumbersome and tiring to use there as well. Like earlier, I found myself just wishing my Scribe were my Oasis.I really wanted a larger screen but I just can't. I'm spoiled by the Oasis now these last 2 years. I couldn't give a crap about the pen, it was never a selling point for me. I've returned the Scribe and will continue to use my Oasis until hopefully a newer and bigger version of it comes out.",One person found this helpful

Sometimes in the midst of a book, I might suddenly think of something I need to do or buy. Sometimes there's an inspiration I want to make note of or a question I have. The Scribe has fit into my notating niche almost perfectly.There is one feature that is great in theory and lousy in execution. The bottom navigation available when you're on the Home, Library, Notebooks or More screen features in its center a quick return to the last item. This would be magnificent if it took me back to, say, the book I just left to make a quick notebook entry. But it doesn't. It goes to whatever you just closed. So when I close that notebook to go back to my book I can with one click reopen the notebook I just closed which is silly since not only did I close it because I was done, the act of closing it returns you to the Notebooks screen where it is available for a one click return as the most recent notebook I used. To get back to my book I have to click on either Home or Library and then click on my book.That being said, I put the device through its paces and found the battery life to be excellent. After giving it a full charge eight days ago I read 2-1/2 books, made copious notes, downloaded items and deliberately tried to keep the screen on as much as possible. I probably averaged at least six hours a day and possibly closer to eight. It currently stands at 23% battery. Nice!I'm also in love with its writing feel and the dedicated eraser on the premium pen. I've dabbled with other paperless notebooks and have never been happy with either the writing or erasing element or both. Now I can write and erase and store my notes to my heart's content.One criticism I had read prior to purchase regarded its lack of converting handwritten text to typed. Being a jotter this did not concern me. If I need my notes typed out, I probably want to re-write them a bit anyway. It does allow me to quickly send a PDF of my notes to another device via email. I've found this very helpful with delivering my shopping list to my phone in a manner that I can further mark up (strike through) and since it's in my own handwriting it is easier for me to read without cheaters than it would be if it were typed.Here's to the beginning of what will hopefully be a beautiful relationship.",One person found this helpful

A lot of people are complaining about not being able to write on actual pages of books but I don‚Äôt mind it. You can hand write sticky notes that go on the page where you want it and I prefer that over writing on the page anyways since it‚Äôs on a kindle.

They disappear after a refresh so it's probably just a software issue that will be resolved with time.The device is ""big"". It's wider than my 11"" ipad pro but just a bit shorter. The width is largely due to the bezel for holding it.It is a bit on the heavy side, but having adjusted to the ipad, I think it's just a matter of time / acclimation.Pros:It's a solid build -- the construction feels solid and sturdy.The bezel is actually quite useful for holding it. When I compare it to other devices, I routinely find myself trying to balance the device with my thumb along the edge. With the Scribe, you can hold it without activating any part of the screen.The backlight for both reading and writing is excellent! Other writing tablets don't have any backlight so you always need decent lighting to write. The kindle backlight solves this quite elegantly.The screen resolution is great for reading! I don't have a huge need for large format books, but this will easily satisfy any need in the future.Syncing is simple and easy. I drafted a notebook and without having to do anything, it was available on all of my other devices in the Kindle app. On my Supernote, I have to manually sync it which is a pain. And since I already have the Kindle app on other devices, this makes it super convenient to access my notes!The writing quality is nice and simple. This replaces pen and paper, so a lot of the features like converting to text, or moving text around are just nice to haves in my mind. It behaves pretty much like you would expect for a writing tablet :)Overall, I'm happy with the purchase and know that I'll get a lot of use out of it!",7 people found this helpful

Great to read a book, I can keep a lot of books in it, battery life is fantastic, love being able to make notes and keep them in folders.

I find the pen handy for navigating the interface and will use this device mainly for reading with note taking being only a minor feature for me. The magnets that hold the pen could be a lot stronger. I did get the recommended Amazon case, which frankly I dislike. If you hold the Kindle in the portrait orientation, the case flips up rather than to the side, the latter being my preference. I got the grey case and it has a mottled appearance, I guess this is intentional, but my preference would be for a solid color. The cases are the weakest part of all of the Kindles that I've owned. My preference for the Scribe would be a hard-case with a kickstand that is usable in both orientations. I feel that this product is way more expensive than it should be, but I do understand that we're closer to the beginning of the development of the E-Ink screens and hopefully prices will go down in the future. And it is a big and beautiful screen It would be nice if one could toggle the note widget on and off when in a book as it takes up more real estate on the screen than I care for.Update: After living with this for several months, I have grown used to the cover, which is just okay and that hopefully will have newer designs available at some point. I would prefer a hard case for it. Concerning some design points, for me, it would be more useful to have the power button on the top and the charging port on the bottom and centered. With as much real estate on the bezel, it would be nice to have page-forward and page-backward buttons on it ala the Oasis. The battery life has worked out to be pretty good, as it should be for this form-factor. And for heaven's sake, being that this device is pretty much a one-trick pony, adding a calculator app would be the icing on the cake and would work super with the pen.And in the bigger picture, there should be some type of app store for Kindles.",

In no true order it would be:+++ Search function in notepad similar to the abilities in ebooks, ie swipe up to view and scroll left and right through pages and by entering a page number+++ Adding pages in a notebook between pages, not just deleting+++ Folder structure that supporst multiple subfolders. This is a simple GUI representation of a location string. Being that this is a Linux based, a simple task programming wise (ask me how I know). Fork Scribe off as is the Fire tablet, it gets constant updates.+++ One touch switching between an open notepad and open doc/ebook+++ Multitasking where notepad is on one half of screen, an ebook/doc on the other. Not a novel idea. Been done.I feel copy/paste might should be on that list. Less important to me, but would be nice, should have been in the first iteration, definitely in that first update in December. And, then, pretty much everything everyone else says.

Not everyone likes big.  There are advantages of the larger size, but I realize what is bothering me about this.  It doesn‚Äôt feel personal.  I would love to be able to make annotations on a smaller screen.  It would feel more intimate. More private.  More portable.  If they would allow handwritten notes for audiobooks and make it smaller, I‚Äôd be over the moon.**Addendum12/27/22**After a few weeks of use, I am finding that there are advantages and disadvantages of this device.  It is NO iPad, so, no bells and whistles per se, no Goodnotes, or other note apps.  I am getting used to the handwritten notes, in fact, they are not quite in the way.  I don't have to sacrifice all of my Kindle ebook purchases in order to annotate.  I found that some of my books had to be updated to accept the sticky notes.I had to purchase a Cornell notebook from Etsy to have my favorite notebook paper, because I don't like ANY of the choices Amazon provided.For now, I say that the avid Kindle user that wants to annotate their vast collection of books can now do so.Needs:Sticky paper with lines and/or marginsCornell notebook paper (I had to purchase a Cornell Notebook from Etsy, don't  understand why because Cornell is the staple note taking paper for students)WHY USE GRAY HIGHLIGHTS??  IT DOESN‚ÄôT STAND OUT!STICKY NOTES FOR AUDIOBOOKS SHOULD HAVE HANDWRITING FUNCTION!!  Who can keep up typing notes? This is supposed to be a WRITING device!Sticky notes should be more visible on the page.  Too tiny to find.I‚Äôm hoping that these can be updated on THIS generation‚Ä¶don‚Äôt make us overspend. This really is overpriced for me to mention so many common sense needs.Bottom line is this also needs to be in color.

I'm a grad student and it's awesome for reading papers and taking notes.  They took away the annoying watermark which I was very pleased with.  I have a couple more suggestions for how they can make this device even better:1. I find that the display times out on me too quickly.  It would be nice if this were a setting you could adjust.2. An index card feature would be really cool.3. All of the things I mentioned before - A good desktop app for organizing library, option to scroll in notebooks, a copy tool for notetaking.ORIGINAL: Overall I like the device.  It feels and looks nice.  Writing on it is good.There are a couple features/tweaks I'd like to see in the future:1. It would be nice to be able to scroll in notebooks.  I do lots of math work, so if I have an equation at the bottom of a page, I need to go back and forth to copy it to the next page.  I'd really like to be able to just write one really long page.2. Relatedly, a tool where you can select a box, then copy whats in it to another page or notebook would be greatly appreciated.3. I'm super annoyed that when you export notebooks they put a kindle scribe watermark on it.  This was an expensive device.  I don't want to be used for advertising or whatever.4. The PC Send to Kindle app is terrible.  It really doesn't seem like a lot to ask for a nice desktop application with a good UI to organize folders and send lots of documents to the device.",

Omg this is the biggest one. We're limited to one template per notebook right now. Please please please update this, it would make my life so much better :)Original review:This device is pretty incredible, I love it so far. Reading is a delight on it, journaling, list taking, even sketching and drawing are a great experience. The writing toolbar (black circle) can be hidden so it's not always present on the screen, but the setting was not where I expected and I had to read the user manual to find it (when a book is open you open the quick menu and tap the three dots in the upper right corner, it's not in the settings at all).Complaints:-The power button and charging port are on the side of the device, so my hand easily catches on them. Not a big deal, probably better than on the top (which would turn into the bottom if you flipped the device, causing the button to be easily pushed by resting it against something). However, I wish it was on the thin side, not the thicker side where you naturally hold the device. Not sure if that would even be possible engineering-wise, but in a perfect world, amiright?-The device is quite a bit heavier than I expected. Again, not a big deal, and not even that surprising given the technology packed into the tiny space, but be prepared for more heft than other models.-The premium pen's button is not as customizable as I would like. Ideally, I would like the button to be customizable per document. In notebooks and PDFs I would like it to engage the highlighter, and in ebooks I would like it to create a sticky note, but whatever option you choose is across all document types. Being able to customize this more would allow me to hide the writing toolbar and not have to open it has often in certain documents. Theoretically, this should be able to be fixed easily with a software update, but I'm not a programmer so who is to say?Overall I definitely recommend this device!",3 people found this helpful
"Introducing Kindle Scribe (16 GB), the first Kindle for reading and writing, with a 10.2‚Äù 300 ppi Paperwhite display, includes Basic Pen",3.0,Not as good as the reMarkable 3,"Reviewed in the United States üá∫üá∏ on December 22, 2022",Option: Premium Pen | Setup: 32 GB | Offer Type: Without Kindle Unlimited,True,"I got this to compare to the reMarkable 3 that I already have and use religiously. In my opinion, one of the biggest downfalls of the reMarkable is that it does not support eBooks. In comes the Amazon Scribe boasting the same paper feel writing experience with eBook capabilities.The screen size between the two is about the same. The biggest difference is that the Scribe has a backlit screen. This can be a pro or a con depending on how you feel about it. For me, it takes away from the notebook feel of the tablet, but it makes it nice for reading at night. The screens feel different, with the Scribe being a smoother feel, like pen on stone paper.Both tablets have a good amount of options for templates on the pages and can be different templates on different pages of the same notebook. To-do lists, college ruled paper, schedules, calendars, etc. The reMarkable has more tools, however. The Scribe has the basic pen, highlighter, and eraser, and the toolbar sits in a really annoying spot on the screen. In comparison, the reMarkable has a ballpoint and a fine-point pen, a highlighter, a caligraphy pen, a marker, and a lasso tool, all with varying degrees of thickness available. The highlighter and pen tools can also be assigned different export colors, so when the document is exported colors can appear on the computer.Both tablets can have PDF documents sent to them but a huge downfall of the Scribe is the inability to export notebooks as PDFs by email. This is a feature I utilize a lot at work with my reMarkable, and it is one I am disappointed the Scribe does not have. Hopefully, it will come in a future software update.Another thing that the reMarkable does better than the Scribe is screen gestures. Pinch to zoom, one finger swipe down to close a document, and two finger swipe down to access the four most recently used documents are available only on the reMarkable. This makes navigating between documents more cumbersome on the Scribe.Notebooks can be organized similarly on both tablets utilizing folders to keep similar notebooks together. However, on the Scribe, you cannot place a folder within a folder. It was really nice to be able to have a ‚Äúmeetings‚Äù folder with a folder for the different types of meetings, but that is not available on the scribe. One other great organizational feature that the reMarkable has that the Scribe does not is the ability to see all pages in a notebook and move the pages within the notebook. You are also able to select a page to make a copy of, this works really well if you have created your own template pages or have a specific setup of notes that you use often or need in more than one notebook. This feature is not available on the Scribe and it is a feature that I miss.All in all, I am disappointed in the Scribe. With a price point very similar to the reMarkable, I expected more. The only advantage that the Scribe has, in my opinion, is the ability to also have eBooks on the same tablet as my notes. I can see the backlit screen being useful in some instances, but considering all, especially considering the price, I would rather use my reMarkable, and have a separate e-reader",7 people found this helpful

"Introducing Kindle Scribe (16 GB), the first Kindle for reading and writing, with a 10.2‚Äù 300 ppi Paperwhite display, includes Basic Pen",3.0,Not bad... could be great with improved software,"Reviewed in the United States üá∫üá∏ on December 31, 2022",Option: Basic Pen | Setup: 16 GB | Offer Type: Without Kindle Unlimited,True,"First and foremost, this device feels quite great, physically and intuitively. It feels satisfying to handle and use, and the writing experience very well might be the best I have experienced outside of actual physical writing. I can see the Scribe becoming a very important and useful tool in my day to day life as an avid note taker / reader.That being said--There are many areas that need immediate improvement; updates that I feel can very easily become implemented soon with the release of software developments.For example (and these are just what I have encountered during in my initial days of use) the button on the side of the premium pen can only be programmed to one of the few other brushes (highlighter, eraser, pen, etc...). I wanted to change this button to become an ""undo"" shortcut, but I was unable to. Also, the button is only useable for this constricting functionality while it is continuously pressed down, with no other adjustable alternatives possible. You cannot press the button once to swap to a different brush, you must press it down for the entirety of the time you want to use the secondary function.Also, I found that, in the settings, there are only TWO magnification layouts possible, Regular and Large. I felt regular was a tad too small, and large too cramped. There is nothing else whatsoever in terms of layout sizing modifications.You cannot write notes physically into the books you are reading. You have to attach physical notes that, when completed, are only noticeable through confusingly small icons hidden on the page.There are only a small handful of writing brushes. Think 1998 MS Paint era versatility.It does not seem like you can adjust multiple different page layout styles for a notebook; you can only have one template across an entire book.You can only EMAIL your PDF's / Note files-- no bluetooth or WiFi transferring WHATSOEVER.You can't split-screen to try and take notes while reading a Kindle book / any sort of similar functionality to try and read and write simultaneously.There are only a couple dozen notebook page layout templates to begin with. Non-customizable, too.The small menu interface to swap in between brushes / brush sizes while note taking is collapsable, but remains in the same place and cannot be moved or changed. It is completely impossible to see / write behind it.I'm not sure if this is a Kindle issue in general, but I can't make edits to my device's information / device name while not connected to WiFi.The list goes on. These issues feel rather superfluous to me-- almost like many of them should have already been included from the beginning.Therefore, like I mentioned, I feel that this device truly has GREAT potential. I hope Amazon will promptly implement quick updates to the software of the Scribe, as I feel it could absolutely eliminate other competitors.Until then, however, I have to give it ~ 3 stars or so, as it currently feels quite lacking in terms of practicality / sensibility.",3 people found this helpful

The first was I just wanted a larger format to read from. My Kindle Oasis is amazing but as I am aging it is just too small. By the time I increased the font size that was easy for me to read without my glasses, I only got a few sentences per page. I also am always looking for something to write down a note for something. If I get a phone call and need to take down information I can quickly open a page to write stuff down on. Where I think the product fails is in its features. My library does not show books like my other devices. Even if I purchase an item it doesn‚Äôt show up in my library on the first page like it should. As far as ease of reading it is fantastic. The battery life is so much better than my Oasis. I was lucky, I had an old Kindle to trade in, points from my Amazon card and a 75 dollar gift card from Amazon . After all was said and done I paid $89 for it. If I had paid more than that I would be aggravated too. For that price it should have internet connectivity also so working on PDF‚Äôs would be easier. They still have to work out a lot of bugs, but as far as a larger e-reader it is great. Same crystal clear paper like screen that I know and love.

After the Oasis and Paper White SE the Scribe changes the whole perspective in E-readers. Aside from the writing capability, the size is a major factor. For some , it can be clumsy and awkward and to others it can be enlightening. A case is an absolute necessity for a comfortable read because of the size. To try holding it to read can be quite a chore.Having had every kindle model (sans DX) I can truly say that it is not for everyone, as a reader. It may suit those who are seeking a writing instrument but, as a reader, it becomes an ""iffy"" choice. Buy it, try it and return it, if it does not suit you. For me, I will keep it.Following update: I have returned the Scribe mainly because it is, in reality, very difficult to use as a reader. The unit is too large to hold and a case is absolutely necessary. My problem comes from the fact that I am a night reader and to read with this device in bed becomes a definite challenge.

It is a very expensive re-purchase that I had to make.  So I want to suggest that the pen come in other colors besides the dark grey that is difficult to find if you drop it somewhere. A nice bright color would help.Now that I am aware that it may become detached accidentally from the magnetic hold, I will be more careful.Other than the pen incident, I am very happy with my kindle scribe. However, you must do research to decide if its right for your needs. For instance, it doesn't mark on books that you have in your kindle.

I am a kindle fangirl and already own three Paperwhites and a Kindle Voyage...not to mention multiple Kindle Fires.  I have always wanted a large tablet sized e-ink kindle so I don't have to turn pages as often.  I am retired and have a lot of time to read comfortably, while sitting in a recliner.  I have a soft tablet holder that I use to prop up the device on my knees.  I might use the pen one day, but I haven't tried it yet.  I review a lot of advanced reader copies that are sent to my kindle, so I thought I might use the pen feature to make notes while I'm reading.  Let me state clearly, I would not have bought this device for myself.  With all the e-ink kindles I own already, to spend over three hundred dollars just to get a bigger reading screen would not have justified that purchase.  So I put it on my Amazon Wishlist just for hahas, thinking no one would splurge for me- but the joke was on me because my son got it for me for Christmas!  I love the feature where you can make the bookcover of the book you're currently reading what appears on the screen when you first wake up the device.  So when I open my Kindle Scribe cover (that happens to be one of the automatic sleep/wake covers), my book cover appears and the words ""Waking up"" appear at the bottom of the screen.  It makes me feel like I'm really reading an actual book.  The screen is very responsive and the charge lasts forever.  I got this for Christmas 2022 and I haven't had to charge it yet!  Another thing, the device is heavy...to be expected with its size.  I have no problem with this because I use a tablet holder to support it while I'm sitting in a recliner.

I appreciated that it was an android tablet but I just wanted something simpler and am trying the scribe.Thoughts about ereading:It's simple to set up and navigate - its just a big kindle with a notebook feature.I'm surprised how light it is but that it still feels premium.The processor is fast so downloading and changing pages etc is super snappy.I am an Oasis fan and am shocked how much I enjoy reading on the Scribe even without buttons.  I think this is due to the fast performance - you never have to re-press the screen to confirm your selection.I tend to read with the wide bar on the left side while I change pages with the right.Writing is really impressive.  I was afraid there would be lag but the Premium stylus glides along and feels great in my hand and on the screen. The screen is a little slicker than a Boox but not enough to matter. I set the option button to erase and it works great.As others have said, there are not a ton of writing options.  There are a number of page templates and a few pen and thickness choices, plus the option to email to 5 addresses to export via pdf, or manage via the kindle app. Then again they're is very little (maybe nothing) for copy/paste and no character recognition.Still, I wasn't looking to write a book on this device.

I just wanted a bigger screen for reading, which this unit provides very successfully.  I have an Oasis, which I like, but even its 7"" screen still makes the Oasis feel more like a device than a book, at least to me.  I expect I will still use it when traveling, and use the Scribe at home.The weight of the unit is a bit higher than other Kindles, of course, but it does not feel too heavy to me.  In fact, occasionally resting the unit in my lap while reading feels natural (more book-like), with its size making it easier to do than with my Oasis.There seems to be some unhappiness expressed in reviews and comments about the lack of hardware page turn buttons, with some even saying this is a deal breaker for them.  This isn't a problem for me, as it's very easy to turn pages with a small swipe of a thumb on whichever hand you're holding the kindle with.  So if you're holding it with your hand, you can use your thumb to do a very short and quick swipe on the screen to go in either direction.  I actually prefer this method to using the Oasis's hardware buttons, as they are located too far above the corner of the reader, which is where I like to hold it.  And trying to reach up past the center of a ten-inch tablet's frame to advance pages would be even more uncomfortable for me.  My advice: if you have a Kindle now, try using this page turn technique to see if the Scribe will work for you, even if you prefer to hold the device on its side.  It feels pretty natural to me.The bottom line here is that if you're just looking for an e-ink reader with a screen that's luxuriously spacious, the Scribe does this very well.  It's fully comparable to whichever reader you're using now - if you can accept the button-less design.",One person found this helpful

I saw an order for a new one in my orders - with no predicted shipping date.2) I followed up with a different CSR and asked how long this will take - given that I could order a new one through the website and get it tomorrow.3) They initially said I would need to return mine, wait for a decision about whether repair was possible or replacement and then I'd get either a new one or a replacement.  I suggested that this was both incorrect and in conflict with what the initial CSR had said.  This CSR then changed the story and said that the replacements come from a different warehouse and that it would take 2-3 weeks for me to get my replacement.4) So I escalated and got a supervisor engaged - who agreed to make an exception, allow me to just buy a new one, and (when the return was received) refund to me the cost of the new purchase.  I'll update a final time when I get the refund.‚Äî-Final update.Refund received.",2 people found this helpful

As a minimalist working professional who likes to read, I have used it to replace my paper notebooks (which were getting hard to keep track of) and get a strong e-reading experience.It was a close tie between Kindle Scribe and Kobo Elipsa. Kobo Elipsa is more morally sound with its manufacturing done in Taiwan instead of China (and I will likely switch devices for those reasons when Kobo catches up technologically, if Taiwan is still an independent nation by then); but at the end of the day, the Scribe's hardware is more advanced and I believe most functionality can be enhanced with firmware updates. I also did not like the idea of having to re-acquire my library for Kobo due to Digital Rights Management.Overall, the Scribe has been great - the battery life certainly isn't two weeks if you're using it for anything that is actually practical, beyond idiotic and intellectually impotent musings like ""I find my inner child today"" or ""Take more  naps"" or ""Discovery leads to joy"". But the battery life is still strong, and this device is worth it. I just wish the marketing campaign didn't make me so queasy. One recommendation I would have for Amazon is this: create an option within Notebooks that allows me to change the template either in the whole notebook, OR, just for one page. That would be a game-changer.",3 people found this helpful

It's also nice to have my books and my notebook available on one device - I never did figure out how to download books on the reMarkable.  I even figured out how to send the documents to the Scribe using the Send to Kindle format; look, I'm 69 years old and not as tech-savvy as some of the younger folks out there.My only complaint is that I am not always able to take notes on the documents I send to the Scribe.  I use forms to help prepare for funerals and such (I'm an ordained pastor), and there are times I want to mark up the documents I've sent, and it seems to allow me to do so on a random basis.Altogether, I'd say this is well worth the investment.

The larger screen has made reading much more enjoyable. There's less page flipping. The backlit screen is good quality. This is my third kindle device, and I prefer the epaper in the kindle to reading on a tablet, phone or a computer. Out of the three kindles, this is the winner by far. I never saw a reason for the Oasis as the size was not noticeably larger than my Paperwhite or Kindle 3 (with a keyboard), which both have the same size smaller screen. This kindle has the large size of a full size notebook or tablet.I liked the ability to write notes, but there's no handwriting recognition. It's strange that one of the most valuable companies on the planet cannot get handwriting recognition into their device when so many software companies, even struggling software companies, were able to do it a decade ago. The interface is also on the weak side. The note storage and organization is unintuitive. The entire interface is somewhat unintuitive, and I've been using these devices for quite some time. They need to put more effort into usability. Another suggestion... It would be great if we could link notes in one book to another book. Just a thought, especially if there are bookmarks in the books. I have Christian Book software called ""Logos"" that links all of their titles together. It's not really relevant for most fiction, but it is for non-fiction and scholarly works.This rollout left something to be desired, too. The case has not yet arrived. That's a basic logistics issue, but it seems that they were not ready for the release date they chose. Perhaps is has to do with the unrest and zero covid policy in china. It's forgivable but I wouldn't mind a free month of kindle unlimited as compensation. (Let's see if they come through). Seriously, I would have prefered it if the case had arrived with the device.

I've been migrating to low tech or no tech for writing..it's just a better flow. Also, I've been doing more reading for ""learning"" , subsequently I need to be more intentional when I read in order to process, integrate and retain the information (i.e taking notes).  The Scribe checks all the boxes for a reading and writing device.The notebook feature is wonderful, it's become a receptacle for all the paths my mind meanders down. Some of these paths I may never revisit, but when/if I choose to revisit a thought/idea its neatly tucked away in the Scribe.  Thanks to the Scribe I'm journaling more consistently (and it feels so good).  I've used Day One for sometime now, but found having to type in the entries was limiting (technically I can PDF and upload my scribe entries to Day One).Since I received it early Dec the Scribe has become my go to digital device. It was not immediately so but over the past several weeks , it's gradually woven its way into all aspects of my day.Also, my handwriting can be undecipherable (even to me)  the erase feature is comes in super handy..I look forward to ""copy/paste"", the ability to move pages and notebooks around and a search feature.IMO the Scribe is one of those ""transformational"" digital  products akin to the iPhone.",2 people found this helpful

Let me start with the positives - the writing experience on this device is excellent. The surface is smooth and comfortable to write on, and the auto-adjusted screen light makes it easy to read and write at any time of the day.However, I do have some concerns with this device that I would like to highlight. Firstly, it does not allow the creation of subfolders, which can be quite inconvenient when organizing notes and notebooks. Secondly, the device only allows for one format of page per notebook, which means you cannot customize individual pages to your liking.Another drawback is that the Kindle Scribe does not sync with any cloud services yet. This means that you cannot access your notes and notebooks from other devices, which is a significant inconvenience for those who need to switch between devices often.Additionally, there are not enough selections of page templates to choose from, which can be limiting when trying to create various types of notes. Lastly, you cannot cut and paste text from one page to another or to a different notebook, which can be frustrating when trying to transfer information.I completely agree that the Amazon Kindle Scribe has the potential to be a great product if and when Amazon delivers updates to address some of its limitations. It is worth noting that the Kindle Scribe functions excellently as an e-book reader, but as a writing tablet for note-taking and organization, it is not yet on par with the competition.That being said, I remain optimistic that future updates will address some of the concerns I mentioned earlier, and make the Kindle Scribe a more versatile and convenient device for writing and note-taking. So, if you're looking for an e-book reader with the added benefit of writing capabilities, the Kindle Scribe is still a viable option, with the hope that it will continue to improve over time.",

The pen and screen work great, even if the notes software still needs improvement. The overall feel of the device, with an aluminum back and solid feel, is sturdy. This is promising as Amazon will undoubtedly improve the overall experience. I bought the Scribe knowing that the hardware was good quality and trusting that Amazon would build on that with software improvements. Scribe's future is bright.",

This was a birthday gift from my family. I love that the pen is magnetic, however, the placement of where the pen goes could have been better. I would rather have the option of sticking it to the top rather than the right side. As I don't always need to write, I find that I have to take it off in order to hold the kindle in my right hand, which could potentially cause the pen to get misplaced.I also have not yet found how to keep the screen from automatically rotating when even slightly tipped backward. It is irritating to not have a screen lock option.As with my last two paperwhites, it is so smooth a cover is needed, but affordable options are not as readily available so until mine finally arrives, I'll have to treat it with kid gloves. It would be nice to have a grippier back rather than so smooth.The power button and charging port could have been better placed. They truly are where the left hand rests and does become awkward when holding it and trying to avoid the button. Having landscape mode could alleviate some of this awkwardness. The button is also very sensitive. I have been transporting it in my purse. I don't want to put it pen side down and damage the pen, but putting it button side down causes it to constantly wake up. Leaving it at the bottom where they are on every other kindle would have been better.Overall, I am very happy with this. I do a lot of recreational reading, as well as a lot of biblical study reading. Having the capability to notate inside the study books keeps the needs for separate notebooks at bay.

So I am always having to press the button the side to wake it up before I write anything, that is not ""digital paper"". I would be happy to compromise power consumption for convenience.By default marketing information collection Privacy is off.And, at risk of showing myself to be technically incapable, I am trapped in the notebook section with no apparent way of getting back to other functions. No meaningful instructions. I can get to Settings using the normal Kindle swipe down from the top but I cannot get to Kindle.

Touching the screen near the top using finger instead of using the stylus is all it takes to bring up a navigation menu, problem solved.Now after a couple days I do find it disappointing that there is no ""always on"" option but there is a fast wake-up option which goes a long way to being a good 2nd best. However, what is great is the battery life. My Remarkable 2 needed charging every 20 hours, even with the wi-fi off (I had the always on enabled).

It feels very natural and control over handwriting is good. As many other reviews explain, the notebook software doesn't really compare to the competitors. No OCR. No pen styles besides a pen and highlighter. No way to search through text in a notebook. Limited template styles. Are these really limitations or is the Kindle Scribe just elegant simplicity? If your expectations are to use this the same as a standard notebook having various paper formats and unlimited pages, then it is just perfect.

You can tell this is a rushed product and the software needs much more development time. As an Amazon ereader, it works flawlessly as expected. The note taking on it is super basic, the ability to write on PDFs requires you to send the PDF through Amazon, you can‚Äôt just plug it into a computer and drag and drop it on the device (deal breaker for me), and the overall feel of the software just feels lacking.Features I wish Amazon would implement as this would totally change my opinion:1) Ability to mark on PDFs by just plugging into a PC and dropping the file on the scribe. I can drop the file on the scribe and view it but I can only mark on it by running it through Amazon‚Äôs servers.

There are times when the boxes are useful (especially when there is a lot of text I would like to write) but there are times when I would just like to circle things or write a quick note on a page.3) Add Bluetooth keyboard support.

I do a lot of typing and being able to do it on a device where the screen is easy on my eyes and I‚Äôm not able to be distracted would be a complete game changer for this device for me where it would probably become my daily driver.4) Add a few more extra features to the notebooks. I don‚Äôt have anything in particular to complain about but there is just something about the overall feel when using them that just seems super basic.

It has a large screen, the screen is clear and crisp making it excellent for reading.  The also rotates so that which ever hand you use to hold it, you can keep on reading seamlessly. The larger space on the bezel on the side makes it very easy to hold, although I would have loved to have page turning buttons.  I do recommend getting some sort of case for it because I feel the device and sleek but very slippery with out one.  A case would enable you to get a good grip on it without feeling like you'll drop it.  I love the sticky note option, I can make myself a quick note when I am reading a book with a lot of characters in it to keep up with and view them when I come across the name of the character as it comes up again when I may have forgotten who they were in the story.  I love the notebook option making it perfect for me to do my journaling in without using any real paper, but I  have no worries for privacy issues because I am the only one who has access to my scribe, so if you plan to use this as a shared device and privacy is important to you this may not work for you.

"Introducing Kindle Scribe (16 GB), the first Kindle for reading and writing, with a 10.2‚Äù 300 ppi Paperwhite display, includes Basic Pen",2.0,"Reads well, not useful for taking notes or writing","Reviewed in the United States on January 7, 2023",Option: Basic Pen | Setup: 16 GB | Offer Type: Without Kindle Unlimited,True,"I'll be fair with my pro's and cons.Pro:- The 300dpi screen. It's the only 10' ereader on the market with 300dpi, and it shows (most others are 227). The fonts look beautiful, nothing looks or feels pixelated- The speed. Page turns feel almost instant.- Nifty page turn animation.- Night mode. I don't know if this has been standard with Kindles but it really helps to have the colors inverted when you're reading at night- The 'feel' of writing. It feels smooth, no latency, and the surface + pen is the right 'feel' for this kind of device (paper-like)Cons:- PDF reading is still awful. Many PDFs have ridiculous margins... the 'meat' of the PDF is in the middle. If you render this on the screen, you end up with tiny text in the middle and tons of whitespace on the edges. Other ereaders will autocrop the margins for you so your screen is just zoomed in to the main content. With this Kindle, you can zoom in, but it zooms right back out if you try to turn the page. If you have a long PDF, it makes reading it impossible.- The 'writing' experience (other than the physical feel) is... well, it's not there. It's like the product team was told ""make this technically write"" and they shipped something that by the strictest legal definition is capable of 'writing' and called it a day. This is why, despite being a good e *reader*, I only gave it 2 stars, because it's not a good e-*writer*.A few specific notes on this:- You can't mark-up your books, as in write notes in them in the way any person thinking ""writing in a book"" might think. Instead, you can highlight part of the text, put an annotation in it, and that annotation happens to be a hand-drawn image instead of typed-out text. Not handwriting converted to text either, just a literal drawing that only shows up if you click on the word. And that's only for books from the Kindle store in Amazon's proprietary format. It won't work if you directly load a book from Project Gutenberg or the like. Even with the Amazon version, you can't, say, underline a word or circle it or make a little arrow that leads off to the margin or anything (unlike other e-writing products like Boox or Remarkable). So, you can't so much 'write in a book' as much as 'create a doodle that shows up when you click on a word on some of the ebooks in your collection'- You can't even mark up PDFs without sending them to Amazon first. So, if you have a contract you need to sign, you have to email it to Amazon, let them read and process it and turn it into their own proprietary format, have them upload it to your Kindle (this is the 'send to kindle' feature) and then you can write on your PDF. I'm not sure what the process of getting your PDF back to the original person is, but this is clearly an awful workflow if you have lot¬†of PDFs you need to annotate and/or care about privacy of those PDFs. Again, other e-writers just let you do this out of the box.- Say you did want to write a note on a blank virtual sheet of paper. It lets you do that. You get a screen and the option to write on it and erase. Cool. Now let's say you wanted to actually do something with that note, like find it again. Or send it to someone. Or screencast to present. Or embed something in it. Or link it. Or... you get the picture. If you have a giant pile of papers at home that you sporadically write something on to, and throw those papers away forever for no one to see, then this 'writing' is fine. But if you're a person who actually has a real-person workflow around writing (as many of us do nowadays) this is a toy proof-of-concept feature and nothing more.In short: get if you want an e-reader with the largest, crispest screen on the market, but if you are looking for a device to use pen input for writing, get literally any other device.",8 people found this helpful

Organizing notes is very limited and you can only have 1 level of note folders. It also isn't clear if the notes are backed up to the cloud. There are pretty much no tools for writing. You have a pen, eraser and highlighter and that is it. You can change the pen width. You cannot edit templates, you cannot create new templates and templates seem to mix up the spacing between lines, some are narrow, some are wide and you can't pick :(3/ Battery is amazing, I do keep it in airplane mode but after 4 solid days of usage, reading, writing totalling many many hours, battery is at 91%.4/ It needs a faster way to switch between notebook and reading. Some kind of Home button would work well. If you're reading a book and want to quickly make a note or read a note, it is a multi-step process to get from A to B.Overall it is a very capable device.

Nevertheless, I purchased the base model of Kindle Scribe.The large display is gorgeous and it doesn't strain my eyes as expected. I prefer reading ebooks on Kindle devices over real paper books for multiple reasons - the choice of font family and size, the front light, the ease of highlighting text, the ease of holding a lightweight device over a heavy paper book, and the ease of carrying my entire collection of books with me wherever I go. Also, Kindle ebooks are generally cheaper than their paper counterparts. For me, this 10.2 inch display Kindle was an investment definitely worth making!",

So it was almost returned.I purchased it instead of the Remarkable 2 because (a) the Kindle reading and (b) the MS Office integration that is coming out next year. Like everything that Amazon produces, it is 3/5 stars.BOTTOM LINE: If you are using this as a Kindle reader only, then save some money and buy an Oasis or a Paperwhite unless, of course, you just like the size or want the latest and greatest. If you want to use it as an editor, then you need to wait until they upgrade with MS Word for it to be any sort of useful ... or use only PDFs that can never be downloaded with the handwriting. If you just need something to journal in without lugging around a notebook, then this is good.PROS:* You can read your Kindle books, which is the primary reason I purchased this.* You can write on newly uploaded PDFs, which is awesome if you edit a lot of stuff.* The upload & storage service is free, probably to encourage more Kindle eBook purchases.* Unlike the Android version of the Kindle app, you can purchase eBooks directly.* Saves paper because you can journal.* I like the pen (I bought the upgraded one).* The size makes it nice for people who are used to writing in a notebook.* It is lightweight, so it doesn't make my hands hurt after holding it for some time.CONS:* The Send-to-Kindle is super buggy. They deactivated MOBI files, but you can't send anything except PDF, DOC, TXT, etc. You have to use their extremely slow & bad web upload service to send ePUB files, which errors out on almost 50% of the files (or email service, which is better).* The notebook feature is truly awful beyond journaling. You cannot insert pages (but you can delete pages), add bookmarks, use anything other than their templates (c'mon, Amazon, why didn't you create a calendar template?), or add images.* You also cannot use a notebook page as your screensaver, which would be a terrific feature for anyone using this as a to-do list maker.* You cannot turn off the auto-rotate, which is HIGHLY annoying.* You cannot download your handwritten stuff.* Handwriting does not convert text that I can see.* The handwriting action in the Kindle books is only meh.* You cannot add eBooks to a list on the Kindle book shopping page, so the aforementioned purchasing is useless.* All the older PDFs (to use the writing action) is not backwards compatible. So you need delete them & reupload. Kindle users will know how much of a pain it is to sort through stuff.* Your notes appear as an irritating item on your homepage.* The web launcher is buried & you can't add it to the homepage.",9 people found this helpful

Others have left fantastically detailed reviews; I‚Äôll skip out on a long review and refer you to my long video instead. :)The one bug I‚Äôve found in my (limited) use of it is that in notebooks, when I erase, a slight ‚Äúimpression‚Äù of the erased part remains. It disappears when I close the notebook and open it back up (or in *some* cases when I turn the page). You can see this in my video and in one of my photos.It feels fairly light at first, but I did get tired of holding it doing that video. So it‚Äôs definitely something I want to have propped up when I read. It‚Äôs approximately twice as heavy as a Paperwhite.One more note: while I like the premium pen, I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs worth an extra $30. It‚Äôs really easy to switch between pen and highlighter, so having a dedicated button for that just isn‚Äôt that important to me, especially since as others have mentioned, it‚Äôs easy to accidentally depress that button while writing. And having the eraser at the end of the pencil is fun, but it‚Äôs also really easy to tap the icon to change to an eraser, so it‚Äôs not really important to have a separate eraser.Overall really excited for this. I‚Äôm going to love the ability to write handwritten notes!P.S. A couple of other things I've noticed as I've used it more:I really do like that you can change the ""warmth"" to make it more off-white‚Äîand that feature is highly adjustable. It also has ‚Äúnight mode‚Äù with a black background, like my Paperwhite did.I got from 56% to 97% in less than an hour of charging. This thing charges fast!Edit: soon after getting my first Scribe, I found a ‚Äúdead spot‚Äù in one corner where I couldn‚Äôt write. Got a replacement device, same issue (and discovered it in another corner too). It ended up being an issue with my MoKo brand case, not with the Kindle! My Fintie case doesn‚Äôt have this issue. If you have any issues with dead spots, take off your case and see if the issues persist.",70 people found this helpful

I have a Samsung Note Ultra and other apps that allow for you to do planning and note taking, but you practically have to have your hand in the air while the stylus makes marks where you didn't put them.  Writing on the Kindle Scribe is just link writing on paper, only inkier and smoother.I have access to my notebooks just about anywhere.  Once I create a notebook, I open up the Kindle app on my phone in the grocery store or at the doctor's office, and there's my Kindle Scribe list.  I can't edit the list on my phone or tablet, but it sure is helpful.I've purchased a PDF planner from Etsy and I've downloaded some free crosswords and Sodoku puzzles as well.  Sure I can just download my own homemade planner and calendar, but I don't know how to make links and all that.I grab my Kindle Scribe first thing in the morning to write down everything I want to accomplish for the day while it's fresh in my mind, including the calls I have to make, the plants I have to water and things I need from the grocery store.What I do not use my Kindle Scribe for is reading.  I'm still a big fan of my Kindle Oasis, I like the small size and it's better for holding while drinking tea, wrapped in a blanket.It would be great if they made a note-pad sized Kindle Scribe, I would take it with me everywhere. Two sizes:  a Kindle Oasis sized notepad, and one that can fit in a man's shirt-pocket.  Who needs paper anymore!?",2 people found this helpful

Writing on the Scribe was nice, it felt natural just like pen and paper. I will say I was a little disappointed at the lack of features on the writing, notebook side. As this is their first kindle with this functionality I expected more. There are several templates to choose from when creating a notebook such as lined, grid, music paper etc. which was nice. Cut, copy & paste from notes is not currently an option so if you write in the wrong notebook or decide to move something you are stuck rewriting it. Although you can send pdf and other documents to your kindle scribe they just go into your library and do not allow you to put them in with your notebooks. This makes is kind of annoying as I am constantly switching between notebooks and my library to find things. Being able to move them to the notebook side would allow for easier use of forms, templates, other notes and to be able to better sort content. I was also surprised the device was not waterproof or at least water resistant as that has been a big selling point for me on other kindles. I definitely will have to be extra careful as it may not survive a trip to the beach or those bathtub reads. Overall it is a good product, the e-ink display is easy on the eyes and reading is pretty seemless. The writing ability is nice for taking notes in books, highlighting and creating notebooks.

Here are my quick thoughts on why:1) You can read books with graphs/pictures/diagrams much more easily with the Scribe. Due to the bigger screen and higher resolution, the pictures are easier to see. In my previous experiences, I had to switch from the Kindle White to the iPad to make sense of graphs and diagrams.2) Because this is a device that doesn't do a million different things, I can focus better. And now that the Scribe has writing capabilities, I have taken up writing daily journals into the Kindle as I can have my ""focus"" time.3) I got the denim case, and although it does not have the strongest magnet/grip, it's adequate for my usage as I carry this in a bag, not just by the case. Of course, your usage may vary.4) I got the premium pen, and although I don't use the button that much, I have used the eraser quite a lot.5) I find the sticky note method to be adequate for the moment. Some are saying that it would be good to write directly on the book, but to be fair, there isn't much empty space is on the margin of the book.6) It would be good if Amazon can come up with text recognition (OCR) in the future. But I have found other OCR features in other notebook apps to be not too accurate, so I don't rely on those too much.

I still decided to buy it, because of the incredible hardware specs this device has. That being said, I am confused about the hardware....I have been eying a few different 10.X‚Äù e-ink devices the last couple of years (Boox/reMarkable devices, etc) but the 227 PPI screens were not good enough to render small text on some of the PDF's I read on my iPad. So when this device came out, I was excited. Not only could I have my whole Kindle library on it, but according to the specs, it would have great resolution... except it doesn't... at least when talking about PDF's.I have uploaded 3 images (hopefully you can see what I am talking about in the pictures) to show you that PDF's are NOT rendered at 300 PPI.The first PDF I tried was using the Send to Kindle feature since you are required to do that in order to markup PDF's. When I opened the table of contents on the PDF, the left hand text (red box in attached image) is illegible. Which surprised me quite a bit given this device is supposed to have a 300 PPI screen.What's interesting is that my iPad Pro 11"" has a 257 PPI screen. I thought maybe it was just the fact that screen was bigger on the iPad, but when I scaled down the PDF to the same size (in the iPad Kindle app) as the Scribe screen (you can see the border around the PDF as compared to the full screen size in the attached image) the text on the left is legible. This doesn't make sense to me considering the Scribe is supposed to have a higher PPI screen than the iPad.At this point, I thought maybe there was some compression when it went through Send to Kindle, so I then USB loaded the PDF, even though you cannot annotate, just to compare. There was no change (once again, shown in red box in attached image). So clearly it was not the compression.This is a huge issue for me. I don't think many people really need 300 PPI for ebooks since you can scale the text easily. PDF's are where this thing would really shine if it actually would utilize 300 PPI, but clearly it doesn't and actually looks like a 227 PPI screen. For this reason, it's going back until this gets resolved. While the hardware is theoretically great, it's not working properly. This combined with the many software limitations puts it behind its competitors by quite a margin.",8 people found this helpful

I thought I might use it primarily on the subway. I am lucky enough to get a seat during my commute. But despite sitting down, and holding the scribe with 2 hands, I just found it too heavy too hold. Part of this is because the aluminum body makes the e-reader heavy and slightly difficult to grip. I tried reading on the scribe once or twice on the commute and just decided to leave it at home.Thought the scribe would get more usage in a leisurely, relaxed setting. But this was not the case. I think the surface area is just simply too big compared to the traditional size of a book which might measure anywhere between 7 to 8 inches diagonally. I felt eye fatigue as I was shifting my eyes from left to right, and then from top to bottom. The scribe was also uncomfortable to hold and to reposition constantly. You can't get a good grip on the e-reader unless your hands are large to begin with.So I decided to return the scribe for the above reasons. I think if Amazon were to make an 8-inch e-reader with the same plastic, grippy build as the paperwhite, that would be the ideal reader for me.",4 people found this helpful

Very well built and super high quality. When it comes to kindle functionality, it's very smooth, and there is no lag in loading the pages, which is what we expect from Kindle. The writing experience gives you the closest feeling as you write on paper, which is really satisfying. However, the software itself is crazily limited. Basically, whoever built that was in an extreme rush to send it to the market and, probably after that, make it more mature. It doesn't have any functionality, which is usually needed by a note-taker. There are no bullet points, no tags, no layers to create, no way to select some texts and change their location in the paper, no way to put a page number, and no integration with cloud services like Google cloud or Dropbox. No handwriting-to-text conversion. Common Amazon, you are a huge capable company. Many other brands have those functionalities, and then you, Amazon, don't. Your kindle is like Mercedes sending a vehicle with just seats, steering wheels, and lights and then saying, we will give you the rest later!!! You need to do better than this. My conclusion is that this can be a fantastic device IF they come up with some feature updates and cover the lack of functionalities, and then I guess the other brands will have a hard time compete",One person found this helpful

Got it three days after launch just in time for a three day conference.  I charged it to 100% as soon as I got it.  It has been roughly 40 days of active use, marked by patches of not needing it for a couple days here and there, and the battery is only at 44%.  I have not plugged it since the day I opened the box.  Battery life is absolutely phenomenal.The responsiveness to writing is near-instantaneous and I cannot notice any kind of delay.  Using the finest pen tool, it looks just like my own handwriting.  Even when writing small letters, it comes out clean and clear.  Though the notetaking capability is limited in features right now, the coming updates are very promising and should greatly increase the quality of life of an otherwise already-pretty great tool.  I strongly recommend getting the premium pen for ease of erasing.The Scribe is a great piece of hardware that's lacking on software features in the notebook functionality, but the great news is that updates are coming.  If you just need to write stuff for now and you use Kindle Paperwhite, it's a great choice.PS: It does come with four pen-nibs in the box so you don't have to worry about buying an extra set when buying the tablet.PS2: For people considering the Remarkable 2 as an alternative, there's a lot of articles suggesting that 2023 is potentially the year that they will announce the Remarkable 3.

Sending it back,"Reviewed in the United States on December 2, 2022",Option: Premium Pen | Setup: 64 GB | Offer Type: Without Kindle Unlimited,True,"I wanted to like the device as I am a Kindle fanatic and have several generations of Kindles starting around 2009 and thought it would be great for writing since I am constantly jotting down notes and drawing diagrams. I own a year-old 12.9 iPad pro with an Apple pencil, and while it's great for note-taking, I wanted a dedicated device with an e-ink screen to improve the experience.The Scribe's hardware is good but could be better. It has a great screen size, but the power button and charging port locations are very peculiar. When carrying this in my hand, it keeps turning it on since the power button is smack down where your hand rests (and not comfortable).Also, this device is on the heavier side and very slick. I wouldn't have minded if it was not made of aluminum and had a grippier surface, so adding a cover will be a must unless you want to damage it very quickly when dropping it on the floor.The software is where the Scribe falls apart.It's very simple, and while intuitive, it leaves a lot to be desired. First off, when writing, I keep touching the top part of the screen with my hand, which brings down the connectivity and screen brightness menu, making it very difficult to write without activating this over and over. It's maddening that they would keep this on this device (identical to other Kindles, which are acceptable for read-only devices).Another area that needs work is the notebooks. Very limited, so you are stuck with just a few different options, with lines either too spaced apart or not spaced enough. The Pen menu is also very limited, way less than iOS, with very few options for pen size or stroke (and seems like there are only two levels of pressure-sensitive adjustment).No setting to select and move text or objects is not even an option, and the auto-shape feature that other devices have is missing as well (drawing a circle or square will convert them to perfect circles or squares if you keep the pen on the page).Was hoping to be able to write on PDFs, but nope, that is not an option either. This has been available on iOS for a few years but not on Scribe. Also, no landscape support is a head-scratcher, as this would be perfect for a device this large.So, in short, if you want this for reading and light note taking (very light note-taking), it may be fine for you, but not at this price point for the few features it offers. I really wanted to love this, but it left me sorely disappointed. Hopefully, version 2.0 will improve this design and make it worthwhile. For now, I'll stick with my iPad Pro.",65 people found this helpful

On that front, this device delivers in spades. It is a joy to use for reading. In the hand it feels like a premium, elegant piece of hardware. I was initially bummed about the lack of physical, clicky page-turn buttons, but honestly the snappy tap-to-turn scheme works quite well. My only significant hardware whine? It's slippery as an eel. Amazon refuses to lightly texturize/stipple the borders on these devices and I'm not sure why. Also, for a device that costs this much, I wish it was waterproof. It's not a huge issue for me, but perplexing all the same. The power button placement is unfortunate and makes it too easy to accidentally shut it off. The magnets attaching the 'pen' to the device are wholly inadequate.The notetaking: technically it's really neat to write using e-ink and it's more responsive than I was expecting. The software, however, is a confusing disaster. I have no interest or need to mark up books or take copious notes, but if that's YOUR thing, expect frustration. Click on this/open that blah, blah, blah. It sucks.I've not taken delivery of the 'official' Amazon cover yet. Totally unfair of me to comment on it, but everything I'm reading about it makes me regret I ordered one. Sounds awful. We shall see.If you want a lovely, big screen e-reader with an ecosystem of millions of books, look no further. This is the one. Minor gripes aside, it's kickass.

Getting PDFs on the device to annotate requires sending them through Amazon's system, which means any confidential documents need to be sideloaded via USBC, making them read only.  Documents sent through the Amazon system generally appear washed out and are more difficult to read than Kindle content.Annotating PDFs is like working with an image rather than a text PDF- highlighting doesn't capture text like iAnnotate and other PDF readers on the ipad.  Basic PDF editing functions are absent, and there is no effective way to limit searches to a folder or even just to documents, so search results include every book and document in the kindle library.As noted by others, the file structure is insufficient for using the device at work.  It needs at minimum the ability to create subfolders, and there should be a way to select multiple documents to put in folders on the device itself rather than through the website.  The ability to group documents and notebooks together in a collection or folder would be helpful as well.As a notebook, the Kindle Scribe is very basic.  No cut and paste from one page to the next, no way to add pages, no handwriting-to-text features, no navigation features other than flipping one page at a time.  In that sense, it is as described, a digital version of a paper pad; it seems like a waste of potential.  The feel is like using a fiber-point or felt tip pen on paper.Reading Kindle content is great on the big clear screen.  If you're looking for a big-screen reader, the Kindle Scribe is the device for you.

I carefully packaged everything in it's original package, processed the return, printed out the label and went to my local UPS store. They asked if I had the box it came in and forced me to buy a padded envelope. I explained that I followed all of the instruction on the return, put everything back in its original package and included the return label.

This apparently is a known bug? I'm not sure if it's over multiple Kindle generations or just this one but for a 3 month old device that sort of thing shouldn't be happening. The other missing star is because I can't write directly on the book I am reading. Library book or not, I feel like we should be able to write marginalia directly on the book and then a screenshot or something be taken of the page so we can see our marginalia - it would be the same as if we had highlighted the whole page and added a note, so I feel like it's doable. It's also the last thing besides the actual smell of books that is missing from my reading experience on a device instead of a physical book. Another small issue I have is that where I touch the pen on book pages to underline/highlight words isn't always where the highlight starts, but when I am writing in the Notebook section it is super exact. So that might have to do with book formatting, not sure. Otherwise, I love the Scribe.

I bought this because I want the note ability and it's much bigger.It's a disappointment.  I knew it didn't have page turning buttons, prevaricated a lot, finally decided everything else made it worthwhile.  Now that I have it and have found several other flaws, the only reason I keep it is in the hope that future software upgrades will fix these problems.The font size control ONLY applies to the text itself; don't know about images, but it DOES NOT apply to definition popups, setting screens, or anything else.  This is really frustrating, as one of the things I like about the phone app is reading definitions or changing settings without putting on my reading glasses.The Library tab does not have the app's choice of ALL or DOWNLOADED.  You get all your ebooks, including stuff you read ages ago and aren't likely to read again.There is no way to get a blank screen when logged out.  I understand about eInk and not using the battery to display the image, but I'd rather have it completely blank when I'm not using it.There's a lot of functionality with the phone app which doesn't exist on this kindle, too much to list in detail.  I suppose it's probably missing from my old Oasis too, but I don't use it much any more.This is all a big disappointment.  I probably would not have bought it if I had known about all these flaws, but I do like the big screen and the stylus, and have decided to take the chance that software upgrades will fix at least some of these flaws.ETA that the software difference from the Android phone app is just too frustrating.  Every time I try to use it, for the bigger screen size and long battery life, I fumble like a newbie.  There is just too much missing functionality.If I were to do this over, I'd buy an Android tablet.  I may still use this when I need the stylus, but not for anything else.  I'll recharge the battery once every few months to keep it fresh enough, but that's it.",

I‚Äôve been a happy Kindle user since shortly after the first one came out with several updates since. Recently I became interested in digital notebooks and started researching. I decided on the 16 GB Kindle Scribe with Premium Pen and fabric cover.For my needs this notebook checks all the boxes. Occasionally I have to remind myself that the purpose of this device is not to replace an iPad but to replace a paper notebook and physical pen. And that it does with remarkable excellence.I have been keeping bullet journals for years, and now have volumes of them stacked on the shelf. So my first project was to see if I could successfully keep a bullet journal on the Kindle Scribe. The answer is a resounding, joyful, ‚Äúyou betcha.‚ÄùI never have to think about where my notebook is because it‚Äôs always with me. I never have to look for a pen or pencil because it‚Äôs always with me. I never have to find a flat writing surface because that‚Äôs what the Kindle Scribe is.

Someone is giving me a name and phone number. I‚Äôm scribbling it anywhere in the Scribe because the erase feature (so much fun to use) will allow me to restore that page to its original content in a heartbeat. The design is elegant and user-friendly. Importing and exporting is easy and so is information retrieval.And when I‚Äôm finished working, I just tap a button and go to my Kindle library and read to my hearts content with no eye strain and no annoying pop-ups.If I had one wish it would be that the next edition of the Scribe features copy and paste.

I'd always been impressed with the reading experience on my Kindle Paperwhite (which I traded in for a 20% discount on the Scribe). E-ink screens are so easy on the eyes and wonderfully battery-efficient. Plus, there's just something really cool (almost steampunk-ish) about the tech: a very thin, lightweight screen that looks identical to an old-school, printed page.I had read about other e-ink tablets like Boox and Remarkable, but never seriously considered buying one because of the high price. The cost of the Kindle Scribe seemed like a relative bargain, so I pre-ordered one in late November.As I waited for my Scribe to arrive, I read some of the reviews that began to pop up everywhere after release day. Invariably, those reviews praised the device's impressive hardware, but criticized its disappointing software when it came to note-taking, suggesting that future firmware updates should greatly improve its capabilities. Even so, I continued to hope for the best, because all I really wanted--or so I thought--was the digital equivalent of an analog sketchbook.Upon delivery, I quickly realized that the reviews I'd read were pretty spot-on. Reading Kindle books on the Scribe is--as expected--one of the best e-reading experiences you can get. The stylus feels very responsive with no discernible lag. Unfortunately, the pen settings are shockingly limited: 5 stroke thicknesses in only solid black and 5 highlighter thicknesses in only one shade of grey.I typically start a sketch by lightly penciling in some basic shapes/guidelines, then going in with darker strokes to refine and add detail. Because the Scribe's notebook software is limited to solid black strokes, it's impossible to work this way. I thought I could maybe use the grey highlighter to rough-in my initial strokes, but the thinnest highlighter stroke is too thick for that purpose.It's baffling to me that Amazon chose to omit pressure-sensitivity (an industry-leading feature that the included Wacom stylus technology is known for), as well as the decision to limit strokes to 5 preset thicknesses instead of featuring a slider that would provide much more variability. The ability to draw or write on separate layers would have been immensely useful as well. Just these three features would have improved the product SO much!I can only conclude that the Kindle Scribe was rushed out the door to meet a deadline. Certainly, these are features that could easily be added through future firmware updates, but there's no guarantee that will ever happen, and I doubt I'll be keeping my Scribe past its money-back return date to find out.",One person found this helpful

I would trust dropping a plastic bodied e-reader much more than this one and the plastic could allow for wireless charging too.

I'm sure software updates will fix this over time.-The note taking ability is pretty lackluster. It's essentially just a notepad and doesn't convert your written notes into text. Handwriting to text needs to get added if it wants to survive against Remarkable.-Sending documents happens over some funky custom email address that you can send to yourself. This isn't 2005. We need a specialized syncing app to view notes on your PC or phone.Conclusion:For casual users, you can probably wait for a sale and for some software updates to come out. For the hardcore users, well, you probably already have one.",5 people found this helpful

And I'm a reMarkable 2 user, so I was very excited at the prospect of the Scribe.I had some expectations based on some other formats -- I was expecting that I might be able to write on the book the way I can write on a PDF if I'm using another sort of tablet+stylus, but it clearly can't work that way since the text flow is dynamic, not static as it is in a PDF, so any scribbles and drawings I might make won't work in the flow of the text.I also had some expectations based on my experience with the reMarkable 2 tablet -- I would love to see the Scribe catch up with those and be able to offer handwriting to text conversion of notes, rather than just rending notes and handwriting as an image.  That I think can come as an advancement in the software, so I'm hopeful for that.I was hoping for something that would give me the functionality of the reMarkable 2 but that would have access to all of my books on kindle. It's close, and I hope it'll get there.  At the same time, it has some clear advantages. For example the Scribe has a backlight which makes this much better for reading in lower light situations, something the Remarkable can't match.In the end I'm pretty satisfied and the scribe will become part of my everyday carry just as soon as the cover arrives.",39 people found this helpful

The stylus and notepad feature are the only real new addition to the software. The touch sensitivity and accuracy with the pen is very good. There is also a rudimentary browser, but I find many websites don't play nice with it. It tries to open the desktop website, and not the mobile version making them unreadable. If there's gonna be a browser with this then it really needs some sort of antivirus. I don't care if it's a mac, apple tablet, or a kindle. If it connects to the internet, it needs antivirus of some sort. I'll be keeping mine in airplane mode from now on and only updating it through a corded connection to my PC. The page turning feature is kind if irritating. I wish I could run my finger across the page, so I don't lose my place without skipping to the next page constantly. Having physical buttons for pagr turning and the ability to turn off the touch sensitivity would be nice. For now, I just use the back of the stylus as a pointer. I'm glad I didn't get the one with the ""eraser"" on the back for this reason. Constantly using the stylus makes my hand tired because I can't rest it on the screen. It's a little annoying. Other than that, It's okay. Nothing really can beat a physical book.",

This device is not ready for the writeable tablet market. Amazon did not put adequate work into the software of the Scribe itself or the infrastructure that supports it. Many features that other devices have, such as the ability to download documents from Google Drive and Dropbox, to convert handwriting to text or to copy/paste/move written strokes are sadly missing from this otherwise great device. For the cost of the device and the caliber of developer talent that Amazon seems to recruit I would have expected a full slate of features that should easily rival a smaller company such as reMarkable. Other small things such as a wide array of page templates, multiple pen types and pressure sensitivity are also missing from this device. The Scribe comes across as a very high quality e-reader at a larger size (which many people have been wanting since the end of the Kindle DX), but the pen features sadly seem like an under developed afterthought.At this time I would not feel comfortable switching from my reMarkable 2 to the Kindle Scribe for my daily carry device because it is lacking too many features. It seems as though there is not even a way to view notes from the Scribe except on the device itself, which does not work for my workflow. I'm considering returning the Scribe as a result of its shortcomings, yet the large screen e-reader still seems to have a place in my fleet of devices, it is just not the ubiquitous drop-in replacement for the reMarkable 2 that I was hoping for. The eraser on the premium pen makes an unpleasant sound with the amount of pressure that must me applied to erase, which is less than ideal.Features that are desperately needed include: a mechanism to read notes across multiple platforms (Android, Windows, Mac, Linux) or Evernote synchronization, more options for pens/strokes, more sensitivity levels for the pen input (especially the premium pen), more sensitive erasing, a wider assortment of page templates and more options for transferring documents to and from the device.Overall, Amazon made an amazing large screen Kindle, but a pathetic attempt to compete with reMarkable, Boox, etc that Amazon's engineers should be absolutely ashamed of. If the team that released this product worked for me, I would probably fire whoever was responsible for establishing the design requirements of the software and ecosystem.",7 people found this helpful

The biggest thing that I was hung up on was not having the handwriting to text ability that my Samung Galaxy phone has. However I was able to rationalize not having that functionality since I prefer writing pen to paper for focusing as well as initial story development. If there are updates, I wouldn't mind a text integration!I'm also left-handed so I was worried about my palm making marks or messing up, but it hasn't happened as the scribe only focuses on the pen. It's nice to not have ink residue on my hand when I'm finished writing!The nicest thing about the Scribe is that it helps me stay focused during virtual meetings by note-taking rather than scrolling on my phone and I'm able to replace my bulky planner with something lightweight which saves space during my in-office days.I haven't used my Scribe as much for reading, I still have my paperwhite for that function but having a larger screen doesn't really detract from reading.

Using it primarily as a reader; however, I bought it mainly for the writing capability.

I have a Paperwhite with a stand and prefer that to just holding the device.  I worry about damaging the large screen, so I am only using it at home until the case becomes available.  I have cases on all my Kindle devices, and I find they feel too thin without them.I like the large screen with all the different lighting options.  However, if you are a fast reader, it causes eye strain because the reading column is too broad even at the widest margin settings.  The margins are adjustable, but not enough to make speed reading efficient. The Scribe requires a zigzag eye pattern, which is tiring. I  find my Paperwhite much easier to read because I can scan straight down the page.This is an easy software fix but one that needs to be done.

I like to throw my kindle in my purse or my bag so I can read while I‚Äôm waiting for appointments or on my lunch break. The scribe is too big for that or at least in my opinion.My heartache comes from the notebook itself. My remarkable allows me to create multiple folders and notebooks, so far I haven‚Äôt found that feature on Kindle. It writes ok, but I wish there were more options for the type of pen I wanted to use. Remarkable has a highlighter, calligraphy, pencil, thin, medium and thick options. Kindle scribe is very limited.I was hoping that Kindle would give us the option to make notes right on the page but it doesn‚Äôt, you have to create a sticky note and then it saves the notes to a separate book in your library. Which is fine I guess but if I download a workbook, I would like to have the option to write on those pages instead of having to continue to make notes on a separate page.To sum it up, I won‚Äôt return this because I do like the bigger screen for reading but I‚Äôm also having a bit of buyers remorse.

I have owned kindles in the past heck even traded in a paper white that had not seen use in years for that matter. With the Kindle app available on so many platforms the days of the dedicated reader are over for me.This is the crux of the situation Amazon had a chance to hit it out of the ball park with this one but instead only got to first base with a bunt.This is a very capable E-INK Reader with basic rudimentary note taking ability, cut copy and paste do not exist. OCR does not exist, the ability to recognize hand writing and convert to text does not exist.  The ability to create folders within folders does not exist. The erase feature is terrible, it makes you go over and over to get everything, which is a paper experience I can do without.All in all a very limited and limiting device when it comes to the note taking application.Perhaps this will improve? Not bad for 1st Gen device but not good enough. I wound up buying a BOOX Tab ultra E-Paper Tablet PC which is essentially an android 11 based operating system with a dedicated Graphics Processing Unit  for the E-Ink and is far more capable than anything I have seen in the E-Ink offerings from other companies.The kindle has a good refresh rate, there is no lag or latency when using the pen, everything is crisp and sharp. The single flaw here is they approached the ability to write on the screen and take notes from the perspective of it being an reader first and the rest just feels like a bolted on after thought.I fully intend to revisit the Kindle Scribe later perhaps by the 3rd or Fourth generation they will improve the system.Two recommendations for Amazon.#1. Use a dedicated GPU and get rid of the ghosting the browser on this thing is a weak sad joke.#2. Be first to market with colored E-Ink that really works not the 100 DPI pastel looking crap on the market today. It is way past time we had not only capable E-Ink but color as well.

I am also a Kindle user and have been for many years.  I bought the Kindle Scribe in the hope that I don't have to carry my Remarkable 2, MacBook, and my Kindle with me -- it does not solve that because the Kindle Scribe software is very deficient in far too many areas when compared to the Remarkable 2.* The Kindle Scribe does not have a selection tool.  That's right! --  You can't copy and paste or change the size of items that you have selected.* If you share a document via email, the Kindle Scribe puts the file name in large type at the beginning of the first page of the PDF.  That is a real bummer for obvious reasons.* In general, sharing of PDF's between my MacBook and the Kindle Scribe is clunky and not very useful.  It pales in comparison to the Remarkable 2.* There are only three marker types on the Kindle -- pen, highlighter, and eraser.  Not a deal breaker, but not  very useful if you are doing any type of drawing.  Combined with the lack of copy/cut and paste and object sizing, the Kindle Scribe is not even close to the Remarkable 2.* As a Kindle Reader, the Kindle Scribe is the best reader yet.* I like the backlight on the Kindle Scribe.  With my Remarkable 2, I carry a clip-on LED book light to use it in dimly lit places.In summary.  The Kindle Scribe is definitely an early first generation product and will hopefully get a lot of software updates to try and get close to the capabilities of the Remarkable 2.  If you are an existing Remarkable 2 user (like me) the Kindle Scribe, at its current software level, is a very disappointing product and is not anywhere close to the Remarkable 2.  If you just want to take basic notes then the Kindle Scribe is probably fine.  If you are trying to use it for Remarkable 2 type of tasks, then save your money and stick with the Remarkable 2 until the Kindle Scribe gets a lot of software updates.",4 people found this helpful

The writing experience is great but that's it. Notebooks are clunky. Getting a PDF in is absurd.NOTETAKING:Pen writes wonderfully. But you only get a couple of options.You can select from a number of backgrounds, lined, dot grid, graph paper, music, etc. However, the patterns are so dark and un-subtle that you can't reasonably turn them on and use them. Like having notebook paper that someone drew the lines on with a sharpie.You can't select things and move them around a page. You can't zoom in or out or pan. It's like having a great big static notecard. You can't see thumbnails of pages. You can't reorder pages. You can't move pages between notebooks. You can make a page or delete a page. That's it. Sharing is simply emailing a whole notebook as a PDF. No integration with anything.  No pen to text conversion.One star for the notebook features. I have a REmarkable that I never use because the software is lousy. It's 10x worse on the Kindle Scribe. Not even Beta.E-READING:It's a really good large-format ereader. If the price is worth it for that to your needs, then it's a 4.5 star.The pen adds NOTHING to the reading experience. You can only make notes that are virtual stickies. You can't underline, circle or anything like that or doodle/write notes in the margins like you can in a real book. That, to me is what digital books have always needed so I hoped it would happen with the Scribe. Nope.HARDWARE:Very nice, but that's exactly wrong. I like E-readers because they're plastic and I never worry about them. I don't put covers on them. I drop them on the desk or drop them in a bag. No worries. The Kindle Scribe is very nice so you'll have to put it in a case and treat it like an ipad. Exactly wrong for an E-reader.CONCLUSION:Once again, if having a big E-reader is worth the price, you may love the Kindle Scribe.

Thus, the release of the new Scribe was a thrill, and I ordered immediately when it was announced. It arrived today and while any immediate review has serious limits, here is my take so far.1) Book reading is great. As someone in their late 60‚Äôs, reading legibility is my number one issue and here, the Scribe is awesome. I can have the type sizes I need in a slim, elegant body that works well both indoors and out. However, this is only half of the story for me.2) PDF handling is a MAJOR disappointment. Here is where the Scribe is a letdown. As an academic researcher, I read many .pdf files for a living, usually using a iPad Pro. This works fine indoors, but outdoors in bright light is a problem. This is where I thought the Scribe would replace the iPad. Unfortunately, that‚Äôs just not the case. While lack of synching with Dropbox was a known issue, getting documents to the Kindle via ‚Äúsend to Kindle‚Äù works ok, so no issues there. The problem is (a) low resolution and (b) poor ability to zoom and pan.I tried the Scribe with multiple .pdf files, both of recent (2022) origin and older ones. Neither works well on the Scribe. Figures (especially maps and photos) do not show up well and getting the pages to the correct size for easy reading is just about impossible. The iPad simply does a much better job here. In addition, once you have zoomed in on a page on the Kindle, you can‚Äôt move to the next page without going back to the original page size, which is a real pain.In summary, I‚Äôd warn anyone who wants to use the Scribe for academic or professional reading of documents to be aware of these issues. Your milage may vary and your documents might be ok for someone with better eyesight, but the Scribe does not really compare with the iPad when it comes to handling .pdf files, at least not for me.I am undecided about whether to keep the Scribe or not. I still prefer it for reading books and now can easily read them outdoors, but am unsure whether that is a broad enough niche to make the $350 investment worthwhile.",4 people found this helpful

I like to write in my books and haven't loved the Kindle keyboard for this purpose. The new sticky notes are ok, particularly given that ebook margins don't provide the same kind of space as a paper book. (But I could imagine a technology that would allow you to create translucent writing over the electronic type face. ) And it  isn't particularly user friendly going back to review those sticky note markers. The biggest crime is that you cannot easily highlight in a book with the pen and need to use the prior somewhat clunky interface to highlight your selected quotation.The feel and responsiveness of the pen on the screen are excellent. And I enjoyed writing on it more than my iPad.  But the notes software is very basic and I have yet to import my handwritten notes into another notes app or printed them.I‚Äôm an attorney and marking up pdfs of case law and documents was a good experience.  I have yet to print the output and of course an ipad will enable you to do the same in color and with more features. I‚Äôm also skeptical if the Scribe is capable of managing a large or complicated library of pdf documents as the file management is rudimentary.For the price, I would hope there would be some robust software updates and perhaps the current software was rushed to make it marketable for the holiday season.  The prices for the premium pen and maxed out memory also are cash grabs, but useful to have.I‚Äôm a bit nervous about keeping it because when a waterproof model is eventually released as I am sure it will be I will be frustrated.  So too if they increase the processing power to support handwriting recognition.  I‚Äôd be surprised if the current hardware would support that, but that‚Äôs a pure guess.  It feels very much like a first gen product from the software perspective and I will likely keep it if I gain more confidence that there will be software updates not too far into the future.",

Connecting to Wi-Fi outside is glitchy. See the photo I took when I was trying to connect to WiFi at Charles-de-Gaulle airport, Paris, for their free option. The paid option had the same issues. Firstly, it was very hard to see the interface and text on Kindle to connect because the colors they used were not displayed on Kindle, and I did not see it when I was typing on it. When I connected, it opened multiple sessions. It connected to the same WiFi name on multiple connections and never work to download books or browse. See the photo of downloading error I got. I assume it is an error‚Ä¶ it is a picture or radio and clouds(?). I had the same issue at Mumbai Airport. The workaround for this is to download all books before you travel. It works fine on my home WiFi.2. It needs a solid hardcover. It was in my backpack, and it slightly bent in the middle. Still works fine.3. Once you upload your own pdf, it still needs WiFi to open it for the first time. They you do not need WiFi. I had pdfs loaded but not opened and with WiFi not connecting while traveling, no pdf would open.These issues have workaround as I mentioned to download purchased books or upload your pdf files and open at least once.4. I wish there is better way to search or filter books in a library.

My perspective is as a small business owner. I was sick of trying to keep track of all the random legal pads or notebooks that I used to write down notes during meetings. I was truly looking for an eNotebook type of solution when I saw that the scribe would soon be released. Some of the other eNotebook reviews, although high on the realistic writing feel, seemed cumbersome in ease of saving or converting files and had very limited space to save files. I also wanted something simplistic - the idea of an iPad Pro was a device that could accomplish the same thing but also provided too much distraction (exactly what I do not need during meetings) on the device for 3x the price. Add in a few of the features that I already loved on previous Kindle devices and I had to try it out. Here are my thoughts after some use:Pros- feel of the writing is very nice with very little lag (this was my biggest concern because previous Kindles tended to lag whenever using them)- the screen does not feel like a ""glossy"" screen when writing on it- backlit and ""paperwhite"" look to it which is huge if reading or writing in the sunlight- larger screen helps keep the book text and formatting closer to the true book (this was big for me with texts that have figures, tables, etc)- the overall speed and processing feels much faster than previous Kindles- portability of sending documents to the Kindle is very simple once you figure out the email address that you need to send it to- acts as both your eReader and eNotebookCons- the price- it does not replace your tablet- cannot write directly on book pages (you have to open a note window to write notes)Overall, it was worth the price to me. I think this appeals to the business/scholar that needs the capability of reading and writing on documents or the enthusiastic reader that loves their Kindle but wants a bigger screen with some extra utility of the writing/document features.

It is a great note taker but there‚Äôs definitely some room for improvement on the software side. See my full review here.The pen works really nicely on this device. The screen is not too slippery and feels very close to a pen on paper. The Kindle‚Äôs e-ink display adds some additional realism to the note taking experience. It of course also functions like the other Kindle e-readers and its large 10.2‚Ä≥ screen that works much better for large text vs. the smaller Kindles.There are two pen choices available. For my review I went with the version with the ‚ÄúPremium Pen‚Äù that has an eraser on the back and a button on the side that can switch to a different virtual pen type when its pressed in. The standard pen lacks those features. Both pens do not require batteries or charging and will magnetically attach to the side of the Scribe.My big issue with the Scribe is all on the software side. If you‚Äôre reading a book you can only place handwritten notes in a small box that embeds in a highlight on the page. The handwritten notes do not sync back to other devices but typed out notes do.If you have a PDF that you brought over via the ‚Äúsend to Kindle‚Äù mechanism, you can write directly on the page. Like the books the handwritten annotations will not sync back to your Kindle library but you can click the share button and email the PDF back to yourself with notes embedded.The Scribe also has a notebook/sketchbook feature. This has a number of templates that include lined paper, graphic paper, etc. In this mode the notes sync in their entirety back to your Kindle account and you can view those notes on any platform.

"Introducing Kindle Scribe (16 GB), the first Kindle for reading and writing, with a 10.2‚Äù 300 ppi Paperwhite display, includes Basic Pen",5.0,A modernized Kindle DX.,"Reviewed in the United States on December 18, 2022",Option: Premium Pen | Setup: 64 GB | Offer Type: Without Kindle Unlimited,True,"The Kindle Scribe is, in essence, a modernized, and long overdue, Kindle DX. It is a delight to read from it. The Amazon cover provides ample protection, provided that the machine be kept in one place. It offers three portrait-mode positions: easel, slightly tilted, and flat--and that is all one needs, in my opinion. One can, of course, lay the Kindle flat in landscape-mode, as well. One might want a more sturdy cover for use in traveling. I have not yet explored the note-taking possibilities of this Kindle. To be frank, I find that the fountain pen leaves any electronic note-taker in the dust, its sole disadvantage being that one cannot endlessly duplicate and manipulate one's copy, as one can with a well-programmed computer: and I understand, from other reviews, that the present note-taking software of the Scribe has a way to go. If I were a teacher, confronted by a bunch of students dressed as if for a slumber party, clacking away at their notepads or scratching away with their styli at their witch-pads, I just might throw a fit--but that would be my problem. As a musician, I compose and engrave my music at the computer; but I know how to make a score using pen and music paper. I do not believe that one can use computers effectively unless one is proficient in the use of the original tools for which the computer is a metaphor. I also believe that part of the wisdom of computer-literacy is knowing when not to employ a computer. But, I must say that the electronic book, together with electronic word-processing, number among the greatest inventions of mankind, comparable, in some respects, to the invention of the printing press; and the Kindle Scribe brings electronic reading to a new level.",2 people found this helpful

I‚Äôve enjoyed this Kindle more than any other.The large screen (even though it‚Äôs still at a 300dpi resolution) is a welcome update, and is reason enough for me to buy the Scribe. USB-C is nice to finally have, too. Its processing speed is much faster than my current generation Oasis. And I was actually able to download all of my ebooks from the Amazon Kindle cloud without the device rebooting‚Ä¶no trouble putting my entire library on the Scribe‚Ä¶600 books.What I did not expect was to enjoy the writing experience as much as I have. Sure, there are currently software limitations, which I assume will be fine-tuned over time. But the experience writing on the Scribe‚Ä¶better than my experience with the iPad Pros I have owned (I‚Äôve owned every generation of the iPad Pro, except for the current M2). The Scribe is a simpler writing experience than what is available on the iPads, but it seems so much smoother and feels like writing on paper. Sure, you can get that experience with iPad Pro and Apple Pencil, but it requires a matte screen protector, which then sacrifices iPad screen clarity, etc.What the Kindle Scribe has going for it is, out of the box, a terrific writing experience plus everything I love about the Kindle Voyage / Kindle Oasis / Paperwhite‚Ä¶especially the Kindle / Amazon ecosystem and book library.The Scribe does exactly what I hoped it would: it allows me to read my Kindle library on an amazing, large e-ink screen and write / take notes without distraction whenever I need to.Fantastic experience.

Now that I've had a few days to tinker, here are my thoughts:- First, the writing experience is great.  The higher resolution compared to the Remarkable tablet is noticeable, and the display is very responsive as you write.  The sound and feel of the digital ""pen"" on the surface isn't like paper on either device, but I prefer the Scribe.- It's very nice to read books on the same tablet I use for digital notebooks.- PDF export looks very nice, but Amazon puts the ""Kindle"" logo in the top right of your exported pages, and you can't remove it or opt out.  That's a little irritating.- The Remarkable has better-developed controls for writing instruments, pressure sensitivity, and ability to select, move, and scale things that you've written.  You can't do any of that on the Scribe; at least, not yet!- Unlike the Remarkable, the Scribe doesn't ask for a monthly subscription to access all its features- I have far more confidence that the Scribe or successor products will be around a decade or two from now.  That was always a concerns with the competing Remarkable tablet, coming from a startup with an uncertain future.  Amazon isn't going away any time soon, and that means my content probably isn't either.Overall, I'd pick the Scribe for its snappy display, ability to both read and write, better PDF export functionality (aside from irritating branding), and stability of the ecosystem.",4 people found this helpful

The feeling of writing on the tablet surface is also nice (although I don't love that they went the route of disposable tips that you have to keep buying).The touch screen element is much improved over the Kindle Oasis which wasn't super precise when typing. This one is more accurateWould have preferred if the eraser didn't need to be pushed down hard to erase - why not just have it touch and erase? Unneeded effort.The button for highlighting on the premium pencil is too low so if you want to highlight you have to bring your hand down the pencil - it's not the most ergonomic because of this.There is all this bezel on the one side - why not include buttons there like the Oasis? It was nice to do one handed page turns on that device. Particularly acute given the device is so large.Would be nice to mark up books directly and write in the margins rather than have this notes system but realize that's tough given it needs to display on multiple devices.Would be nice if you could multi-task - have half the screen be a note book and have the screen be the book so you can write an outline / notes in a separate document as you read to take away the key points - and then be able to turn that handwriting into textWhen you write handwritten comments on sentences in books, it only shows up on the Kindle Scribe - it doesn't show up on the iPhone / iPad version or the website.

However, there is a black circle on the left (or right side, depending on preference) that opens a toolbar and allows you to embed a handwritten note.  The black circle is distracting.  Once you see it, you can‚Äôt unsee it.  There needs to be a setting to remove it.The stylus is useless while reading e-books.

I would love to just play stuff.Would also love a magnet where you can lay your thumb or pen, so it can lock ontop of the Scribe, not just on the side.Finally, and this has been a big problem with just Kindle in general... let me read a book and listen to it at the same time. It's bad enough I have to buy the book TWICE, and there's no way to bundle those two in one payment from the same company, same product... but at least let me read and listen at the same time.I hope they open up the software a bit and allowed third party apps and or more customization. Great concept, great kindle, just hope they don't take years to update the software.",6 people found this helpful

"Introducing Kindle Scribe (16 GB), the first Kindle for reading and writing, with a 10.2‚Äù 300 ppi Paperwhite display, includes Basic Pen",2.0,Wait for the 2nd Generation or Buy a reMarkable,"Reviewed in the United States üá∫üá∏ on December 1, 2022",Option: Premium Pen | Setup: 64 GB | Offer Type: Without Kindle Unlimited,True,"I consider myself an early adopter. For example, I bought the first Blackberry for personal use back in 2004 (great) and the first Microsoft Surface Duo in 2020 (bad). I cite these items as examples of brands nailing it out of the gate (RIM) and others (i.e. Microsoft) missing the mark. The first Kindle Scribe sits closer to the Surface Duo than the Blackberry. Much closer than I would like to see; I do not recommend purchasing for now.I own a reMarkable 2 (yes, I did own the original as well). reMarkable checks so many boxes that the Scribe suffers greatly in comparison. That is, if you plunked down cash for the Scribe in your first foray into e-ink writing tablets, Amazon might feel just about right. Yes, it fits neatly into the Amazon ecosystem. For obvious reasons, you can read Kindle books only on Amazon devices or via the app on Amazon approved devices, e.g. Android or Apple phones and tablets.The Scribe has a serviceable note-taking function with various templates, and different widths for pens and highlighters. The Scribe also offers rudimentary organization via creation of folders. I didn't detect any latency when writing. That is, I didn't notice any lag between when the pen touched the screen and the line appeared. The screen itself felt wonderful, much closer to paper than to the glass of an iPad (hint: the Paperlike screen protector helps if you write on your iPad).This is NOT a review of the reMarkable or a recitation of its features but to offer some context, I cite to the more significant contrasts with the Scribe. Let's begin:1. The reMarkable is designed to take notes. Period. Full stop. There is no browser like the Scribe so you need to ask whether you consider web access useful or a distraction.2.  Storage. Presumably, Amazon will create an interface for cloud-based storage. I did not see any way to access such storage on the website or the Scribe but its difficult to imagine otherwise when all your books reside on Amazon's cloud. Remarkable is agnostic; you can store your notebooks on the reMarkable cloud OR you can link to Google drive, OneDrive (Microsoft), or Dropbox. This is probably the most significant advantage as you can upload Word or PDF files from your computer and access them from your reMarkable later for reading and annotating.3. Marking up files. The Scribe does not allow marking up books. You can write a note that ""attaches"" to a particular page but you cannot write on the page. I use my reMarkable to read and mark up documents. I can add notes or highlight like I would on real paper. I expect Amazon will permit this functionality on non-Amazon text, e.g. imported PDF documents.4. The Form Factor. The Kindle has a rather obnoxious amount of unusable space on the left side of the device (see photo). I have no insight into Amazon's design process but it does seem unusual to say the least.Bottom line - if you really want an e-ink writing tablet right now, buy something else. I think Amazon will offer a much improved second generation within a year or eighteen months.",55 people found this helpful

The goods:  I like the larger format reading (very surprised about that), I like the writing aspects (basic pen is fine), I like the synch of all to my iPhone app (books of course but handwritten notes too), I like the Case and the various ways it can be positioned, I like the integration of Kindle content and note taking, and I like the pen (basic).  The bads: (so to speak) I found it a bit too large in the beginning - I am adapting but I think a slightly smaller form factor would be an nice choice, I don't like the Cover's placement of the Pen holder (that loop is not natural at the bottom when its closed, and that's about it.So, overall this is five stars for me.

Toolbar drop down interruption a nuisance,"Reviewed in the United States on December 7, 2022",Option: Premium Pen | Setup: 32 GB | Offer Type: Without Kindle Unlimited,True,"I'm giving this three stars despite the fact that I'm actually very happy with ALMOST everything. I researched the device prior to purchase and was aware of its limitations. Hopefully, a convert handwriting to text function will be added soon. That's definitely a huge limitation, but I knew about it going in. One thing I'm quite disappointed about is how I CAN'T LOCK THE TOOLBAR WHEN I'M WRITING IN MY NOTEBOOK USING THE PEN. When I write towards the top of the page, unless I'm SUPER careful, my palm ends up touching the screen and triggering the toolbar to drop down, which freezes the notebook so that I have to stop writing and tap the screen with my finger to make the toolbar go away. It's a SUPER ANNOYING distraction that takes me out of the flow of what I'm doing. To avoid triggering it, I find myself not writing on the top third of the screen. That really stinks! And it's irksome to me because I feel like they could have easily added a toolbar lock button to the pen drop down menu BEFORE releasing the product. That way the notebook would be fully functional. I'm still going to keep using my device (daily) bc to me everything else works so well. It's a beautiful device. The large e-ink screen is striking and I love the extra space the 10.2"" screen provides.

I can't remember the last time I had any problem with a single one of my Amazon devices that warrantied me having to contact customer support, or return my order. This changed with the Scribe.First of all, I knew the device was limited in features and bought it anyway. I enjoyed having a large screen e-reader, and the limited writing features didn‚Äôt bother me. What did bother me was the lackluster support. I experienced a problem with note pages disappearing, and the support agents didn‚Äôt seem to realize that the Kindle Scribe even existed; referring to it as if it were exclusively an ebook reader, and not a writer as-well. Disappearing note pages are a massive bug, if I can‚Äôt trust the safety of my notes, then the ability to write notes might as well not exist for me.Additionally, their chat support lied to me about my trade-in being applied to the order. The customer support told me misinformation about the promotion, and then another lied about applying it to my order, forcing me to go through the ordeal of returning it. I haven‚Äôt had to contact amazon about most orders because things go so smoothly, but this has soured my faith in the company and I will personally be distrusting any statements made by the company henceforth (e.g that they will update the software on the Scribe).I am giving it 2 stars, the big e-ink screen was great for my digital university textbooks, non-fiction, and books with ample pictures, but nothing else. Too buggy to be trusted as a writer. And too expensive to be treated so poorly with my trade-in.With that in mind, I really hope they address the faults. When it works, it is excellent. The hardware is superb, and sparks joy. The sticky notes feature is a great annotation feature, and a pleasant surprise among the software limitations. In general, anything the Paperwhite did good, so did this. But anything added on top was mediocre to completely broken.To summarize my experience with this device, here is how I would describe it:‚Ä¢  Limited software features. Very convoluted PDF support with no way to markup PDFs without conversion.‚Ä¢  Buggy software that would randomly hang up. The most egregious is the ‚Äúwhispersync‚Äù service deleting note pages.

If you are a technical PM managing multiple projects this is the ideal tool to have with you during core team meetings and to carry around for in person discussions. Easy to scroll through pages and review previous notes. Many users complain about the lack of drawing options, and if you are an artist this will be a problem, but since the device does not support color you are probably already using a different tablet. Competing products also support OCR, but if you are taking technical notes that involve equations or other shorthand notation then you already know that OCR is garbage when trying to convert these to text. There are also comments on PDF markup support. If this is something you do routinely than a different e-ink solution will work better, but if you use Microsoft Office tools to generate deliverables than you are editing in the native application and printing to PDF for distribution. I need a device that has great battery life, is easy to carry around, and responsive. As an added plus it is also great for reading books.",

I am hoping it comes quickly. I decided to keep my Scribe in the hopes that we will see software updates to address some of the issues.***Edit***So far, rather disappointing.  I have bought several Kindles over the years and honestly, the best one to date is the Kindle Voyage I still use regularly, although it is getting painfully slow.  I have been wanting to buy a Remarkable 2 for quite a while, but the cost just didn't sit right w/me and when Amazon started promoting the Scribe I got very excited.  I could get my eInk note taking device and a new Kindle all in one.  I got it yesterday and was able to play w/it a bit.  The writing experience is very good.  But the note taking app is extremely basic. Just like a sheet of paper.  Nothing more.  You can't cut/paste/select, etc.  All functions that are pretty much expected on an electronic device.  Many people have commented this is 1st gen.  Honestly it feels more like pre-beta and many ways.As far as the Kindle part, I'm still deciding.  It is big and lying in bed reading was not nearly as natural or comfortable as my old Voyage. One issue is the placement of the power button.  I accidently turned it off at least 3 times because of the way I am used to holding my old Kindle and regular books.  As others have said, being able to do landscape with 2 side-by-side pages (re: a real book), would be much better.  Also, going from the old Kindle software version on my Voyage to the newer version really sucks.  That is one of the reasons, I don't like using my kids' Kindles.  They are newer and I don't like the new software.  We use a shared account and ALL of their old library books showed up on my Scribe, even though they had all been expired and/or returned.  I had to manually return over 100 books 1 at a time to get them to go away.Pros:  Backlight and Writing ExperienceCons: Note Taking and Kindle software is terrible and the power button is in a bad location.

I‚Äôd recently purchased the Onyx Boox Air Pro 2 and loved it. So why would I need a less versatile e-paper notebook/e-reader? In the end, it boiled down to my needs. Truth is, I didn‚Äôt NEED another tablet. I had an iPad. What I needed was a dedicated e-reader that I can use to write notes. So I took a chance. Bought the Kindle Scribe. And although I‚Äôve only had it a few hours, it‚Äôs everything I hoped it would be.The writing is fantastic. No lag time at all. The feel of writing is very satisfying with just enough resistance to feel like paper. Although it doesn‚Äôt have an easy way to share notes yet, I can do access them on my phone or iPad easy enough by going to the Kindle app.For the naysayers, understand. The Kindle Scribe is a Kindle first. A notepad second. I‚Äôm thrilled I don‚Äôt have a dozen apps clogging up my screen here like I did with the Boox Note Air 2. It‚Äôs simple. Easy to find things. And satisfying.Look, if you want an e-paper tablet, maybe the Scribe isn‚Äôt for you. The Boox is fantastic for everything you might want in an Android tablet. But if you want simplicity and just an e-reader you can jot down thoughts with, then I fully endorse the Kindle Scribe. I‚Äôm really impressed with it.",5 people found this helpful

Great hardware.2. Terrible software.3. No connectivity with cloud services.4. Limited writing tools reduce powerful hardware to the usefulness of a toy.5. It's just a big Kindle. Buy it for that, but only if you must.This is an update to my review below, now that I've had a chance to use the device for a week.I no longer recommend this device and will most likely return mine until Amazon delivers a product that can do something besides reading ebooks.The hardware is gorgeous as I said below.The software is horrible. I use some pre-made PDF day planner templates on the Remarkable that should work on the Scribe. They are about 15MB. No problem getting the PDFs onto the Scribe. However, the only way to get the PDFs off the Scribe is either via a USB cable or email. If you try emailing a 15MB document, it crashes Amazon's system and says the document did not go through. This makes the device almost useless.You can't annotate an ebook. You have to use their 'sticky' notes which only work on Amazon-purchased DRM books. You can't annotate epub or mobi format books. You can write on PDFs but as I mentioned you cannot share them off the device in any reasonable manner.Want to put your notes in nested folders? Forget it. Can't be done. You get one level of folders for notes. That's it. Want to book your non-DRM'd ebooks in folders? Forget it. Can't be done.The writing tools are extremely limited.My advice: Wait for version 2.0 when the software is updated to be actually functional not thrown on in time to release before Christmas. They put a lot of thought in the hardware, but they completely ruined the device with terrible software.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------I received my kindle scribe today. I also own a Remarkable 2. The kindle scribe is a larger kindle that also can be used for some light notebook features. It feels like a premium device in your hands. The physical design is excellent.It is challenging to organize your books and PDFs on the device, and then there is all Amazon's advertising on the home screen. The look and feel are definitely for leisure as opposed to serious work. The organizational features of the remarkable are way better. This can be fixed in software - Amazon needs to address this if they want to try and compete in the e-ink notebook space.The screen is gorgeous, crisp, and clear, and a beautiful backlight that can be adjusted to warmer or cooler, just like all the other kindles. While the scribe screen blows away the remarkable screen with better clarity and higher resolution, the writing experience is not as natural as the remarkable. The pen latency feels about the same, but the writing experience is closer to what you get on an iPad - writing on glass, whereas the remarkable feels about as close to writing on paper as you can get. The remarkable does not have a backlight, but in office conditions, you really don't need a backlight. The writing experience is quite good, just not up to how it feels on a remarkable.The notebook features are pretty limited, but the features that are available work very well.I recommend this device; just know that for serious writing and notetaking (at least for now), the remarkable is a better option. If you want a larger kindle and plan on mostly reading books and taking a few notes, then this device would be a better choice than the remarkable.Overall, I love it. I hope they add better features in software over time. If they do, this device would be a remarkable killer.",111 people found this helpful

That Amazon has released a half-baked product in time for Christmas doesn't leave me much hope that it will be updated with further features.Non-existent are handwriting recognition, I cant write on my paid for books, the inability to sync with other apps except a few like Office but no Google implementation is ridiculous. And, just being able to write sticky notes on my books sucks. These are all standard in the two I mentioned.It's been said that Amazon will update the software so I need to wait for how long when I can just buy the existing and refined two units?

Aside from the useless web browser feature and current limited features, it's a better option for reading books. Even with an antiglare screen for both tablets, my eyes still hurt from the ipad and samsung tablet. I hope they create the software update for this product soon...At this point, I probably should've purchased the Kindle fire for the split screen option.

After I got mine and I played around with it for 30 seconds I quickly found all the settings on how to fix those issues. I included pictures of where to find those setting as well as a video to help someone else out so they don't freak out thinking they have to restart their scribe every time they want to go to the homescreen.So far I like it, it's pretty easy to use and I like the fact that I'm able to have a notebook as well for when I get inspired or need to make a to do list.I will say it's a bit awkward to hold with only one hand since it does have a little bit of weight too it but is so thin and slick so I think that attributes to that. I have ordered a case where I'm able to slip my hand into the cover so hopefully that will help with that. It's not a deal breaker for me but just something to be aware of.For transparency I will say I got the 64gb version of the product, I'm not sure why my review states that I bought the 32gb.  I'm sure there is literally no difference between the 2 other than one having a 32gb chip and the other a 64gb chip.I forgot to add that the pen writes pretty smoothly but be prepared to loose it.

The writing toolbar has to be on the screen for this feature to work. It can be moved either to the left or right of the screen. It‚Äôs presence doesn‚Äôt bother me. I used the pen to write notes and it‚Äôs very smooth. You can also annotate my tying.3) it is a bit archaic to send your PDF to Kindle Scribe through your kindle email, especially since this the exact same way I had to send PDF to kindle ten years ago on my kindle keyboard.Other miscellaneous stuff:  I like the notebook feature but don‚Äôt see myself using much of it except when bored and want to doodle or vent.There is a setting for your recently read book cover to be your Lock Screen, which I thought was cool.All in all, I‚Äôm happy with my purchase. Even though there is definitely room for improvement, sending and receiving PDF documents should be much easier than sending emails.",25 people found this helpful

Figuring I had nothing to lose, I decided to try to use my phone as a hot spot to connect, and the kindle worked, connected to the store and web browsers. Also no more laggy behavior. So I looked at my Verizon fios g3100 router instructions and connected using the wps button on the front of the router, then pressed the wps option on the kindle instead of the connect button after entering the router password; and that worked.  The kindle now moves very smoothly, no lagging.. I traded in an Oasis that I  found to be perfect but I much prefer the scribe with the larger screen size.  The resolution and the light control is superior in my opinion.  The cost is without a doubt not what many will pay; the trade in and 20% off helped my decision immensely.  I do read more than most and utilize my public library to borrow ebooks so this was worth it to me.

I work in the call center industry, so we are constantly taking notes and reading reports/books. This device has taken my work to the next level! I suffer from Hyperhydrosis, which is excessive sweating of the hands/feet. Which if you can imagine, is difficult with traditional paper. When I read a book, or use a notepad, the corners will fold over time just from regular use. This has caused me to shy away from taking physical notes and caused my handwriting to suffer. Not anymore! The Kindle Scribe has reawakened my ability and love of writing. I no longer have to worry about smudging, folding corners, or ruined notes. A lot of people are going to benefit from this device in particular. The display is clear and crisp making reading great, and the writing/note taking is a joy. The distraction free approach to this tablet is perfect for it's intended use. BONUS points for the fact that Manga is extremely great to read on the Scribe. A typical Manga book is a little smaller than the Scribe so the pages are magnified around 10%. This makes small text even easier to read.

My current e-ink tablet, a Boox Note Air2, is almost unusable because of how slow it is. The Kindle Scribe feels like magic compared to the Note Air2 because there's *never* a lag on the Scribe. BUT: it's been nearly 3 months since the device was released, and there still hasn't been any kind of update to add the kind of functionality needed to make this a viable productivity tool.- you still can't add or remove pages from a notebook- you still can't jump to a specific page in a notebook- you still can't add multiple templates to a notebook (for example, page 1 uses a monthly overview template and page 2 uses a daily schedule template)- you still can't select and move text, or copy and paste text- you still can't see your last used notebook page as the screensaver--it will always default to the last ebook you've readI keep hoping for an update. But I've been waiting to use this thing as more than an e-reader since it arrived last November.

The display is incredible. 300ppi on this large of a display cannot be found elsewhere.2. The raw writing experience is superb. Latency is extremely low.3. This device is second to none if you care about reading PDFs, especially technical material like research papers or textbooks.4. There are obvious shortcomings in this initial software release that should be straightforward to resolve. Writing directly on book content is the biggest problem area. PDFs must pass through Amazon's Send to Kindle service to be preprocessed for the direct writing feature. PDFs loaded via USB are view only. The visual quality of the Send to Kindle PDFs is obviously inferior. They seem to be going through some type of conversion to an image format in order to make it easier to overlay handwriting. All the needs to happen is the following: render content normally in the background and use the existing notebook feature as a transparent foreground ""pane."" I think having notes at a particular text location isn't all that important: make the notes appear at a scale that is consistent with the default notebook and PDF sizing by default. In the e-book case: allow the user to draw directly at this same default page scale and then adapt the number of note pages if the content scale changes, inserting blank content pages if absolutely necessary to preserve existing notes. It should feel like scribbling in a physical book as much as possible.",7 people found this helpful

No Lasso tool- being able to move text around in notes really helps me, this basic function exists on all competitors products2. No ability to copy/ paste - i copy and paste extensively3. No handwriting recognition - searching notes is super helpful4. no custom templates5. no ability to view multiple pages of a notebook in summary view6. poor integration of gestures- more gestures would help for seamless navigation‚Ä¶things like switching between notebooks and switching from kindle to notebooks require too much work7. screen seems to refresh on me at times, id like to be able to control this and only have it refresh when I want8. id like to be able to set the amount of time before the thing goes to sleep- dont think i have explicit options to do this‚Ä¶eg 30 minutes to sleep9. this one i think relates to layers, but i find it annoying that the ruled lines of the notebook temporarily erase when you erase a selection10. cant program the eraser button to erase selection11. when you erase, there is often ghosting12. web browser is not good, most webpages i tried did not work well13. no email applicationHere are some of the things I‚Äôd like to see with this device but I‚Äôm not sure if its a hardware constraint:1. ability to use usbc port for headphones2. ability to use usbc or bluetooth for a keyboardI want to update my review to mention I have owned and used the Remarkable 2, Onyx Boox Note Air 2 and the Supernote A6x.

I saw the picture Amazon provided of the ""Garden Journal"" with the little drawing of the grasshopper and thought, ""This is cool.  I can use this as a journal.""NOT!This POS doesn't work that way at all.  It's essentially FALSE advertising.  All it does is allows you to click on a paragraph and WRITE your note (instead of typing it) and then the box closes.  You CANNOT see what you drew or wrote on the page unless you click on this itty-bitty icon on the page (which is very difficult to see).  I was HOPING I'd be able to write in the margins, write in journal areas (that some books have), and to draw pictures that I'd actually be able to openly see at all times when going through any given Kindle book.NOPE.  It doesn't work that way AT ALL.I'm not sure how they can, with an open conscious, show that ""journal"" page in their advertisement with the garden journal when you CANNOT draw on the Kindle pages that way.  (It would be nice if you could...but this POS wasn't designed that way at all.)  It's NOT much different than a regular Kindle except that it's MUCH BIGGER, thinner, and you can now WRITE your notes (instead of only typing them).  And that's about it.If I would have known that I couldn't ""journal"" in this (like a regular journal book with a pen) where I can openly see what I'm writing on with each page, I would have gotten a cheaper Kindle and would have been okay continuing to type out my notes (instead of writing them with a pen...which is hard to read your own notes anyway since the box is relatively small to write your notes in).Maybe wait until they FIX their software.  Don't be the ""first"" guinea pig to buy this (like I was).  Wait until they come out with the next version.  Maybe by then they'll be able to stand behind the screenshots they are misleading people to believe in how their new Kindle works (when it doesn't work that way at all).",5 people found this helpful

I suppose it‚Äôs so you can write on it but I will probably never actually use that feature so meh. Just wanted a Big Screen for my rapidly aging eyes. Wonder if I need to keep using blue light blocking readers? Finally, page turn buttons would be great. The screen is more sensitive and touch page turn easier than on others but come on Amazon the buttons were the best thing about early models and the Voyage and Oasis.

Yes the interface is scaled back and options are limited but what it does do as a note book it does well. Many of the additional feature could eventually be software updates (with the exception of pressure sensitivity which would need to be a gen2 feature). I think that this will be excellent for reading PDFs and taking meeting notes. If Amazon pushes some updates it could easily go from good to great as a digital note taking device.

FYI, I have been hoping for many years that Amazon would release a larger Kindle with this functionality, primarily so I may use it as a music reader. While the Scribe may be worthy of that role someday, currently it's just not ready for primetime - the software for writing functionality is embarrassingly plain and not really workable for anything other than scribbling digital post-it notes. I'm having a hard time believing Amazon declared this device ""ready"" for release.I'm not really adding much new, but here are the functions that are clearly lacking:-Syncing of notes/notebooks (must email them to yourself...is this 2008?) Once your annotated documents or notebooks leave the Scribe, no further editing is possible.-No pressure sensitivity! I really couldn't believe this one. It's even built into the stylus technology, so Amazon just chose not to include it.-Super sparse pen and pencil options. You basically get a pen at various thicknesses, that's it.-No layering, no built-in shape corrections (ex: draw a circle and it snaps to a perfect circle), no copy/paste whatsoever.-Can't write directly on books. You can't even use the highlighter to highlight books. You CAN use the stylus to long-press and drag, but this is just mimicking using your finger.-No way to search your notes. I don't really care about handwriting-to-text except for this functionality.-No quick and easy way to switch between notebooks and books.-I don't have high hopes for this one, but as a musician I would love to be able to draw on the staff paper template and have the software clean up the notation. Basically handwriting-to-text but for music notation.I think the hardware is excellent, and especially appreciate the ambidextrous nature as a lefty (part of why I have owned an Oasis for years.) But this is just not software implementation worthy of rewarding Amazon with any money at this point. So, the Scribe will be going back, with the hope that future updates will take this thing out of BETA and into the great device it deserves to be. Do better, Amazon!",8 people found this helpful

It was well before they started selling ebooks so probably a couple of decades now. I've had a few minor problems now & then but I am normally a very happy Amazon customer. In all that time I have never had such a terrible customer service response as I have had with the Amazon Scribe.When I 1st heard about the Scribe I was excited & eager to buy (even though this is pretty expensive for my budget). I pre-ordered it 10/6/22. It was supposed to be released the end of Nov. The Nov. release date came, the current listing changed to ""ship in 2 days"" but my order page still said I wouldn't get it till the end of December. It didn't make sense that people who waited to order it until after the release date would get it sooner than me, when I preordered it.I decided to order it on Best Buy (who had it in stock & ready to ship) and cancel my original order. But Amazon wouldn't me cancel. It was supposed to be in the getting ready to ship phase, even though it still said I wouldn't get it til the end of Dec. After SEVERAL phone calls, the Scribe was shipped to me & I got it around 12/7/22. I received a gift card for my trouble, which I appreciated. I thought that would be the end of it. But no, the saga continues.When I did finally receive it, I really loved the Scribe. It was great... Until it stopped working, only a month after I got it. 1/2 of the screen turned black & the other 1/2 froze on a page of text. Rebooting didn't work. I understand, duds can happen with any product, especially a new one. But the CS support I've received has been atrocious. I first called Amazon about getting a replacement on 1/6/22. It is now 1/14/22 and they still have not shipped the replacement. They don't even have a date listed of when they expect to ship.In one of my calls to Amazon, one of the CS reps I talked to, lied to me and said it was out of stock. I told him I could see the current listing and it showed it was in stock. I asked to speak to his supervisor, he refused and suddenly said it would be shipped in 2-5 days. But it's still not showing a shipping date on my order page so I think I've been lied to again.Meanwhile, I had to pay UPS an extra $15.34 to pick up my original Scribe to ship it back to Amazon. If I could finally get my hands on a Scribe that works & is reliable, maybe all of this headache would be worth it. But at this point, I don't know when that is going to happen.So to summarize, if you get a Scribe that isn't a dud, you'll probably love it.

Not for me, not ready for prime time.I've only had the device a few hours so I'll be sure to update later. These are my first impressions, and they are not good.Build Quality: Excellent. The screen has a completely forgivable border and is flush with where the metal comes up on the front. Aluminum suits the device nicely and feels premium. I wish the left-hand side made use of all that bezel though. No reason this couldn't have page turn buttons or a home button or something of the sort. Seems like such a waste of space.Writing: Fluid, responsive. Great response from my note taking and listing thus far. Some delays due to e-ink, but overall good or better than expected. A great start. When drawing, there doesn't seem to be any consideration for shading, which is a small bummer but really not the purpose of this device so I do understand.Software: A complete dumpster fire, honestly. I'm imagining Amazon designers having a conversation about adding a tab for ""Notebooks"" and calling it a day after coming up with folders and a few predictable page layouts. Completely lackluster and uninspired design choices here - like they just took the normal Kindle software from my Oasis and added the notebook tab, literally. For nearly $400, the software choices (or lack thereof) seem utterly thoughtless in regard to the type of device it is. Where are the obvious functions one would expect for writing? For example, detecting the written word, communicating actual text to other devices, having some software smarts, etc.?? Why on earth did Amazon forgo partnering with Evernote or Notability or Goodnotes, or any other company for that matter to make this thing more useful? I understand wanting a distraction-free experience, but doing so at the cost of practicality seems ridiculous when the Remarkable 2 does so much more and costs less.I am genuinely going to try to use this product and present only thoughtful, specific criticisms moving forward but so far, I'm really shocked by Amazon's lack of software prowess this far in the game.

The stylus has a very nice feel in the screen -- smooth, but not too slippery, the screen illumination is flawless, the inking is delightful.

They both have better software (synch options, layers), but the kindle integration is nonexistent on Remarkable, and merely ok on Supernote. By far the most important benefit of the Scribe for writing is the fabulous backlight.The software for writing on the Scribe is very minimal.  It seems like they rushed this out for the Christmas season before they had properly finished the software support.  There is VERY primitive ""backup"" via email and no syncing at all.  I *assume* (hope!) this will improve over time.Even with the primitive software it's functionality is good enough for me.

I am a hardcore Apple user with multiple devices and desktops, but nothing beats the Scribe.Also great that it automatically backs up to all my Kindle devices so I can read what I have written from my iPhone.Amazon, if you're reading this, here's my requests for the next software upgrade:1. Give us true nested folders so we can organize our many notebooks.2. Allow us to copy and paste handwriting, as well as move and insert individual pages.3. Let us adjust the amount of time before the screen times out.4. Fix the palm sensor so it does not move a page when I first set my hand down on it.Even with these issues, it is my first choice!

I previously owned the Oasis, and the screen on said device was just too small for my person taste.Because it is a Kindle, this is first and foremost a reading device for me.

I really liked that it also allowed me to use it as a standard kindle to read books but that is about the only feature I like. The writing is clunky especially when I get near the edge of the notebook so I have to leave a good amount of space to the side of notes because it is unusable. I've tried everything but it tends to have a mind of its own when I try to write in that area and often comes out illegible. The picture shows an example of this I have written ""hello"" down the whole right side using the same handwriting not applying any different pressure or changing anything up and they were written in sequence one after another and in some places it is fine but in others it is a mess and it is always these spots that I cannot write without issue.Another issue is the change pages area is very sensitive and often when I am in the middle of writing something my arm bumps the edge of the page it will flip and I'll be writing on a new page. Overall, I think it was a good idea and I like the functionality, the ability to read and take notes as well as upload and markup PDF's is nice. However, the execution just isn't there. I wish I had returned it but I really wanted it to work so I kept using it hoping I would get passed the issues.I suggest you don't waste your money, maybe a future version of this will be better and work better but I think I will be getting an iPad.",One person found this helpful

Love the feature that you can handwrite notes - read your own notes on your own handwriting feels special vs reading the typewritten words. Personal touch vs standard machine format.One simple thing for improvement for the software developer: when I start a new note, I select a format and I expect the page launch right after I touch the format. But no, I will have to fab the ""create"" which is just not smooth. Samething on the passcode after waking up the device - after key in 4 digit, why  not just launch already but have to tab the ""enter"" key?

There are lots of template choices, the pen works well, and it will make a great notebook for someone who is looking to have a digital notebook on hand.The Kindle portion is basically a separate entity from the notebook portion.  It works exactly as do all the other Kindles (which is fine -- they work well), with one small aspect differing -- when you make a note, you can write it instead of type it.  That's all.  That's the only thing the pen does in books.  You can't highlight with the pen in a book (still got to do with your finger) nor can you write in the margins or on the page.  The process of making a notation was not updated in any way, so it's still as clunky as ever.  I bought this with the expectation of being able to make notes in my ebooks like I do in my physical books.  I obviously misunderstood the advertisements, and maybe this review will keep others from making the same mistake.Edit: Amazon called me twice yesterday wanting more details, but I really don't have any more to give.

Writing is ok, but I couldn't see myself using this in class or studying. PDF transfer is a joke. I had hoped a device like this would prompt upgrades or improvements but not.This is to doodle. This is not to study. This is for quick meetings or if you use Kindle for textbooks. That's it.Edit: Amazon called me three times today to give more info, so here it is:I pre-ordered as soon as the scribe came out, expecting a premium experience. Instead it seems like a big Kindle, where the writing was added as an after thought. The writing is smooth yes, but there's no colors, no syncing, no quick way to send and annotate PDFs. It took 5 minutes on WiFi to have an 8 page PDF get sent from my phone to the Kindle Scribe (I have fiber wire terabyte Internet and WiFi 6). I then had to download it directly to the Scribe as the phone kindle app would not let me directly send it? Like I can on every other Kindle üôÑ.It's a disjointed and slow, outdated experience. I had higher hopes a billion dollar company of Amazon would do better than a small European company like Remarkable, but it seems the hardware is there, and the software for forgotten. I can't tell if it was rushed and shipped before the software was finished, but the note writing seems little better then short notes. No colors, no exports. No transferring my notes easily to other devices. No syncing and sharing my meeting notes as I can on remarkable.It's a blisteringly disappointing experience for the price. I truly hope the second generation is better, but unfortunately it shows how disconnected Amazon is from the customer type who'd want this device.I waited several months for this, and Amazon squandered it.

This sends your files through amazon and eventually to your email after an extensive amount of time. Not only that, but the services will add content to the files, particularly the file name in the top left corner. THIS CANNOT BE REMOVED OR DISABLED.If you try to transfer your note files to your PC via the provided USB-C cable, they will be in an unreadable format.Another fun fact: in the kindle scribe notebook filing system, you CANNOT have a file within a file... the most basic function anyone could ask for. I haven't even mentioned the incompatibility with most textbooks and limited note formats, but I feel other reviews cover those shortfalls well. I recommend viewing those.Even when not considering the terrible file management and issues with file transfers, you are buying a $400 black and white version of Microsoft paint. $20 can get you a notepad and pens of varying thickness. For 20x the price, that is exactly what you are buying here.The only part remotely ok about this device is the hardware. You will not see any pixels. However, in the attached image that there is a discoloration around the border of the device.

I'm not sure that the print itself is actually any bigger than it is on smaller Kindles. The only thing that's changed is you can fit more words on a page with the larger screen. But that's not what I wanted. I want to make the font bigger and sacrifice some screen real estate, flip pages more often. But the device won't let me.I can read the text with font and boldness maxed out, but not comfortably, not enough for it to be an enjoyable experience.And what really makes zero sense?

Sadly, the note-taking software is literally the worst on the market.  The two-year-old Remarkable is far superior to the Scribe.  The Kindle-side of this gadget is exactly like all of the other Kindles (except big and heavy for a Kindle) and yet none of your book notes transfer to the other Kindles.  Even worse, you cannot easily use the notebook to take notes on a book you are reading without 5 clicks.  You can't take notes on an Audible book at all.It is FALSE ADVERTISING to say that you can take notes on a PDF.  No, Amazon converts your PDF to some other form that you can take notes on which means they have a copy of the docs you send them.  There is also inconsistency in note-taking ability when it comes to how you choose to transfer your PDF to the Scribe.  On some, you can take notes.  Others, you cannot.The note-taking capacity does not exceed that of pen and paper in any way except for the bulkiness of paper.  You cannot copy and paste, create sub-folders, move folders, convert text, use different pen types...This list could go on quite awhile.I was so excited to receive this gadget and so disgusted at how little effort Amazon put into the note-taking software.",8 people found this helpful

You have to choose, and if you choose listening, you must use headphones. I found that I brought my iPad along whenever using the Scribe so I could listen and read.  Last, I had difficulty with the page blinking when you turn a page. No ability to look ahead as with the easy kindle format on iPad. Overall it just did not work for my reading style.

The Scribe saves a notebook as PDF and can then email it. That in itself isn't a problem, but note taking and only emailing is very limited.

The roll out of the new Kindle Scribe has been bumpy, from my vantage point.  I pre-ordered back in September.  I am/was using a reMarkable tablet for taking notes; I work from home in customer service and didn't like wasting paper.  I also really wanted a larger screen for reading Kindle books, and thought the Scribe may work.It was supposed to be delivered on launch day, 11/30/2022.  I then got a notice it was delayed until 12/1, then 12/2.  By 12/5 it was sitting in Illinois (I'm in Texas) with no clear ETA, when I cancelled the order.  I tried again last week, since it was shipping, and arrived on 1/4/2023.Set up was a breeze, and I like the way the pen felt while writing.  With the case, it was a bit heavier than the reMarkable tablet, but not too much.  I like the backlight, so I can write without a lot of ambient light.The next snafu came when I visited the Amazon site today.  The product I just received on Wednesday was now $45 cheaper -which was conveniently brought to my attention on Amazon's home page.  Amazon does not offer any kind of post-purchase price matching.  The only thing I could do was to start a return on the one I just purchased, and buy a new one at the cheaper price.  I even asked if I could return the unopened one so it could be sold without a discount, but was told the return was tied to the serial number.So, I'm sending back a perfectly good product.  It's going to a UPS drop off, so other than gas, costs me nothing.  They'll waste some packing material and the overall cost of transporting it back to Amazon.  Meanwhile, Amazon gets to send me a new one, with all the packing and shipping costs associated (but not for this Prime member).

I can't sort the data on the kindle to match the data on the computer for digital orders.  So doing any comparison of missing items is difficult (intentional?)6.  Erase feature is terrible, Why Can't I select a circle or something to delete large text area vs. having to us the eraser to erase a small section at a time (wow, painful).7.  When writing notes on the page it requires you to rest your hand on the screen; however, any movement of your hand and it will move to a new or backward to a previous notebook page.  Making taking notes very difficult.8.  The magnetic connection to the case is simply not strong enough.  If you tilt the scribe case at about a 45 degree angle the scribe will fallout with the slightest jolt.  if upside down the scribe doesn't stay in the case.

Sadly, instead of taking advantage of the larger screen, Amazon just inflated the UI of the smaller kindles and called it a day.1. THE LAG. It's awful to use, and requires patience even to browse the kindle store. Reading is snappy, writing is limited but fine, but the UI is sooooo slow.2. There are just 2 writing options (besides size). Pen or highlighter. No styles, no ""pencil"", just pen and highlight. This is an expensive device, and they hyped the pen input enough that I expected it to be a worthwhile addition, not an afterthought.3. No scribbling or highlighting with the pen in a book. I've stuck with paper for a while because I always write in my books. Here the only option is a tiny little note icon that opens a small space to write in.

"Introducing Kindle Scribe (16 GB), the first Kindle for reading and writing, with a 10.2‚Äù 300 ppi Paperwhite display, includes Basic Pen",1.0,An absolute waste of almost $400!  Why would anyone use this??,"Reviewed in the United States üá∫üá∏ on December 3, 2022",Option: Basic Pen | Setup: 16 GB | Offer Type: Without Kindle Unlimited,True,"What a silly device this is.  It does absolutely nothing as well as an Ipad, is completely redundant, and doesn‚Äôt do the few things it was designed to do very well.1.) I bought this because my friend had a Remarkable device and I was impressed with that device and the ability to take and keep good notes. This is a very weak competitor for the Remarkable because the writing function is not any better than writing on an Ipad.  It is extremely hard to write neatly on it.2.) Reading on this device does not work well.  Magazines are badly laid out and difficult to navigate.  They do not look like magazines and navigation is not as intuitive or attractive as it is on an Ipad.  And‚Ä¶..they are only in black and white.3.) I signed up for Kindle Unlimited thinking I could download the books I wanted to read. Nope. None of the books I am interested in are available there.4.) Have a subscription for your digital paper on your Ipad?  Well be prepared to pay for it twice if you want to read it on your Kindle.5.) There is no time that I could be happy only using a Kindle.  I would always have to have my Iphone or Ipad with me as well.  And there‚Äôs nothing this device does as well.  So why pay almost $400 for it?Bottom line:  This device is poorly conceived and designed.  Anyone who likes to use a Kindle to read will do much better with a much less expensive and simpler Kindle.  For anyone who wants more, this device will not provide it.  I don‚Äôt even think my Mom - who was a voracious reader and writer - would see much value in this device.  For me, it‚Äôs an easy no thank you.  I‚Äôll return it immediately.",26 people found this helpful

What does that have to do with the Kindle Scribe?You can't stop the screen from switching to a generic screensaver image after a few minutes. That's right, you can't tell it to not go to screensaver or set the time before it kicks on -- which is crazy because it takes more energy to switch to the generic image than it does to continue to display your notes or what you're reading.Why would Amazon do this? Because if you could tell the Kindle not to go to screensaver, you would never see advertisements. So you're in the middle of taking notes and you look away for a moment and then when you look back... screensaver. You're trying to show somebody something, screensaver. Reading, screensaver.The Scribe doesn't have ads yet but obviously they're coming -- so Amazon can't let you control the screensaver, as it is with with the other Kindles.

I took a chance on this one, finally, as the ability to make notes made it very attractive to me. However, I have two issues with this device, as a person with severe myopia.Although the text can be sufficiently enlarged, reading on this device is not pleasant. The actual screen, with brightness turned up all the way to maximum, is actually still a GREY color. The text is a very dark charcoal GREY. What happened to black and white? The lack of basic contrast makes me have to strain to read it. The second issue for me, as a visually impaired person, is that the system text as well as the text in the store, including book descriptions and whatnot, is small. There is one adjustment you can make from teeny-tiny to tiny, and that's it.When I compare the combination gray screen and charcoal text to a hard-copy book, the difference is striking. A book's pages are white for the most part, and the text black. And, of course, compared to my laptop or tablet, even more striking, as I have the back-lit white background with black text..Why is the ""paper"" on the Kindle not actually WHITE? And the text, not actually BLACK? And to be clear, I purchased two of these Kindles and compared both, so it is not just a defect in mine. It has been designed that way.

My main reasons for doing so were this was engineered by a right handed person for right handed people. My left palm kept hitting the back button while taking notes which was incredibly annoying.The other reason is that there is no ability to create subfolders within folders, which I need to organize my notes. The memory and back-lit screen are superior to the Remarkable but if you're like me and are trying to get away from paper notepads the Remarkable has the edge IMO.

While Amazon has promised updates with new features, I have my doubts these updates are imminent. There is a big gap that needs to be address. Some examples below:1. PDF upload workflow. You need to send PDF files through Amazon to allow note taking features for that document. There are several reasons (speed and security) why this is not acceptable. It takes time for the PDF to arrive on the device.2. File organization is very shallow. You cannot nest sub folders within folders. This is basic stuff.3. The writing experience is very basic. No handwriting recognition. You cannot move or adjust your writing to better organize your notes. The hardware appears to support pressure sensitivity, but this barely registers on the device.If you are wanting a Kindle device with a large screen for reading purposes only, this is a great option for you. Overall, it feels like a first gen device that is half cooked.

I charged it overnight with my own charger because the scribe did not come with the charger itself, only the cord. In the morning when I went to use it it was at 100%. After about an hour I turned it off and I noticed the Scribe turned itself back on and then off and on and off and it continued doing that all night to the point that it drained the battery down to about 17% by morning. That's not to mention the on/off light kept waking me up. I am returning it and I'll wait to see if the second generation produces a better product.

You can 'sideload' (send via usb) a '.mobi' version of an epub, and the kindle scribe will read it.  The only problem is that the note taking functionality (THE ONLY REASON YOU BOUGHT THE KINDLE SCRIBE!) does not work.  This is a huge problem.  You should be able to sideload your epubs (even if there is some local file conversion to a kindle scribe friendly format) and use them immediately.  Completely unacceptable in my opinion.

I've owned a few Fire tablets and iPads over the years .What I like:Incredible text resolution. This makes whatever you're reading really pop. The e-paper screen is fantastic and the battery life is unbeatable.The ability to adjust the warmth of the backlight. Eases strain on the old eyeballs when reading in the darkThe feel of writing on the screen. There is just enough texture on the screen that it feels like you're writing on actual paper, something other tablets can't do without a special screen protector.Endless selection of books on the Kindle store.What I don't like:Can't write directly on book pages. You're forced to add a ""sticky note"" instead of being able to markup a page directly. Extremely janky and annoying and unintuitive. Give me the option to write directly on the pages like I could with a real book.Sending documents or e-books to the Kindle is also janky and annoying. For example, I had an ebook on my computer that I wanted on the Kindle. It was a compatible format (which is a pretty limited list right now). I went to the device page on Amazon, sent the file to my Kindle... And then couldn't get it to appear on my Kindle. Took a few tries and eventually it showed up in my library. I was able to open it and read it, no problem. Still couldn't write on the pages, had to use sticky notes. Next day I go to pick up where I left off and the book won't open. I tried everything. Ended up deleting it, which means I lost my sticky notes on it as well. Super frustrating.The automatic backlight brightness jumps around too much, or sometimes not enough.For the price, it's not really worth it right now. The added function of being able to write on it is negated by the restrictions on where and what files you can write on. These are software fixes that Amazon's engineers hopefully implement soon. If they fix the dislikes I have then this is a 4 or even a 5 star device. Until then it's just mediocre.",One person found this helpful

I have a reMarkable and the lack of backlight is one of the two things that keeps it from being perfect. The other is lack of Kindle app. So I thought the Scribe might be the answer to my problems.+ the writing experience is pretty good, feels goodThe disappointing and bad:- big selling point was the ability to make handwritten notes. I understood before purchase I would not be able to write ON the kindle books. Fine. The trouble is that once I make the handwritten notes using sticky-note feature, they don't sync to my other kindle or the kindle app. Typewritten notes do. The handwritten notes - as far as I can tell - can ONLY live on the Scribe if you want to see them in context, or you can export out of context. This matters to what I call ""power users"" because we might be teachers, writers, academics, etc., who need to access those notes more easily and in context to actually make the device useful.- other big selling point is the notebook features, where you can use it as a digital notebook. this has lots of promise, but the notebook part is SOOO lacking in features. You can't insert pages where you want them, you can't lasso text to move it around, you can't see an overview of the notebook (that is, have a view where you can see all the pages laid out in thumbnails, as on remarkable and supernote). You can't do much but write on it and undo or erase.- a personal beef related to notebooks: the templates are too dark. Templates such as dot-grid, graphs, lines, etc., should not be as dark as the writing you're going to put on them, but they pretty much are.I hope and assume that future software updates will address all or a lot of this, but I'm not convinced that will be very soon. I'm returning it for now and will keep an eye out for improvements.On the up side, the notebooks at least sync very quickly and easily to kindle mobile app, which could be handy.There is future promise here, but other companies are doing this better for now. Look into the Supernote (amazing notebook features and you can put Kindle app on it), the reMarkable (great for work productivity), and Boox devices (especially for Android fans).As a side note, mine came with some kind of defect where it looks as though someone wrote something, perhaps with the wrong kind of stylus, and it left a pretty obvious ghost.",6 people found this helpful

Rows after rows of 'discover' that I have no interest in and no way to get to my notes on the home screen.  Seeing that screen is a big deterrent every time you wake the device. My handwriting is significantly worse on the scribe compared to the remarkable. The stylus feels more like writing with an Apple Pencil than the feeling of pen and paper, which the other device just nails.And then there is the cover. Whoever came up with that folding-up origami design did not take the time to spend a day with that cover. It is impossible to know which orientation it is in, and I always get it wrong.

A tap doesn't do it. A swipe may do it, or it may not. You may not be able to turn the page at all. Also, you can't put the PDF in landscape mode, so if the type is too small for you, your only option is to pinch and zoom, which is a terrible reading experience.

"Introducing Kindle Scribe (16 GB), the first Kindle for reading and writing, with a 10.2‚Äù 300 ppi Paperwhite display, includes Basic Pen",3.0,Excellent Reader. World's WORST Notebook,"Reviewed in the United States on December 8, 2022",Option: Basic Pen | Setup: 16 GB | Offer Type: Without Kindle Unlimited,False,"The hardware is glorious, but the note taking and internet browser software is a total joke. Seriously, in its current form, Scribe cannot be used for serious note taking. The pen and screen are awesome. If the following changes/features are added, the Scribe will become a note taking powerhouse.1. The FLYOUT MENU needs to be free floating so that it can be dragged anywhere on the screen or, at the very least, up and down along the margins of the page.2. The FLYOUT MENU should have an ‚Äòintelligent avoidance‚Äô setting that, when on, the menu moves out of the way as you draw (write, print, etc.) close to it. For example, if I'm writing on lined paper, as I fill up lines, the menu should drop further down on the page when my writing get‚Äôs within two lines or ¬Ω inch of it.3. The FLYOUT MENU needs an auto-close setting so that (if turned on) after a selection is made from the open menu, the menu closes.4. Add a ‚Äòscratch to delete‚Äô feature so that a user can delete something just by scratching it out. This is a well-trained practice among people that take notes on paper with pen (which is most note takers) and so feels much more natural than flipping the pen over to use the eraser or else using the side button.5. Add a touch gesture ‚Äì two fingers on the page causes the pen tip to act as an eraser.6. Add a touch gesture ‚Äì two fingers double tapping the page causes UNDO - subsequent double taps keep 'undoing'.7. Add a selection to the FLYOUT menu with three different grab types: oval, rectangle, and magic wand. This allows the user to select what is written on the page.a. Once a selection is made, a new menu should appear that gives users the following tools to affect the selection. ADD TO SELECTION; DELETE; COPY; MOVE; SCALE; STRETCH; VERTICAL FLIP; HORIZONTAL FLIP; ROTATE CLOCKWISE; ROTATE COUNTER CLOCKWISE; SEND.b. Creating a selection can be done through multiple grabs ‚Äì when in selection mode, tapping the page with two fingers puts the selector tool in ‚Äúadd‚Äù mode (same as ADD TO SELECTION) so that whatever the user selects next is added to (instead of replacing) whatever is so far selected.8. Add DELETE CURRENT PAGE to FLYOUT MENU9. Add INSERT PAGE HERE to FLYOUT MENU ‚Äì this adds a page to the notebook in front of the current page.10. Add MOVE PAGE to FLYOUT MENU ‚Äì this allows the user to move this page to any page position in the current notebook or any other notebook or using it to create a new notebook.11. Add COPY PAGE to FLYOUT MENU ‚Äì this allows user to keep the page on a clipboard and paste it in this or any other notebook12. Add CLIPBOARD to FLYOUT MENU13. Allow templates to be selected for each page, NOT merely for each notebook. This way, a notebook can have different templates from one page to the next. Creating a new page should default to the template used on the previous page.14. Add ORIENTATION to FLYOUT MENU ‚Äì Landscape and Portrait orientation needs to be available for each page so a notebook can have different orientations from one page to the next. Creating a new page should default to the orientation used on the previous page. Creating a new notebook should ask orientation for starting page. Changing orientation of an existing marked page should cause user to be asked the following question IF the change in orientation interferes with the existing markings: YOUR EXISTING WORK DOES NOT FIT THE NEW PAGE ORIENTATION. DO YOU WANT TO SCALE OR CUT OFF YOUR WORK?15. Highlighter needs three shades ‚Äì yellow, blue, pink ‚Äì and map them onto the PDF standard so that the color is properly represented when exported to pdf and viewed on a color screen.16. Allow audio clip insert.17. Allow speech to text(dictation) insertion on page, into keywords, and on notes.18. Allow direct text insertion anywhere on the page ‚Äì this is not an object on a layer so, once added to the page, it is not editable as text ‚Äì it becomes just another part of the markings on the page. But. When inserting the text, the text is typed, can be moved around, edited, font, size, kerning can be changed. It behaves as though on a layer until it is completed and pasted to the page.19. Automatically generated Table of Contents (TOC) with hyperlinks:a. Add TITLE and SUBTITLE pen-type to pen writing tool.b. Text written with ‚Äòtitle‚Äô or ‚Äòsubtitle‚Äô pen-type causes an automatic entry into a self-generating table of contents. The table of contents simply lists all lines of text written in title and subtitle weight, replicating the line (but scaled smaller), and acting as a hyperlink to the corresponding page of the notebook.c. Tables of contents are automatically generated and cannot be edited directly. Any change to the notebook involving existing titles or subtitles (whether they are modified, deleted, moved on the page, moved to another page, or subject to page insertions or deletions) is propagated to the TOC automatically. Clicking on a TOC entry takes user to the corresponding page.20. Add INSERT NOTE to FLYOUT MENU ‚Äì it functions exactly as it does on books except that, to start creating a note within a notebook, you select the INSERT NOTE from the flyout menu then tap anywhere on the page where you want the NOTE to be bound. This then launches the note creation dialogue box which functions exactly like it does for books.21. Add KEYWORDS ‚Äì keywords can be added to any title, subtitle, or page. Keywords can be searched for within a notebook or across selected notebooks. Keywords remain bound to their particular objects. For example, is a keyword is bound to a title and the title is deleted. That keyword is also deleted. If the title is moved or copied to another page, that keyword is also moved or copied.22. Add FIND button to FLYOUT MENU ‚Äì this allows user to search all notes and/or keywords within a notebook or across selected notebooks and then jump to the desired instance.23. Long pressing on the page number of a page brings up notebook navigation, allowing user to jump to a different page by selecting from a mosaic of pages or else entering page number.24.  When the FLYOUT MENU opens, also open whatever submenu was last accessed.Give me these abilities, and I will be very happy indeed! But as it stands, the Scribe is not suitable as a replacement to pen and paper. Not even close.",2 people found this helpful

What is wrong with people? Quit comparing this to tablets and enotebooks. Of course it doesn't have the same features! This is an ereader with note-taking capabilities and it does both outstandingly! If your looking for a tablet just buy a tablet for goodness sake. There are some of us out there that love to read and take notes and this Kindle is perfect for it. Alot of people said it was heavy, not! For its size its quite light and easy to hold. From all the negative comments I was expecting it to be as heavy as my 10"" tablet and its less than half that weight.Pros:Build qualityScreen qualityScreen sizeWriting experience (very close to the feel of pencil on paper)Amazing pen with magnetGood selection of note templatesEasy navigationLightweight for the sizeCons:You can only make sticky notes in Kindle books and not write or underline in the actual bookNo cut, copy or paste in the notebooksThese are minor issues to me and maybe they will add these features in the updates.Overall this was made for book people. If your a book person then you'll probably love it. If your not a book person, read the description for the product, stick to tablets (ie; this is not comparable or in the same class as an iPad or remarkable 2 and its not supposed to be) and quit leaving bad reviews.One last thing, I have always been a diehard page turn button person and thought I would hate not having buttons, but I'm actually happy it doesn't have them. I feel buttons would just get in the way and the screen is large enough that you don't have to turn pages as often and swiping feels like turning the page in a real book.

The Scribe makes it super easy to send all your notes to an email, which has definitely come in handy when it was time to write my review.Being able to write and highlight directly on pdfs has been great.I love the notebooks and the different style templates included. I've used them to take notes for physical books I've read as well as for meetings at work. The pen works well, and I love the built-in eraser and the fact that it never needs to be charged.As an avid book reader and reviewer, the Scribe has been a game changer.

Finally, it's arrived and it's perfect- as an e-reader. Magazines are especially great on the Scribe, with the larger fonts not looking out of place versus smaller devices. If you wear glasses and have been using smaller kindles, you will love the Scribe. It's not that much more in price than the most recent Oasis when it first came out. You will notice I haven't referred to the note-taking aspects. Why? Well frankly, that's due to some severe limitations, that I knew about going in. Ideally, I would like to be able to make notes in margins of books/magazines- but that's not how this is implemented. Think more sticky notes with it's own folder. Also, when making notes outside of books for lists or reminders etc- the switching from book to notes is not intuitive. You can not even edit a note after sharing it from the Scribe even using a kindle app. Basically, the Scribe converts the notebook into an image/PDF file for sharing. Big not much use if you can't edit. Still, the potential is there with future software updates. For the reading experience including the Kindle Store and was of finding books/magazines of interest at an affordable price, you can not beat the Scribe.",

My Collections appeared under Library. Then my Scribe began to work normally.  The download speed is fast!  I downloaded hundreds of my books in about 20-30 seconds each.  I love the screen, because it is like reading a hardcover book. Also, the screen conveniently displays twice as many books & collections on a page as my Paperwhite 2021 or Oasis 2.  I have 24 collections. I like seeing a lot more information on one page.  Doubling the storage of my Paperwhite is another gain & having a battery twice as good as on my Oasis 2 (Amazon‚Äôs Kindle site specifies the battery life of 6 weeks for the Oasis & 12 weeks for the Scribe) is a major gain, especially because I find the battery life on my Paperwhite 2021 (specified on Amazon at 10 weeks). I find I do use the pen often to make notes on my reading, because it is easier than the hunt &-peck for letters on the keyboard. I took a typing class, so my fingers know where the letters are, but I don't & my fingers don't fit on the keyboard. I want a cover but I have ordered a cover that opens like a book cover, not vertically like a stenographer's notebook.  Then my Scribe will be even easier to hold than a hardcover with hundreds of pages.  Another benefit is that there are no ads costing $20 to have removed.  However, most of the Home screen is cluttered with ads posing as recommendations of books.  It is more expensive than my 17‚Äù Lenovo laptop!  I do miss page turn buttons, for which there is plenty of room on the wide margin of the Scribe.  I expect that software improvements will increase the usefulness of the Scribe.  I gave up waiting for Amazon to introduce an Oasis 4 with a battery as good as the Paperwhite 2021 & an 8"" screen made by lengthening, not widening the device. I traded in my Oasis 2 for a $75 credit & 20% off a Scribe.  Users of back-lit tablets overlook the genius of front-lit e-ink & e-paper.  In fact, any back-lit device (TVs, monitors, cell phones) needs to be lit in order to read or use in any way, which produces eye strain from the light shining into one‚Äôs eyes. I read my Kindles mostly by available light, whether daylight or lamplight. I do most of my reading at home, but I still have my 2021 Paperwhite for travel & reading in waiting rooms.",3 people found this helpful

"Introducing Kindle Scribe (16 GB), the first Kindle for reading and writing, with a 10.2‚Äù 300 ppi Paperwhite display, includes Basic Pen",5.0,The best Kindle ever!,"Reviewed in the United States üá∫üá∏ on February 18, 2023",Option: Premium Pen | Setup: 32 GB | Offer Type: Without Kindle Unlimited,True,"I've been a Kindle fan from day one, but it always bothered me that the e-Ink models were much smaller than the (color) Fire models.  My main complaint was that although you could adjust the fonts of traditional eBooks, Send-toKindle / PDF documents were much harder to view on a smaller screen.Thankfully the Scribe has a beautiful 10.2"" display with a super crisp 300 pixel per inch resolution, which gives the look of a paper page.  Unlike a traditional tablet or computer display, it uses electronic ink that only draws power when the image changes, so the battery lasts for weeks or even months, depending on how actively you use it.PDFs and books look AMAZING... and unlike a traditional tablet display, electronic ink looks like real paper even in bright sunlight.  I've been uploading product instruction manuals for years using the Save to Kindle feature so I can throw away user guides.When you look at your library, you get a mixture of documents, books, and Audible audiobooks.  I've got about 1200 Audible audiobooks, so my main library has more audiobooks than printed books in it, but you can easily filter out the view to show whichever type you are looking for, or simply search.  There is no headphone jack, but it's easy to pair a Bluetooth headset to listen to your Audible library.With that in mind, Amazon added something truly new this time... the STYLUS!The Stylus comes in two versions, one has an extra button, which is pretty handy if you want a quick way to use the highlighter or eraser, but it's odd that they have two versions.  Mine is the larger capacity model, so it came with the upgraded version.The stylus serves two main functions.  You can use it to point to things and do highlighting, but the biggest function is to allow you to add handwritten notes.  Right now, those features are still pretty crude, but they work and I'm assuming they'll enhance this down the road with a software update.Handwritten notes in a book are pretty cool, and you can also use text based notes like older models.  I like the fact that I can create them on the fly, but it would be even better to literally overlay them right on the page.  I think it's probably a bit complicated to make this happen because the page itself is fluid because you could change the size of the fonts on the fly, so those markups would need change in position too.  Still, I think it's something that could come along in the future.You can see a list of all your notes in one place, or simply see the sentences or words they were anchored to when you created them.Another exciting feature is the ability to create NOTEBOOKS.  While this feature is a bit crude, I'm looking forward to future software updates to improve it.Among the ""missing features"" is the ability to rearrange pages or to simply add a page to anywhere other than the end.  So, if you have a 5 page notebook and you want to insert a page just before page 3, you can't do it, it's always added to the end and you can't move it to the middle if that's what you want.So, for now, I'm just tinkering with the notebook feature, but if I'm ever going to use it for something useful, I'll wait for future updates to make it possible to add pages in the middle or rearrange them.The bottom line is it's a big upgrade from the previous models and I'm looking forward to future feature improvements.",One person found this helpful

For many years I liked kindle. I have paperwhite, fire ,kindle on pc and tablets. But never had a same experience as reading actual printed book. Kindle scribe does it for me. I just love it. Screen size is just about a size of typical book, text is just as crisp as if it was printed. I never understood why people are writing notes or highlighting text in a book so I probably will never  use this feature, but using kindle as a notebook has a potential.So far I haven't found anything I don't like about it.",One person found this helpful

I have tried many other devices for handwriting meeting notes and the Scribe has been by far my favorite.I used an iPad Pro for a while but my biggest complaint is the battery life, it felt like no matter what I was charging pretty much every day. I also tried a ReMarkable 2, and BooX Note Air Plus 2. The remarkable was a bit too scratchy of a writing surface for me, and the BooX OS just didn‚Äôt do it for me running full Android.The scribe is the perfect Goldilocks of excellent writing, light, backlit, and amazing battery life (I have charged it twice in almost 4 months with daily use).The scribe absolutely has some room to grow on the software front, there‚Äôs no OCR or select and move, both of which are desperately needed to compete, and the Home Screen is a bit annoying as it‚Äôs about 90% kindle book store ads. Lastly there‚Äôs the case situation, Amazon chose to make their first party cases flip up like legal pads. It works fine, but the case in the remarkable 2 is such a perfectly thin, fold flat, book style case that I would spend 100$ without question on the same for the scribe.All and all my biggest hope is Amazon stays with it on this product line and the software updates because if so I‚Äôll be carrying a scribe for as long as they produce them.",
