"Apple 2021 10.2-inch iPad (Wi-Fi, 64GB) - Space Gray (9th Generation)",5.0,"Apple does it again, the best of Apple in a great price!","Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on March 26, 2023",Style: WiFi | Size: 64GB | Color: Silver,True,"I have had my iPad 9th Generation 64GB Wi-Fi since the end of November, 2022. It has been about 5 months. I upgraded from an iPad Air 2 32GB Wi-Fi (2014 model) that I had for almost 6 years! I have to say that there is a reason why Apple iPads are sold at such a premium price. That's because they provide valuable practical use for far longer than the vast majority of what is available in the tablet market.With that said the 2021 iPad 9th Generation is a base iPad with a limited amount of fancy features and a dated iPad design. Quite frankly, I actually use my iPad on the go and all of the iPads I have had go directly into an Otterbox Defender case. So I hardly notice the little aesthetics in design when my iPads area always in an Otterbox Defender case.I won't make this review long and will highlight the particular reason why I feel the need to write this review at all. I would say there's three top reasons why I believe the iPad 9th generation is excellent: 1. Good CPU performance/64GB base memory capacity, 2. Value pricing, and 3. Apple Pencil/Freeform.1. CPU performance is good with the A13 CPU from the iPhone 11. I am confident that I will be able to use this iPad for at least 4 more years, if not 5. I bought my iPad Air 2 (2014 model) in 2016 and it was supported with OS updates up until iPadOS 15, which is a total of 8 years. But the iPad Air 2 was among the longest supported iPads in Apple's tablet history. So it is not likely to be repeated. But I think that the iPad 9th generation should be supported for at least 6 years, 2021 to 2027. Plus, the 64GB base capacity is excellent for my basic use of the iPad.2. The pricing for the iPad 9th Generation 64GB retails at $329.99, but it is often for sale at $269.99. That's how much I purchased it for during Cyber Monday 2022. It has been on sale for as low as $249.99 at some other retailers as well. So overall, the pricing is very affordable for a device this capable with support for many years to come.3. I know that the Apple Pencil has been out for years, but I have only now tried it. It was not supported with my iPad Air 2 (2014 model) and I never gave it much thought as being useful to me. I always thought that the Apple Pencil was geared towards artists, which to some extent it is. I tried the Apple Pencil on my iPad 9th Generation about a month after getting mine. It was a revolutionary experience for me. I have been looking for a viable substitute for a whiteboard for the longest time. But there is not any real replacement for what you can do on a whiteboard. The Apple Pencil with FreeForm is the closest that I've come to the experience I get on a whiteboard. Although, I do still use a 4'x8' whiteboard for some brainstorming sessions, the Apple Pencil has afforded me to do some basic brainstorming in FreeForm. This is a massive benefit and I can only see Apple getting better with its FreeForm app. Not to mention app developers releasing new apps to take advantage of the Apple Pencil for brainstorming on a virtual whiteboard.Overall, I highly recommend the iPad 9th Generation.",102 people found this helpful

Right off the top it wouldn’t read the SD memory.. The software was setup to load everything personal into areas that are best kept private. Admittedly it usually takes time to learn and get use to new software but there was the problem with the SD memory. I returned it for an Apple 9th generation 10.2 tablet.. I couldn’t believe how easy it was to get started.. also I didn’t have to find and download an app that would transfer data from my iPhone..  Just easier that’s all. I’m very pleased with this device and would tell anyone to go for it.,22 people found this helpful

The A2606 has a longer battery life, but I didn't find it to be faster for what I use it for--basic email, apps and internet. Then sadly, the new iPad fell two feet from my lap to the floor and the screen shattered. Replacing the screen would be only $20 less than buying a whole new one so I'm not doing it.

"Apple 2021 10.2-inch iPad (Wi-Fi, 64GB) - Space Gray (9th Generation)",5.0,Great tablet,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on December 27, 2022",Style: WiFi | Size: 64GB | Color: Space Gray,True,"I use the iPAD 10.2"" exclusively for work - for teaching or content creation and I am extremely satisfied. If I travel anywhere (not for work) I take with me a small and very mobile iPAD mini on which I do everything outside of work.I bought this 10.2"" iPAD deliberately, after much deliberation, because I wanted the lightning connector, home button and wider bezels (it just suits me that way) and since it's the last iPAD in this configuration, I didn't hesitate to buy it. When they discounted it below 9000,- there wasn't much to decide.If I teach online I use this iPAD, where I draw in pre-prepared pictures and show the analysis procedure. Students really like this format and I find it easy to work this way too.I don't take the iPAD with me anywhere I have it more for work use at home. In fact, I find it too big to take it anywhere, the iPAD mini is good for that. But on the other hand, if one needs to go somewhere with a Mac, one can make a second monitor with this iPAD and work well again.Quite often I get the question whether it would be better to pay extra and buy an iPAD Air or Pro with Apple Pencil 2nd generation. Speaking honestly for myself, I see no reason to upgrade.If you are teaching and just need to ""draw, write and explain"", this is plenty sufficient. The 1st generation Apple Pencil is fine too. It needs extra charging, but I don't see the problem.",52 people found this helpful

"Apple 2021 10.2-inch iPad (Wi-Fi, 64GB) - Space Gray (9th Generation)",5.0,So Glad I Purchashed This!,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on October 19, 2021",Style: WiFi | Size: 64GB | Color: Space Gray,True," Upgraded from an  IPad 2018 6th Generation to the Ipad 2021 9th Generation. As you can see in the picture the new Ipad is on the left, it is slightly bigger than the 6th gen IPad, and a little heavier.Have used the 6th gen Ipad every day since I got it back in 2018 as a gift from a friend. And have really really enjoyed using it, never have had any problems with it. When I saw the new 9th gen was coming out I preordered wanting to upgrade, and was going to trade in the old 2018 ($150) but my wife wanted it so gave it to her instead. But she likes this one so much she is thinking of trading it in and getting a 9th gen as well.This Ipad has 64gigs of storage instead of the 32gigs I was used to. Which is greatly appreciated!. I spend a lot of time on the beach with my Ipad, reading, listening to music, and occasionally watching a program or two. I now have more storage for the music and videos.Now one of the main reasons I use the IPad is for my meetings for worship with the JW Library app and Zoom. JW Library has no lag. It's wonderful to use on this tablet. And I've used Zoom already a few times since I got this Ipad last week. And I can tell you the front facing camera upgrade is amazing, from the 1mp to 12mp you can notice a huge difference. And how the camera tracks you or you with your partner is a great feature we love!I don't know what type of rear-facing camera the 6th gen had compared to this one but there is a huge difference. I added a couple pictures I took of a sunset and sunrise on the beach, and a video. I am astonished at the quality and the beauty of the pics with this IPad. I have literally taken dozens of pics already and you can see for yourself the quality.Have also played around with some of the apps that came preloaded with it on OS 15 such as Imovies. Making a home movie, adding pictures, and effects, and music, is a breeze, the A13 processor has no problems whatsoever handling making the movies.I downloaded the new show The Lost Symbol to try out this tablet. And I can tell you it is a great viewing experience while winding down at the end of the day before going to bed. I am glad it still has the headphone jack.The True Tone technology on the screen leaves viewing the pictures taken and watching videos an amazing experience. This is a great technology that really shines through on this tablet.I am super satisfied with this tablet and highly recommend it for its easy of use, and tons of awesome features and quality for the price. If you're wanting to take awesome pictures or videos, use it for meetings and video conferences, and reading, such as using the JW Library app.A couple of other features more from the OS than the tablet itself I thought were worth mentioning. Having the Translate app on the home page. My wife is learning English and is always using this to translate messages she gets and sends all day, a great great feature! And the Background Sounds which can be activated and put on the control center through Accessibility and Audio Visual, and Background sounds. My wife turns this on every night to help her get to sleep.10/10!",507 people found this helpful

I need it to have a 3.5mm audio jack, because I do a lot of audio/visual work that requires connecting to audio equipment.  I like the screen size.  The display is beautiful and crisp.  I have not noticed any lagging, so to date the performance has been perfect.  I have had no issues with battery life.  I like the usability of the Lightning connector, and since all I need it for is charging, its data speed and equipment compatibility limitations are not an issue for me.  It has 4 times the amount of storage as my old iPad (and I'd never run low on storage with the old one), so I don't envision storage capacity ever being an issue.

I actually believe the 8th gen got at least 45mins possibly 1 hour more per charge when using airplane mode + Wi-Fi doing the same stuff/same settings. The safari homepage for some reason does not sync my most frequently visited websites/nor can I view webpages on iPad that I visit/open on my iPhone, or receive text messages from iPhone on my iPads iMessage (it used to work, now does not & I’ve tried everything)… all these things just worked flawlessly on iPad 8th gen!

It is NOT refurbed or an exchange. It is never opened and shrink wrapped by Apple. (See my photos.) The reason it is so much cheaper than the other 2021 iPads is the 64gb storage. But with iCloud so ridiculously cheap for cloud storage, I just cannot see this 64gb as not getting the job done. I myself was curious about this low price buying me a refurb/exchange, but that is simply not the case here. I do, however, recommend you not go with 32gb. I believe even with an iCloud account, you will be sorry you didn’t go 64gb.And the ease of setting this up cannot be understated. I simply sat my iPhone 13 Pro Max next to it and all relevant files and Wi-Fi passwords were transferred over with no input from me. It looked to me that it will do that with Android and most laptops also, though I did not test that out. All photos also came over, and the ones I took after that transfer, I simply Air-Dropped them into this iPad. All in all, this is as simple as it gets for transferring files and photos. Apple has this stuff down to a science, believe me.This screen is incredible. If you are looking at a pre-Retina screen, you will be amazed at this 2021 version. This thing is very fast, the on screen keyboard is fast, accurate and very concise. Dealing with apps is easy, and Apple doesn’t load you down with bloat you’ll never use. It is claimed this has about 12 hours on a charge; what I’ve seen thus far leads me to believe that is accurate.All in all, I am extremely pleased with this purchase. You can’t always say you got what you paid for. But I can definitely say that with this. This is the entry level 2021 9th generation iPad, and it is exactly what I need.

Every device we own from this brand, gets used to its fullest potential or passed to someone in the family when we upgrade.  If we discover my son needs 256gb well, this one will probably replace another even older 6th gen someone in the fam is still using!  That one still works great too though!

I had purchased the iPad Pro as a refurb 2 - 3 years ago, I am not in a poaition to repair it myself, and it doesn’t seem practical to pay for a repair.Besides the swelling battery, the main reason I replaced the Gen 1 iPad Pro was to get more CPU and more storage.This A13 hexcore CPU is noticeably more powerful then the two core A9X CPU Of the GEN 1 Pro,  Apps and games that would stutter and freeze run smoothly now.Even though this is a base iPad, it feels as good or better than the earlier iPad Pro in almost every way, except the sound.  The 4 speaker sound system of the iPad. Pro provides a richer sound than this base iPad.I paid $425 with Apple Prime for this base 256GB iPad.  Better sound is available on iPadAir and iPad Pro, but they cost $850 and $950 respectively.  I can live with the sound of this iPad knowing I saved $400 - $500.I can buy a blue tooth speaker for less than $50 if I find I need better sound.  Or I can just cast my media to my TV if I want better sound.I am pleased with this purchase.  After owning several iPads, this one has the lowest cost while still being the most capable iPad I have owned.  This is the first time that I feel like I received good value for the miney spent.= = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = =",39 people found this helpful

I have received my emails, seen my wonderful photos from my iphone etc.  Everything on my iphone was immediately copied to my new tablet almost miraculously.  The box it came in was pristine, and beautiful.  So far I have no complaints, and have not had it long enough to know about the battery life.  I think it is beautiful and am looking forward to watching Netflix on it etc.  As I was told, it is just like a BIG IPHONE, except that I did not get cellular service.

If you're used to working on a laptop or desktop, such as an iMac, an iPad will seem like a toy. One that can be really frustrating, baroque, limited & time-consuming. On the other hand, if you want something for note-taking, this would be excellent along with an iPencil. It has a native notes app, plus there are many note-taking apps to add, and really good ones like Notability and Good Notes. Also fine for watching movies or playing around. Beyond that ... well, I wish I'd gotten another iMac instead. As for reading, I have an 3-year-old Amazon tablet that was super affordable on sale, and I like reading on it better than I do reading on an iPad. (Kindle app seems better on that too, and I can see my collections well—they are sized way larger.) IPad really is A PAD as far as I'm concerned, and excellent for that, but forget beyond that.If I change my mind in the future, I'll revise this review.",One person found this helpful
"Apple 2021 10.2-inch iPad (Wi-Fi, 64GB) - Space Gray (9th Generation)",3.0,Uninspiring IPAD with lots of issues,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on December 14, 2022",Style: WiFi | Size: 64GB | Color: Space Gray,True,"I bought this IPAD with high expectations, however, it has done nothing but disappointed.  First, all of Apple's requirements to make an Apple ID, password, passcode, is extremely dragged out.  The process to set up the tablet is extremely long and having to remember all the passwords are difficult.  Second, a lot of the screen is actually blacked out on the side.  I wanted to see the whole screen while watching movies and videos, not parts of it.  Third, some parts of the IPAD is unresponsive.  I had to click multiple times in order for the tablet to register what I was trying to do.  Fourth, the fingerprint requirement is a pain.  When my son wants to download an app for gaming, I have to go over and have it take my fingerprint.  An annoying and unnecessary step.  Fifth, storage is horrible when you download regular games.  I suggest buying the more storage option.  Sixth, the battery is terrible.  I was expecting the battery to rival Samsung Tablets, however, that was not the case.  The IPAD dies quickly even when on low power mode.  Not what I was expecting when I spent hundreds on a tablet.  Onto a more positive note, I do believe that the built quality is up to standard and it was nice that Apple included the charging brick and cables.Pros:1. Built quality is good2. Accessories (charging brick and cable) were includedCons:1. Long set up times2. Very large black bars on the side3. Some spots were unresponsive unless repeatedly tapped on4. Fingerprint system is a hassle5. Storage for apps is horrible6. VERY VERY short battery life!",7 people found this helpful

From what I can tell, I simply received a returned unit. The item was described as having multiple cosmetic defects, however, all I saw was a few small scratches on the Apple logo which doesn't bother me. I was able to buy Apple Care for this iPad after receiving it, which means it was less than 90 days old when it got to me. Essentially I got a brand new iPad for $52 off.As far as the device its self, especially at $300 for the 64GB model, I think the standard iPad can be a great deal depending on your use case. In my case I wanted something to watch videos on, do school work, and edit videos. The iPad can handle all that for me, and is cheaper than a decent laptop.There are a couple things I find funny about the base model iPad. It's a 2021 device, but yet it lacks a 5G cellular option. I wouldn't consider this a big deal since I would just tether off my phone if I needed to, but it is worth noting since this is a 2021 device. It also doesn't feature NFC. Lastly, there is no Face ID, but touch ID is fine in all reality.I only got the 256GB because of the lower price used and I plan to do RAW photo editing on this device, so I would prefer to have more local storage. The 64GB would be fine for someone who uses the device mainly for streaming, and at $300, I think is a great price.",18 people found this helpful

Well this is the perfect thing for you, the screen is just the right size and very crisp and clear(maybe better then my iPhone X), the responsiveness is excellent, and all of the streaming sites work with this perfectly. On top of that, my AirPods automatically switch between this and my phone, so I don’t have to worry about messing with the settings every time. However, the camera is only OK. And it feels very delicate, so I would pick up a case and get AppleCare+. The battery isn’t the best either, but should be enough to get through the day. Overall I definitely recommend this, especially for the price.",46 people found this helpful

They were just going to be used for basic browsing and book-reading, and I thought a $150 tablet would work -- and Apple doesn't offer one at that price range.  Boy was I wrong:  really crummy screens and unbelievably slow.  And the software and interface were just awkward.So I bit the bullet and upgraded to these.  Yes, the price was a little over double as much.  But they are easily 10 times more useful.  The screen alone was worth the extra price:  the Android tablets were like 1080p, with big, noticeable pixels and very poor sharpness and color range.  The iPads are *beautiful*, and much easier on the eyes.The Android tablets were unbelievably slow:  5-10 seconds for an app to open, and 1-2 seconds to respond to button presses.  It was a nightmare.  The iPads are fast and responsive.And the iPadOS software is *way* better, especially on the Family Sharing interface and features.In the end, they may have cost twice as much, but I'm confident that they will not only be usable for a much longer time, but that they are much more *useful* during that time as well.",6 people found this helpful

Should you get this one as your first one? Probably. It does 90%+ of what the pro models do. After a year of using it, if you find you need that extra power from a better model-- upgrade. Who will love this ipad? Kids, social media users, people who watch a lot of videos, listen to music or podcasts, hobbyist creative types. The majority of users. Who needs a more expensive model? Pro photographers, image editors, video editors, 3D cad designers, VR and AR creators, youtube content creators.

I bought it together with the 1st generation apple pencil with the idea of replacing all my paper notebooks and taking notes at college with it and I would say that the experience has been flawless. Its not the best ipad available, I know that the Ipad air is sexier, has a bigger screen and supports the 2nd generation pencil but this ipad is just extraordinary for any student. Besides, my experience with the 1st apple pencil is incredible, there is practically no delay while writing, the screen size is excellent for taking notes and the palm rejection technology allows me to take notes fastly. The only downside is that there is a gap between the glass and the screen and you can see it while writing but its not a real issue, you get used to it. To conclude, if money is not a problem for you and you are a student willing to replace all your paper notebooks I recommend you to get the ipad air + 2nd generation combo but if you dont have 700$ to get it you wont regret buying the iPad 9th and not getting the better one.",107 people found this helpful

The iPad was packaged well and it shipped quickly and arrived when promised. I would have given the iPad and seller 5 stars but is only getting 2 stars because  whoever was responsible for checking this over before shipping it out had the screen brightness as low as possible so I had to really strain my eyes to get through a very lengthy set up process that I could barely see due to how dark the screen was before I could get into the iPad to change the brightness settings. This resulted in sore eyes and a great deal of frustration that was absolutely unnecessary if only the seller would have used some courtesy and common sense before shipping out this device.

I was hesitant but after talking to people that own iPads and reading reviews, it made sense to pay the price for a high quality tablet that will last for many, many years rather than continue to buy Fire tablets that only last one year and so many apps, like Roblox will not fully work on.I am so pleased with my decision! The battery life is exceptional, the screen/image quality is a million times better than the Fire tablet, plus my child can play their favorite games without glitching or lagging and they can also access their online speech therapy resources, which we couldn’t do on the Fire.I wish I would’ve went with the iPad years ago!",17 people found this helpful

After never owning an ipad in my life to getting this one as a first, I’m amazed! The reviews for this thing were off the charts. For it only being $329 you really get a powerhouse of a machine for the price tag. It can handle multi-tasking very very easily. The battery seems to never drain as well. The brightness of the screen is perfect for just chilling around the house which is what I’m using it for. Grabbed a nice tempered glass screen protector and a case with a prop-up on the back of it and it does the job. The only thing I wish they did differently was get rid of the notches at the top and bottom of the screen. For $329 I can’t complain too much!

The sound is not half as good. Honestly, this is a big deficiency. We played the same song on both at the same time to compare. The screen is good but not as rich, vivid, beautiful and dazzling as our Samsung.  Samsung wins on camera too. Battery life is good, but again, not nearly as good as the Samsung. The processor speed is good, and this is the only plus in comparison. I think we're paying for Apple name and reputation now. The product seems secondary. It is no longer top of the heap in direct comparison.  Sorry, Apple, you're playing catch up now.  It hurts me to state that.",7 people found this helpful

I ordered an iPad thinking it was from the apple store but it’s sold by Amazon BTW. The newer version just came out so I’m attempting to return it since I bought the new one direct from Apple. First off, UPS must pick it up from your home and provide the tracking label then. There is no way to return the item direct to a UPS store so prepare to sit home waiting for a pickup. I learned this by speaking with Amazon customer service which is the most frustrating experience ever!! Have you ever called them? Good luck understanding them!!  I’m hoping UPS calls before the pickup since I couldn’t understand the woman. I order a lot on Amazon but never again with big items! Ugh",5 people found this helpful

Several things I don't like about the Ipad.  It constantly askes for your fingerprint or passcode every time you attempt to download an app.  If you don't have other Apple products, you have to set up your Apple account, two more passwords, one for your tablet, one for your Apple account and since it's not powered by Android which uses Google to store passwords, you need to locate your saved passwords from Google and retype them.  I also don't like the interface.  I have to learn everything all over again.  It's a hassle.  I'll stick with Android next time.  Also I had to buy a separate charger that had a USB connection because I needed to reset the Ipad to factory settings when I forgot what my passcode was after not using the Ipad for a month.",10 people found this helpful

Maybe if I had no other Apple items and was completely new to Apple it may have worked however; if you currently own Apple products, it is a nightmare!  Called Apple Service for help and they too, couldn't make the product work???  Can only surmise that Apple products have become just like Microsoft, very difficult to setup and full of bugs and glitches.  A REAL HEADACHE for the average consumer to buy and use.  I am returning this piece of junk and will use our old iPad until we no longer can.  Then will look at alternatives to Apple as they are no longer the company I once really liked.  Steve Jobs was the secret to Apple's success.  Tim Cook has destroyed Apple and it is clearly apparent if you buy any of their newer products.  They are all much more difficult to use and way overpriced.",28 people found this helpful

(She asked for it). I never saw it work. She brought it to me later in the day to show me it was locked (disabled).  I hate Apple products, but I downloaded and installed iTunes on my Windows PC in an attempt to rescue this device from its disabled state. iTunes choked my PC, then it choked itself. Finally got it working, got logged into iTunes, and began an iPad restore. After an hour, I got an error saying it was unable to restore the device. Tried it again. No joy. Called Apple support and they had me repeat the same steps. I told them it wasn't going to work, but they insisted. They told me let the restore run again, and they would call me back in 30 minutes. That was 2 days ago. Haven't heard back from them. The restore process failed (as expected). Now the device is stuck in restore mode. I have repeatedly tried all the google remedies to free it from restore mode, but none of them work. Its still in restore mode, and I can't even power the damn thing off. What a nightmare!!! I've wasted nearly 2 days following the instructions on this time vampire, and it went from bad to worse!",48 people found this helpful

I'm fairly impressed.,"Reviewed in the United States on November 26, 2022",Style: WiFi | Size: 64GB | Color: Space Gray,False,"Up until a couple weeks ago, I'd only used PC's and my phone has always been Android based. My sister won an Ipad 9 and having no real use for it, gave it to me. My initial impressions have been mostly positive. While I mostly expected it to be more of a toy, I have found some good uses for it. It's great for displaying PDF files such as reference books that my Kindle just wouldn't handle well. It's got a lot more screen for writing on than my phone. Obviously it's better for watching video content on than my phone while in bed. Here are some observations:There are some very good apps. Some of them that have a paid premium version are good enough you might not need to upgrade for some time. That's balanced by the cost of apps you do purchase being higher than what you might be used to on a phone. They tend to do a lot more though.I don't have an Apple Pencil and don't need one. For basic sketching and writing notes, I'm happy to have a non-connected one that offers tilt and a much longer battery life.Mine came with a typical sized bluetooth keyboard. I used it twice and then put it in a drawer to collect dust. I'd seriously rather type on the display keyboard than bother with that ridiculous thing. If you must have a keyboard, get a regular PC one with mechanical keys that's compatible. You might as well get a full size mouse as well at that point. Touch pads suck.My biggest gripe is how one has to transfer files from the PC to the Ipad. All my other devices can just plug in via USB cable and I'm good to go. With the Ipad, I had to install Itunes to do it. You can only send to specific apps, not to a created folder. Using an app designed for music files (the one thing I have no interest in using the Ipad for) to do this task is a little clunky, but ultimately did work.Ultimately, I'm incredibly impressed at how much useful computing power is in a device this thin and at a price this low. My Kindle cost more than the current selling price of one of these. Heck, a full Raspberry Pi 4 kit is more expensive at this point. I'm seriously considering getting another one to put in a magnetic backed case to stick on the fridge for a calendar, whiteboard, grocery list maker, recipe box, etc.",

The one negative is my fault and not the ipad's.  I opted for wi-fi only  because we already have 2 iphones.  One of the reasons for getting the ipad was to be able to watch movies on a larger screen while eating dinner or in bed. So, the second day after setting up the ipad, what happens? Our internet goes out.  Couldn't use the ipad for 3 days until it was fixed.  If I had chosen cellular I would have been able to use it. But, very honestly, I was too cheap to spend the additional money for the ipad itself in addition to the monthly charges because I thought the iphones were enough. Believe it when I say that for those 3 days I was really annoyed and could have kicked myself for not springing for the cellular. But now that internet is up and running beautifully, I'm happy that I don't have the expense of the cellular service. Of course if it goes out again I'm sure I'll be just as annoyed. But until then  -this is  a beautiful, easy to set up and use device.",

"Apple 2021 10.2-inch iPad (Wi-Fi, 64GB) - Space Gray (9th Generation)",5.0,2021 10.2 is a substantial upgrade over 2020 version at same price,"Reviewed in the United States on October 1, 2021",Style: WiFi | Size: 64GB | Color: Silver,False,"The 2020 iPad 10.2, which I own, was widely reviewed as the best iPad for most people. It blows away tablets from all other manufacturers, and will do most of what the more expensive iPads will do, albeit not as quickly and not as attractively. It's a great, excellent bang-for-the buck tablet for media consumption and light creative work (email, short documents). If you add a bluetooth keyboard, which I do, you can quickly bang out long emails and longer documents. It's a very versatile and portable device with an all-day battery.That said, I'm upgrading to the 2021 model, which is a substantial upgrade over 2020 version at same price. Contrary to the statement by another reviewer, the improvement to the front-facing camera is a big deal. The resolution is markedly better, which is good for FaceTime calls, the Center Stage feature, which isn't available even on the iPad Air, is an upgrade for video, and the TrueTone display is more satisfying to many (I like it).Moreover, the base memory for the 2021 model is, at 64 gb, twice that of the 2020 model which was pretty tight although usable at 32 gb. I bumped up against that limit a couple of times, so I love getting double the memory.The 2021 model has a moderately faster CPU chip and substantially faster GPU (graphic) function, neither of which matter at this point for my use.I probably would have hung onto the 2020 model which is adequate to most of my tasks, despite the relatively low memory. But Apple and a blue Big Box store offer pretty good trade-ins on the 2020. By taking advantage of price matching and trade-in of the 2020, I'm able to get the 202110.2 for $80. It's well worth $80 to me for the additional storage and the greatly improved front facing camera. You might be able to sell a 2020 for more than I got on the trade-in, but I didn't explore that.In brief, the 2021 10.2 inch iPad should be on your short list for tablets--check out the reviews. And even if you have a recent model low end iPad like me, it could be worth your while to upgrade.",11 people found this helpful

I am not sure why some people are giving it 3 star reviews.  This is the lowest priced iPad model you can buy and it now has a processor that really makes gaming and other things much faster.What is better than last years model (8th Gen)This 9th Gen iPad now has a 12MP Front Facing Ultra Wide camera with 2x zoom and the new ""Center Stage"" feature. This is great for video calls as it tracks your movement and keeps you in the center of the frame. Now compared to the 1.2MP Camera on last years version!The 9th Gen also has a faster processor running the neural processor system. I guess we will learn more about what that can do as more apps come out.You can now get double the  memory for the same price as last year.  If you don't mess with a lot of photos then the 64GB version should be good for you.  I tend to create a lot of videos and photos so I opted for the 256GB version.The things that remain the same are the battery life and the screen resolution and quality.  I am still glad they kept the finger print reader and the lightning port.  I got a lot of stuff that is made for that lightning port.Overall I am very happy with my purchase.

Each new iteration of the iPad is significantly worse than the last, with a frustrating lack of attention to basic problems that keep the OS in the dark ages. How do you screw up an on off button? Well in this case you make sure it won’t turn on when you press the on button.  Instead you have to hold it down for an indeterminate amount of time, and to turn it off you don’t just press the off button, you have to also press one of the volume buttons. Stupid. Even more frustrating, if your iPad is off (because presumably your battery is low) and you plug it in the power will just come on automatically and continue to drain your battery. Having your iPad plugged in while on will result in the need to keep it plugged in for a significant amount of time before it will become charged, if at all.  This is absolutely ridiculous and makes it almost impossible to keep a full charge on the device. The battery itself drains extremely quickly even when you turn off all of the obnoxious apple options, continuously interacting with the Internet, and Siri.  Unlike the OS for iPhone, there is no option to go into a low power mode. Moving apps on the home screen and organizing your contact is still extremely frustrating. Because they’ve gotten rid of the single button you cannot just simply return to the home screen, you were continuously trying to swipe up most of the time to no affect. To close apps is even worse you have to attempt multiple times to swipe up and hope that the various apps appear in front of you so that you can swipe yet again to turn them off. Of course this is all in an attempt to save battery life because the battery is so poor.  And because they’ve got rid of the central button and you were continuously swiping on everything your screen becomes disgustingly filled with fingerprints, grime, and dirt almost instantly.  Using a stylus is not any better as they don’t seem to have the technology right to make this an easy solution to the problem of a poorly designed tablet.  Of course the lack of a headphone jack is it an appalling omission as Apple has never been serious about quality Bluetooth and their headphones have been the most consistently avoided tech the last 20 years .  I seriously question whether anybody who designed this device has ever actually used it in a day today environment, as the developers are obviously ignorant of these obvious problems.  Apple seems to have no desire to make things better, only to clutter devices with features that become an onerous burden rather than solving problems for the user. This will definitely be my last iPad.",36 people found this helpful

"Apple 2021 10.2-inch iPad (Wi-Fi, 64GB) - Space Gray (9th Generation)",5.0,Great every day tablet at a great price point.,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on September 28, 2021",Style: WiFi | Size: 64GB | Color: Silver,False,"iPad is my go to device, other than my work computer. I use it for everything. From watching TV/Movies, to sketching to reading magazines, and everything else.Background: I currently own 4 iPads (12.9 inch iPad Pro 2015, 12.9 inch iPad Pro 2021, iPad 2018, and now 2021 iPad 10.2)  and have owned several others before, and a Surface Pro, a recent Surface Book, and 2 Kindle Fire tablets so I can say with confidence I am a tablet user. :-) Tablets are how I consume my content and though I've given other devices a chance I keep coming back to iPads due to the intuitive interface and not having to worry about the device,  and just enjoy my content.Why I like this iPad 10.2 inch:Why did I get this one despite owning a 2021 iPad Pro 12.9 inch?This size of iPad is at the right price point and it has the right features, to make it my everywhere in the home, backyard, and travel companion. This is the one I don't have to worry about losing vs. my 2021 iPad Pro 1 TB that was just under $2K. The size makes it super convenient to carry around to read in a park or on the plane, do a quick FaceTime call while reading a recipe off it in the kitchen (the FT appears in a little window) and cooking. I love sketching on my iPad, and this 10.2 iPad though smaller than iPad Pro 12.9, feels more like a notebook, while the iPad Pro 12.9 inch is a magazine size (see photos for comparison of 2021 iPad Pro 12.9 with this iPad) and can be heavy to hold with one hand, I need to prop it up while sketching. I find the new iPad even more responsive to the Apple pencil, it's a joy to sketch on these or take quick notes during meetings, that then convert to text if I want. Though I LOVE my iPad Pro this one gets a lot of use due to the size and portability.I like keeping this one on my recliner arm to browse around when I am next to the TV to find out more about the program I'm watching, or to read a book in bed without worrying about dropping it on my face. The iPad Pro needs to be propped up, and once almost broke my nose when I got sleepy and it fell on my face! I also love looking at my photos that I take on the iPhone on my iPad as it's more immersive and so much easier to show someone than squinting at the phone. I usually keep the photos in iCloud due to the limit on storage on the device, and the iPad can just download them when I am viewing them. I also do craft work, and watching YouTube instruction videos and reading my crochet patterns is great on this size, it's just ready on the side of my sofa. I also drop it countless times (with case on) as it's sitting on the sofa arm, something I worry more about with the iPad Pro as it's bigger. I also like that this is the one device that still has a headphone jack, I own some sets of high end earbuds that use the traditional jack and it's great to be able to use them with it as the bluetooth buds need to be charged and sometimes I just want things to be simpler.The 12 MP Front Camera on this 2021 version is great as FaceTime is so much clearer than my older version, I had to switch to my phone to FaceTime earlier due to the blurry video, but now I can do it right from the iPad. iOS 15 has all new features like Center Stage where the camera moves with the participant in a call, and that makes it so useful. I typically don't use a keyboard on my 10.2 iPad as I rarely type on it. I prefer doing that on my iPad Pro, but I've tried this size with Belkin and Logitech keyboards and they worked really well. Although I could fold them back, I just didn't like the added weight as I did not use the keyboard often enough and once you put on that keyboard cover the advantages of a light tablet go away.Overall, I would not really recommend upgrading if you have a recent iPad, but if you want to give your older iPad to a kid or your mom and get this one, go for it. However, I do recommend getting an iPad over other tablets. iOS 15 has unlocked even more features on it and it's super intuitive. It makes me happy to have a device where I can sketch at a moments notice, watch a show, or a craft video, edit my docs, write down my ""bright"" ideas with Apple pencil and have them convert to text, talk to my friends on video and oh yes, also listen to music, although I do that more on my phone. And it's the right size to carry in my purse, and I don't have to panic about dropping it or even losing it. Go ahead, you deserve it.","1,232 people found this helpful"

"Apple 2021 10.2-inch iPad (Wi-Fi, 64GB) - Space Gray (9th Generation)",4.0,"Minor upgrade from last year's version, least expensive iPad available","Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on September 24, 2021",Style: WiFi | Size: 64GB | Color: Space Gray,False,"This 9th Gen iPad (2021) only got a few upgrades over the previous version, but is still the least expensive iPad option.Upgrades over 2020 version:-A13 Bionic Chip:  Previous version had A12 chip-Storage:  Now has either 64GB or 256GB, previous version was 32GB or 128GB-Selfie Camera:  Now has 12MP ultrawide front camera, previous version was 1.2MP standard front camera-Center Stage:  Front camera follows you to keep you centered in the frame, not available in previous version-True Tone:  Adjusts color temperature to match environment, not available in previous versionSo, of these features, the most noticeable upgrade is probably the improved front-facing camera.  This makes for better looking video calls and selfie photos, and the Center Stage camera tracking feature might be useful if you move around on video calls.  The A13 chip is supposed to be up to 20% faster also, although I haven't really noticed that much of a difference so far.Besides those upgrades I listed, everything else is almost exactly the same as the 2020 version of the regular iPad.  Same exact build, screen resolution, brightness, rear camera, speakers, battery, lightning charger port, and only support for Gen 1 Pencil (NOT Gen 2 Pencil).  There is no gold color available this year either.So to summarize, this 9th generation iPad is really just slightly faster, with more storage and a better front facing camera.  The True Tone feature isn't that noticeable to me really, and since the screen brightness wasn't upgraded, it still seems a bit dim at 500nits when you are outside on a bright day.Having said that, this is still the least expensive option for an iPad.  Apple is discontinuing the previous generation version from last year, so if you are looking for the cheapest iPad, this will be the one for the next 12 months or so.  At this price it is not at all a bad deal, I just wish it supported the 2nd Gen Apple Pencil, or at least had a USB-C port like the new Mini.  For now, I would not recommend upgrading from last years regular iPad, unless you absolutely need the better front camera.",782 people found this helpful

"Apple 2021 10.2-inch iPad (Wi-Fi, 64GB) - Space Gray (9th Generation)",5.0,I'm an Android Guy - But the iPad Seems Like the Best Value,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on October 28, 2022",Style: WiFi | Size: 64GB | Color: Space Gray,True,"All of my devices are Android-based, including my phone, watch, and super old first tablet (Asus Transformer Prime). We bought two of the Kindle Fire HD Kids edition tablets and they seem to be junk to me, to be blunt. Both have had major issues within two years of ownership. One tablet bricked a high-quality microSD card, and both somewhat regularly will tell me to reinsert the microSD card (which we never take out). They are extremely laggy & don't support many PC/video games, the battery life is just so-so, and they're not reliable. I was OK purchasing tablets for my kids that would be durable (they come in excellent cases), have easy-to-use parental controls (which work great), lower-quality screens, and limited capability. However, I cannot accept their poor reliability. With all of that said, it left me looking for a tablet for my son to play Minecraft, Roblox, and other games that require higher processing power. I decided that I would rather pay a little more for something that has higher quality and capability. I have many family members who have been purchasing Apple products for a long time who have a spectrum of reviews. Not all are in love with their Apple products (especially the iPhone), but they have always spoken highly of the iPad. So, even though Apple is relatively unimpressive to me, and I can't stand many of the social gimmicks that are great...only if you have an Apple product, I decided that of all the available tablets as of Sep-2022, this tablet was the best option. I was also to nab it at a price of $280. So far, I am absolutely thrilled with the tablet. It performs exemplary. I would highly recommend this to anyone looking for a reliable tablet that has good processing performance, good battery life, and all-around good capabilities. The only drawbacks are the ""control/monopolization"" of it being an Apple product and no expandable physical storage (i.e. microSD card slot). But I knew those drawbacks going into it. I am certainly excited to see the Pixel tablet when it drops as that will be a strong consideration to replace the second Kindle Fire. However, I certainly recommend this iPad to anyone looking for an all-around great tablet.",27 people found this helpful

It has a great screen, battery life, available accessories, and iOS ecosystem. It can do iMessage, Facetime, and Airplay. Works well to complement your iPhone, Mac, and AirPods. It's not as great as the Air, Pro, or 2022 iPad but it's a fraction of the cost. Those devices have become too expensive whereas this iPad does all the basics at a very affordable price. I'd pick up this device for myself and as a gift still in 2022 and likely 2023.",

I won't buy an Off brand ever again.  I did see a few reviews that were 1 star and I'm hoping this tablet doesn't have a problem like some of the other reviews because its for my daughter.  I do however have the whole home insurance coverage via Verizon so it covers any electronic device that connect via wifi.  So worse case this does not have an issue.  I do k kw there were many many many shortcuts nationwide for products made in 2021 due to the PLANDEMIC.  Everything was twice the price half the quality.  Hopefully this one will stay working g but if not Apple will fix it or I'll just use out whole home replacement insurance,One person found this helpful

What really me was when I learned that all the data and apps from my iPhone 11 could be transferred to the iPad by following easy to understand instructions. I did that and within about 15 minutes, everything from the iPhone jumped over to new iPad. How cool is that?I’ve owned earlier iPad versions but this one leaves those in the dust. It’s well worth the update for only about $300 all in.  You can buy more than the 64G storage but that’s plenty for me. I would recommend buying a cover ( my old cover from an earlier iPad didn’t work..not the right size). Why a cover for around $10? This iPad is as slippery as a fish, easily dropped so why chance it?  All in all, a terrific product and bargain from the troops at Apple. Well done techies.",49 people found this helpful

I had to purchase an Ipad in order to take a digital art course that requires Procreate and an Apple pencil (for hand drawing, etc.).  I selected this item because it was a slightly older model and the best price I could find.  I purchased an Apple pencil separately.  The item was received and is as described by the seller.I use if for several hours or more at a time.  The battery does tend to drain after two or more drawing sessions, depending on how long I work, but I can't say that it's a quick drain.  I can also use it while it's plugged in, which is also a plus.My only concern is that the Apple pencil that's appropriate to/works with this Ipad model doesn't always respond as well as it should, but I don't know if it's the pencil or the Ipad.So far, I am satisfied with this item.

"Apple 2021 10.2-inch iPad (Wi-Fi, 64GB) - Space Gray (9th Generation)",5.0,Best decision I’ve made in a while,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on October 17, 2022",Style: WiFi | Size: 64GB | Color: Space Gray,True,"My MacBook Pro crashed last week, totally unsalvageble.  It was seven years old and hadn’t been getting any updates from apple for a long time.  When I checked to see how long I’d had my iPad and iPhone, I kind of freaked out because they too are in the seven year range.So I reviewed my needs and realized that I hardly ever used my MacBook and didn’t really need to plunk down 2100 for a new one.  Then I thought about my iPad Air with Wi-Fi and cellular and wondered if I needed all that.  Turns out I didn’t.  I researched the best iPads from several reputable websites and they all recommended the apple 9th generation iPad.  For my own personal needs, I decided to ditch the cellular and just go with Wi-Fi.  After all, I have a cell phone.  This saves me from paying a twenty dollar monthly data plan and the one time output of several hundred more for the cellular capable iPad.I ordered a new iPhone from apple so now I’m updated and saving a huge amount of money.This iPad was a breeze to set up.  I just followed the online steps.  It transferred all of my data without a glitch.I’m 71 and semi tech savvy.  I also am trying to save money but still have all the conveniences.Hopefully this review will help guide others on the fence.",110 people found this helpful

Having all my notes on me in one place is the most convenient thing. Every time I threw away a notebook with a whole semester’s work inside it, a little part of me died inside. I also have a loooooooooot of school ahead of me, and so it will be really cool to have notes I wrote down three years ago just a few taps away.It is the ‘smaller’ version, but I am a small person. I can still do the side by side thing (having the IPad split with the textbook on left side, and your note taking app on the right side), but for others it may be too small. The ease of use of the Apple Pencil and the notability app blow my mind. I literally look forward to taking notes in class on my IPad. It is is seamless- highlighting and changing colors, dragging in images from textbooks… that is so freakin cool.So this is truly wonderful. Worth it worth it worth it.

Honestly, while I could have gotten a different brand that cost less, I was impressed that my tablet had lasted so long. The battery had started to noticeably drain faster but that was the only problem I was having with it. After seeing how well Apple makes their products, I decided to stick with them when making my purchase. So far, the iPad 9 is performing well for me. I enjoy the screen resolution/response and it's bigger than my previous tablet. I mostly watch YouTube, check emails, and use it for things that my phone's screen is too small for. But, I've been wanting to get started with digital drawing and I feel that this tablet will be enough for me to get my feet wet. Maybe I can get another 8 years before upgrading again.",60 people found this helpful

I downloaded Cloud Library and can now check books out with ease from my local library. It is handy for reading and sending e-mails. I discovered a neat feature of a magnifier. I know full well that this is only the first of many cool and unexpected features I will discover. And the battery life! It lasts all day and only discharges a little. This is a very good purchase. Apple leads the tablet Markey by light years!",4 people found this helpful
