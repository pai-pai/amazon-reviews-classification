Nintendo USB Switch Pro Controller,5.0,Game-Changing Controller,"Reviewed in the United States on April 13, 2023",Color: Black | Edition: Single,True,"I recently purchased the Nintendo USB Switch Pro Controller, and it has completely changed my gaming experience. As someone who loves playing games on the Nintendo Switch, I've always been a fan of the Joy-Con controllers that come with the console, but I found them to be a bit too small and cramped for extended gaming sessions. That's where the Switch Pro Controller comes in.The first thing I noticed about the controller was how comfortable it is to hold. The grip is smooth and ergonomic, and the buttons are placed in a way that makes them easy to access without feeling like you're reaching too far. The controller also has a good weight to it, making it feel substantial in your hands without being too heavy.One of the standout features of the Switch Pro Controller is its battery life. I've used it for hours on end without needing to charge it, which is a huge improvement over the Joy-Con controllers. And when it does need to be charged, it only takes a couple of hours to get back to full power.The controller is also incredibly responsive, with no noticeable input lag. The buttons and joysticks have a great feel to them, and I've found that it's made a big difference in my gameplay. I'm able to be more precise with my movements and actions, which has helped me improve in games where accuracy is key.Overall, I would highly recommend the Nintendo USB Switch Pro Controller to anyone who spends a lot of time gaming on the Switch. It's a game-changer that will improve your experience and make your gaming sessions more comfortable and enjoyable.",2 people found this helpful

Honestly, if you just play on your switch a lot you should probably get it. I've heard drift on the switch's base joycons is a big problem. I've not had to deal with it personally because I've been using this controller. I bought it April 2021. 2yrs ago pretty much and it hasn't had any drifting issues and can last several hours before needing to be charged. I've played super smash bros, pokemon unite, hyrule warriors - just to name some of the more click intensive games on my list. Comfortable to use too, or at least for me it's comfortable. Felt like a natural transition from using the joycons in that lil weird controller combo that comes with the switch to this controller now.",11 people found this helpful

Nintendo USB Switch Pro Controller,5.0,The best controller on the market right now,"Reviewed in the United States on January 31, 2019",Color: Black | Edition: Single,True,"I have large hands, and I find that most controllers are smaller than I'd like (many are much smaller than I'd like). It's been years since I used a controller that I thought was large enough to sit well in my hands (Logitech used to make one that I really liked, but it's probably been at least 15 years since they stopped making it, and their more recent controllers are all much smaller). Historically, the Playstation controllers have been particularly bad. The PS4 controller is much better than previous generations, because they adjusted the shape to make it less cramped, but it's still too small. The XBox One controller is a much better size, but for me at least, it hurts my hands to use the RB and LB buttons because of how I have to twist my hands to press them (whereas with the PS4 controller, it's really easy to move my fingers between the R1/L1 and R2/L2 buttons). The Switch Pro Controller is not quite as large as I would like, but it sits far better in my hands then either of those controllers (or any 3rd party controller that I've tried in recent years), and while it's not quite as easy to move my fingers between R/L and ZR/ZL on the Switch Pro Controller as it is  on the PS4 controller, it's close. So, for me at least, the Switch Pro Controller is far more comfortable than either the XBox One or PS4 controllers (or any 3rd party controller that I've found in recent years). So, from a comfort standpoint, this controller is a _huge_ win for me. No other controller is even close.I very much wish that the analog sticks were lined up like they are with the PS systems. Most of the controllers that I've used over the years have had the analog sticks on the same level, and I much prefer that to having them staggered like the XBox systems do and the Switch Pro Controller does. However, the comfort improvements with the shape and size of the controller vastly outweigh that problem for me.I have heard that the dpad on the Switch Pro Controller isn't that great, and some folks end up pressing up or down when they mean to press left or right (or vice versa), but that hasn't been a big problem for me, and there are videos on youtube which show you how to fix that problem. So, it's disappointing that they didn't make a better dpad, but it hasn't been enough of an issue for me to care.Ultimately, the Switch Pro Controller is so much better for me than any other controller currently on the market that I'm actually using it not only on my Switch, but I'm also using it on the PC, PS3, and PS4. I had to get adapters to get it to work on the PS3 and PS4, but it works, and for me at least, it's a huge improvement. If I had an Xbox of any kind, I'd get the appropriate adapter and be using it there too. Right now, the Switch Pro Controller is the only controller that I use.As an interesting bonus, the fact that the Switch Pro Controller has digital triggers actually makes playing games on systems whose official controllers have analog triggers more pleasant (even aside from the comfort improvements that come with the shape of the controller), because all of the games that I play either just treat them as buttons anyway or use them for something like the speed you run at, and I've never wanted to run at anything other than full speed, so having a simple button to press rather than having to push in an analog trigger and make sure that I press it in all the way is a really nice improvement. I'd probably feel differently if I played racing games (which apparently like to use the analog triggers for their throttle), but for the games that I do play, it's been great. And of course, if you only use the Switch Pro Controller on the Switch, then the way the triggers work is never a problem, because that's the way that all of the official Switch controllers are.So, from both a comfort and functionality standpoint, this controller is a huge win for me.",3 people found this helpful

Nintendo USB Switch Pro Controller,4.0,Better than Joy-Con,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on October 8, 2022",Color: Black | Edition: Single,True,"It's a nice, quality controller, and a much needed upgrade over the Joy-Con controller that's included with the Switch.It's overpriced, like everything Nintendo sells. But I was surprised to see that the quality is far superior to the Joy-Con quality, which costs even more. Obviously, the Joy-Con's have their place. I would say, if you fall into one of these categories, you'll want to pickup the Pro controller:- You're an adult, used to XBOX and/or PS controllers.- Your Switch stays connected to the TV dock all the time.It's very similar to the XBOX controller in button layout. The size is in that sweet spot range for medium/large hands. All the buttons and sticks feel nice. It has a dense feel to it, and I don't feel any plastic creaking...it's quality. I also appreciate the ability to have it charging while I'm playing, without having to pay for a charge grip. My only complaint is the price, as I've already stated. But that's an overall complaint I have with Nintendo in general.As an adult that only plays the Switch connected to my TV, I wouldn't play without this. I definitely recommend it without a doubt for that use case.",16 people found this helpful

Nintendo USB Switch Pro Controller,4.0,Great controller with one main problem *UPDATE 07/07/18*,"Reviewed in the United States on May 21, 2018",Color: Black | Edition: Single,True,"*UPDATE*After a day with the controller, I decided to call Nintendo's customer support. They ran me through the typical home diagnostics (update system/controllers, perform ""input test"") and then recommended I send in the controller for repair. So I sent it in.Within a couple weeks, I was opening the box they sent back, and the receipt said ""Service Performed: Product Replacement"". So I guess they just gave me a newer controller? (10 years ago I sent in a Wii, and they returned a replacement Wii, so I guess that's just how they often do it.)I loaded Puyo Puyo Tetris and tried out the controller in Tetris, and the dpad seemed to worked flawlessly. After playing some actual games, I feel like there is still some odd sensitivity that causes me to mess up a direction sometimes, but not like it did before. I will probably still play Puyo Puyo with the JoyCons.I'll leave my rating of the product at 4 stars, since it should have worked that well in the first place, but I am now very happy with my controller.I might want another one someday though, so hopefully this doesn't have to happen again.*END UPDATE*After reading about how the corded controllers tend to have 0-2 frames of input lag, and knowing that I'd rather not play most games with the joycons, I decided to get a pro controller along with my new Switch.Now, the only game I've played is Puyo Puyo Tetris, so I haven't really tested all the functionality of the controller (I'll play Super Mario Odyssey soon though), so I'm not sure about the quality of the control sticks or how well the trigger buttons work yet. But here is what I know:ProsLooks really sleek ( I only see two screws; phillips head)Charging cable plugs into top of controllerTriggers/bumpers have a bit more resistance than the Wii U gamepad bumpers, which were definitely too easy to pressButtons are all pretty big, including dpadSmaller buttons (Plus, Minus, Home, and screenshot) are conveniently located within thumb reachEvery part of it feels good to touchConsCharging cable is USB, but only seems to work if plugged into the switch dock's USB portUp on the dpad is too easy to pressSo that last point is really upsetting; in Puyo Puyo Tetris, you need to press dpad up a lot to instantly drop tetris blocks, but there is a high chance I will drop them accidentally whenever I press left or right on the dpad. Dpad down has significantly more resistance and I will never accidentally press that. For many games this might not be an issue, but I honestly think I'll have to use joycons for Puyo Puyo Tetris. It's not horrible, but I should be able to use this controller well for any game, so there's no way I can give it five stars.I will also note that I prefer to grip gamecube controllers with two fingers up on each hand (i.e. one each for L, R, ZL, and ZR), but this controller seems a bit less comfortable that way, probably because your middle fingers have less leverage, since the trigger buttons are smaller and not curved. However, the buttons are positioned such that having only one finger for two buttons is quite natural (more so than with joycons). Using only your index fingers is probably more ergonomic anyways.Overall I really like this controller. I don't have a lot to compare it to, but I've played Super Smash Bros. Melee competitively for a long time (which means I've gone through a lot of gamecube controllers, and often cleaned them/fixed them myself), and this controller feels like high quality hardware. I'm just really disappointed about the dpad up button being to easy to depress. Maybe other people/pro controllers don't have this problem, but it seems like something that shouldn't have been overlooked.",5 people found this helpful
Nintendo USB Switch Pro Controller,5.0,The Best Controller,"Reviewed in the United States on January 31, 2023",Color: Black | Edition: Single,True,"Pro controllers are the best for a reason.

Nintendo USB Switch Pro Controller,4.0,"weird d-pad, good overall","Reviewed in the United States on September 7, 2022",Color: Black | Edition: Single,True,"Something about the d-pad's construction makes it prone to misinputs. If you hit anywhere but the outermost edge of each directional, you have a good chance to experience one of the adjacent buttons being input before the intended input. A good demonstration is if you rock your thumb back and forth on the down button, you will experience left and right inputs as well.Otherwise, this is a nice controller. Worth the money you're charged? No, this thing should be 60 dollars. It's got fairly nice sticks that tend on the sensitive side, the face and shoulder buttons are satisfying to press without being particularly noisy or rattly with the plastic, the grips are weird but they work. the d-pad is kinda the worst part of the controller. that's not unique to nintendo in this case but the point is if you want a controller good for 2d games or games controlled primarily by d-pad you should find something else or just stick with the joy-cons.",4 people found this helpful

Nintendo USB Switch Pro Controller,4.0,Update: not that bad.,"Reviewed in the United States on February 3, 2020",Color: Black | Edition: Single,True,"UPDATE MAY 2020: Not that badSo after I wrote my initial review, I was able to get the stripped screw off (and destroyed the grip in the process, having to order replacements from ebay). Then over the ensuing months I tore apart the controller probably 20 times, trying different variations of the tape trick to fix the D-pad with varied success. The tape did largely correct the false inputs, but at the cost of sometimes not registering button presses. In the end, I decided to take off all the tape and use it as it was originally designed to be used, and guess what? It isn't all that bad. Sure, when you do the input test in Switch settings it registers LOTS of false inputs, but this is less noticeable during actual game play. Now granted, I'm not a professional gamer, but I used the D-pad extensively to play Rayman Legends and Super Mario Maker, and it worked just fine. So in conclusion, yes, the D-pad is far from perfect, it's a major blemish in an otherwise perfect controller and a disgrace for Nintendo, but NO, it is not as bad as everyone makes it out to be. It's probably still the best Switch controller out there at the time of writing. My advice is to buy it and spend some time actually using it before buying into all the negative hype and trying to mess with it. It really isn't all that bad. (with regards to my original review, everything I had said about the design and ergonomics still holds true, even with the aftermarket replacement grips I had to install).------Original review:First off, this controller looks and feels amazing. It's probably the most ergonomic controller I've ever held, and *almost* everything about it feels extremely well-built. But I say ""almost,"" because there's one major inexcusable flaw that just ruins it for me, and that's the D-pad. If you do a quick search, you'll see that this has been an issue with Pro Controllers since the very first model. The D-pad is way too squishy, and registers incorrect inputs when you move between directions quickly. It just blows my mind, how Nintendo, the company that INVENTED the D-pad can get away with making such a poorly designed sub-par one and putting it inside their Pro controller. There IS a fix, but it requires opening the controller and putting tape on the chip.  I attempted it, but ended up stripping one of the screws and now it'll be impossible to ever open it up. So I'm stuck with a $70 ""premium"" controller with a D-pad that's so imprecise that it's borderline unusable. If playing games with a D-pad is at all important to you, save yourself the headache and frustration and buy a PS4 controller and an 8bitdo or Mayflash receiver.  I used to always prefer official accessories going all the way back to the NES, but sadly, this whole experience has made me lose faith in Nintendo.",5 people found this helpful

Nintendo USB Switch Pro Controller,5.0,The only way to play a docked Switch,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on January 28, 2022",Color: Black | Edition: Single,True,"Nintendo Switch Pro Controller: $69.39 at the time of reviewI stood in line on launch day in 2017 to get my hands on a Nintendo Switch. The combination of portable and big screen play is hard to beat and though I don’t travel as much I still like the ability to pick my Switch up off the dock and play elsewhere. The reality of my gaming these days though is in front of the TV so a couple of years ago I finally broke down and bought a Pro Controller. It was really the best gaming choice I’ve made in a long time.*What I liked*:This controller is *much* more comfortable than the two Joycons that come with the Switch, even when they’re in the holder.The battery life is second to none in all of the top consoles. I think I might charge this thing like once a month.All of the controls feel really good. The buttons have the right amount of key travel. The analog sticks have the right resistance and bounce-back. And the d-pad is about as good as a d-pad can be (which is to say… good but not great).*What I didn't like*:I was going to say something about the cost of this controller, But after a quick search of XBox and Playstation controllers, I see that it is directly in line with the competition. So it’s a little high, but so are all the other options.*The Bottom Line:*This is, without exception, the most comfortable way to play games on the Switch. It may be on the spendier side, but the comfort, battery life, and ease of use make it a no-brainer for people who spend a lot of time with their Switch docked.

Nintendo USB Switch Pro Controller,4.0,Pricy but solid,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on September 26, 2018",Color: Black | Edition: Single,True,"Where to begin...I've always been fine with the Joycons, Handheld mode, in the grip, or one in each hand. I don't mind any of those control methods, nor do I find their D-Pad buttons to be a problem. But I bought this controller for Smash Ultimate and to see what all the fuss was about, because I don't want my Joycons breaking in a moment of carelessness.I thought the Joycons were solid enough for the most part, but this thing, you could practically crack chestnuts with it. From the minute I opened the box and took it in hand, I thought ""this isn't the prettiest thing I've ever seen, but this thing is sturdy!""I charged it up right out of the box, played a bit with the wired connection (haven't had any lag problems at all in Wizard of Legend with it) and it finished charging from the Switch dock in a couple hours. Over the next month, I played with it every day when my Switch was docked (I just stopped taking hte Joycons off the main unit when docking it since getting this). It took, with about an hour or more of play per day, maybe a month before I got a ""low battery"" warning from this controller.Analog sticks are definitely taller, and face buttons are definitely bigger than the Joycons. That felt a bit odd at first, but I can switch between this and the Joycons/handheld mode for any game I own without trouble. The only difference I had to get used to is the placement of the + and - buttons; rather than being above each thumb as on the Joycons, they're between my hand here.I've had no troubles with the D-Pad, and find I rather enjoy it. Got this thing back in April, and have had no troubles at all with either analog stick or the D-Pad. (Which registers up, down, left, right, or diagonals only if I press them- no false positives at all from my Pro Controller.)Reads Amiibo just fine, I place them in the center of the controller to scan them in after I remember the right thumbstick does nothing .This is an entirely optional purchase for me, especially as I've always been more of a handheld gaming man, and am perfectly fine with the Switch's provided controller setup. But the Pro Controller is the best-feeling thing I've held that I can recall, as far as gaming goes. (Note: I've owned Game Boys, DSes, the Gamecube and Wii, and the Logitech Cordless RumblePad 2 for my PC, and that's basically it besides the 8bitdo NES30 Pro.)I have no fears of anything ever breaking this Nintendium-forged artifact, and it still looks as new as it did out of the package down to minute details. Also, the battery is massively overkill- I love it.If you think you'd like one of these, and are okay with whatever the asking price is at the moment, go right ahead. You can use it with Windows and Android phones or tablets as well, so if this controller lasts as long as my old Logitech has, $70 should average out to maybe pennies per month, especially since it works with a bunch of different machines. Planning to keep it until it wears out decades from now.",17 people found this helpful

Nintendo USB Switch Pro Controller,5.0,The most comfortable switch controller to play docked,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on February 18, 2019",Color: Black | Edition: Single,True,"This thing feels really well built. The controller has a good quality feel to it, plus it feels just the right weight to make it feel secure in my hands. At first it felt a little big since I had been using the joycons mostly, but i quickly got used to it. The price can be a bit hard to justify, but i paid it since I knew that it wasnt a gamble. There are cheaper options out there that might feel this good, but i knew FOR SURE, that this one would be good. And it didnt dissapoint.Pros:- Good placement for the analogs- Nice big face buttons- Nice clicky shoulder buttons (not loud)- HD Rumble- Great motion controls- Great for 3D games- Comes with a high quality USB-C to A cableCons:- Price is a bit high- The analogs have a longer travel so it can feel a bit off putting if you are coming in straight from a Joycon like i was.- Not great for 2D platformers- The home button and screenshot buttons are a bit awkward to reach while playing.Overall this controller is great for games like Zelda BotW, Mario Odyssey, Doom, Ys, Mario Kart, etc, but i don't recommend it for 2D platformers like New Super Mario Bros U, The Messenger, Axiom Verge or Dead Cells. It will function alright, and i bet after playing for a bit your hands get used it, but for me it wasn't ideal and since I have a SN30 Pro, I use that one specifically for 2D platformers and this for everything else.The battery life is certainly impressive. I used it for over a week before I had to charge it, but then I dont do heavy gaming on the most part. My only real complaint is that the home button and the screenshot buttons can be a little difficult to find while playing.Also, take into account that this thing is not really portable. Not only is it big, but it keeps coming on and scanning for the switch each and every time a button is pressed. This is definitely a controller to keep beside the dock for docked playing, and NOT in your bag for hand held or table top. One of the times i packed this and brought it along for table top playing I found it had turned the switch on while it was in the bag. Its also kinda big, so definitely keep it at home. If you want portability go for the SN30 Pro, if you want comfort, go with this.Overally I think its a great controller, my biggest gripe is the price.",
Nintendo USB Switch Pro Controller,5.0,Highly Recommend over Joycons,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on March 4, 2021",Color: Black | Edition: Single,True,"So we just got these the other day, so this isn't a review on their longevity. However, we absolutely love these controllers in comparison to the joy cons. These are SOOO much better.We've been playing Age of Calamity in 2 player mode, and it was a huge pain and no fun to do with the Joy cons. These controllers are worlds better. They are a little big compared to a PS4 controller, but a better shape than the combined joycons.They have a nice heft to them, and they're rechargeable. A lot of the 3rd party controllers for the Switch weren't rechargeable,  and most, if not all, were not compatible with amiibos. If amiibos matter to you, it might be worth noting that the PowerA controllers and other 3rd party controllers probably aren't compatible.As for their charge, we charged them straight out of the box, played with them about every night for the past week and they still have a charge to them. I can't really quantify that in hours, but they definitely seem to last longer than our PS4 controllers (which are a couple years older to be fair).Last point of note is the button mapping. Trying to play Age of Calamity with 1 joycon per person, the buttons on each controller is limited, and the button mapping was confusing and aggravating. Having a controller or complete set of Joycons per person is really the best way to play, and it's definitely less aggravating. I'm not the best gamer, so when the button layout became too confusing with the joycons, I just ignored the confusing buttons (which in this particular game included the button to heal yourself).Last points of note is that they do come with their own charging cords, which plug right into the side of the Switch docking station for easy charging. They are a Type C cord, so most phone charges would probably work as well. And they don't have a spot to plug in headphones or a mic, but neither do the joycons.",One person found this helpful

Best Nintendo controller yet!",
Nintendo USB Switch Pro Controller,3.0,"Mediocre at best, unresponsive and flimsy at worst!","Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on February 6, 2021",Color: Black | Edition: Single,True,"So I've had this Pro controller for a month now and felt I'd been hands on long enough for a full review. Gotten about 150hours on Monster Hunter Generations and played a little Breath of the Wilds,I'm coming from 30+ years of gaming experience and have used every leading console developers (Nintendo, Sega, Microsoft, Sony) 1st party controllers since NIntendo Entertainment System onwards to today. I've owned many, but have used all of them extensively at some point. I've been on PS4 extensively since lunch, easily putting 2k+ hours a year, and 3k hours on Monster Hunter World since launch. So PS4 controller is my most relevant comparison now so you know were im coming from.So firstly, I consider the Pro Controller to be a big improvement over the standard Switch Joy Cons. The Joy Cons ar3 just way to small, right Anolog stick in particular hurts my average sized hands after 30min of use, and button spacing isn't great. To be fare, there Controllers ment for a handheld and in that space they do there job reasonably well. So if you want a more traditional Controller for couch gameing, it's the Pro or a GameCube controller clone, and the Pro is probably a better choice assuming you need motion controls.The Switch Pro controller isn't terrible for sure. Size is fine, maybe slightly small, but decent for average man hands and probably great for smaller hands. But immediately I noticed the Anolog Sticks aren't great. The press function is too tight, Anolog placement feels off and need to be about 25% bigger. I've heard ALOT of stick drift issues, but a month isn't long enough for that to be a issue. Face buttons fell a little mushy, no click or feed back at all. And the face buttons are raised far too much, makeing simultaneously pressing two buttons inaccurate. The ZR/ZL triggers aren't variable at all, this could be particularly frustrating on a racing game, as it's either full or no throttle. I don't mind them not being variable since I play RPGs mostly, and they feel responsive. However the L/R shoulder buttons are awful! They drop inputs frequently and sometimes don't register promptly. Unfortunately many games use shoulder inputs frequently, Monster Hunter GU being a strong example of were this is a issue. It seems to be because the actual button press happens on the outer edges, meaning to get a responsive touch you need to hold them with fingers in claw like hold. This causes alot of finger fatigue on medium sized hands and surely far worse on large hands. 4 way D-Pad is fine, and probably better than PS4 controllers. I've also noticed the left grip moves slightly already, the grips are separate pieces and shift slightly. They don't feel like there breaking, but it's unnerving to have this in 30days. Finally my biggest gripe is there is absolutely no 3.5mm standard headset inputs on the controller, and I've been told USB-C inputs don't work either. So you still need to use the Switch 3.5mm input for a headset. This is 16years behind other console devs, and is completely unexeptable in the age of online gaming.3 stars I'd is very fare, it's not terrible and unfortunately is probably your only choice for a traditional Switch controller. But aside fantastic battery life and decent ergonomics, it well below what I've come to expect from Sony and Microsoft since lunch of Xbox360 in 2005.",5 people found this helpful
Nintendo USB Switch Pro Controller,4.0,What You Should Know About the Pro!,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on February 6, 2018",Color: Black | Edition: Single,True,"So originally I got this controller because I needed something other than the controller grip that was included with the Nintendo Switch which just wasn't cutting it for me. The Joy Cons themselves, while are impressive little controllers, can be frustrating at times due to their size and the size of the buttons being so small. This is especially apparent for games like Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild where you need those precise controls in order to really take full advantage of the combat mechanics.So I bought this and I've got to say that I'm pretty impressed. First off, being someone who's always played Playstation and used to having the analog sticks being side by side,  I was worried that the directional stick layout which is very similar to Xbox One's layout, would take some time to get used to but that turned out to not be the case. Not only do they work great but I also adjusted to it very quickly and had a blast using this. The controller feels lighter than my PS4 controllers and it fits snug in my grip. It didn’t cramp up my hands like the Joy Con controller grip did. The grips have a nice texture to them that keeps them cool and easy to hold for long periods of time and with the buttons also being a lot bigger then the Joy Cons, I don't have much of an issue with hitting the wrong buttons. Also this controller is rocking a rechargeable battery that boasts a 40 hour life span on a single charge. Since I’ve gotten the controller a couple weeks ago, I’ve only had to charge it once, which is a major plus compared to other controllers like the Duelshock 4 which I’m lucky if I get a good 8 hours out of. I'd even go as far to say that the RZ & LZ trigger buttons are better than both Playstation's and Xbox's counterparts. The buttons seem to travel less distance to activate so it feels like they're responding quicker. Other pluses to this controller is that all the buttons found on the Joy Con make their way over onto this controller, it has the reader which lets you use Aiimbos with it, and its a very quick transition if you want to swap from the Joy Cons to the Pro controller during gameplay. There are some cons and things I would have liked to have seen different to this controller. For one, there’s no dedicated audio jack on the controller for headphone users, the rumble feature feels like its more centered in the controller rather then it being at the grips, I wish there was some more color variations then just the dark gray/black, and for it being a PRO Controller one might think that there would be extra buttons, features, or the ability to remap the button formats, but there are none of these. At the end of the day though, if it came down to me having to choose between buying another pair of Joy Cons or buying this, I would hands down go with this. And if you have bigger hands or you’re just used to using the classic grip style wireless controller than I definitely recommend this.",5 people found this helpful

Nintendo USB Switch Pro Controller,5.0,"My new favorite controller, so far!","Reviewed in the United States on January 11, 2020",Color: Black | Edition: Single,True,"Before I got the Switch Pro Controller, the Xbox One controller was my favorite. It has a great ergonomic design, nice feeling sticks, and a good weight. I pretty much thought that it was the perfect design for a controller.After I got the Pro Controller though, my opinions changed.The Pro Controller has a great ergonomic feel as well. The face of the controller is nice and large, and it has a matte finish to it. While the grip handles are a bit to small for my liking, the controls make up for it. The sticks feel has as good if not better than the Xbox controller's sticks, and I actually prefer the grip design of the Pro sticks. The Pro Controller face buttons are also miles better than the Xbox controller face buttons. While the Xbox buttons are only clicky, the Pro Controller buttons are nice and mushy, with a satisfying click at the end of the travel. The Pro Controller face buttons are also very large, which is something I didn't know I wanted.Other things that make the Pro better than the Xbox controller include: motion controls, heavier weight, and a better d-pad.That being said, the Pro Controller isn't perfect. While the aforementioned d-pad is better than the Xbox d-pad, it's still not great. The Pro is notorious for it's less than average d-pad. The size is a bit on the small side, and the d-pad is quite loose, which makes it prone to false inputs. Later revisions of the Pro Controller have improved on it though, and it's a least useable if nothing else.Overall though, I have to say that the Pro Controller has become my favorite controller to use. It's a shame that it really only works well on Nintendo Switch (it does have Bluetooth support for other devices, but you have to use external programs and the signal is prone to input lag), making it so that I can't use it on all devices.If you want the best controller experience on Switch, I think this controller definitely has to be on your final shortlist.",

Nintendo USB Switch Pro Controller,4.0,"Good controller, not great, definitely not professional grade","Reviewed in the United States on April 28, 2021",Color: Black | Edition: Single,True,"I mainly use this for PC gaming but obviously it pairs well with the Switch. Which imo you may as well buy this asap after getting a Switch because the joycons are the worst input devices I've ever used in my 40 years on Earth. The Golden Tee trackball during 25 cent chicken wing night at the local bowling alley 20 years ago is more reliable and accurate than joycons. But I'm getting off topic.The grip is comfortable. I prefer the way the analog/dpad is setup compared to Playstation controllers. Unlike most Xbox controllers it comes with a charging cord instead of hoping you buy AA batteries in 20XX. Buttons are nice and responsive, the right trigger has taken a pounding since I've bought it and seems to be holding up just fine. Rumble feels fantastic on both Switch and PC. This is obviously the way to go if you need a Switch controller and don't want to mess with adapters or 3rd party pad.So what's the issue? Why the 4 star review instead of 5?Simple. There's slop in the dpad. I can't think of any reason why when I hold left or right on the dpad it wants to also toggle between up and down randomly. If you're considering this controller and you play games that require very precise dpad inputs like fighting games or kaizo Mario then I suggest looking elsewhere.When something is called ""pro"" there's a weight to that word. It has connotations of being precise and well built to a standard that would be acceptable to professionals. I'm not a pro gamer by any means at all, I'm not even good enough to be called an amateur. But I believe anyone who plays any kind of game only wants to experience failure due to their own actions. Not because the controller gave a false input.",
Nintendo USB Switch Pro Controller,4.0,Eveything is great except... (Updated),"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on June 25, 2019",Color: Black | Edition: Single,True,"...the Directional Pad is *very* subpar. If you're only going to use it for accessing features or items like in Super Mario Odyssey or Breath of the Wild, it works just fine. However if you're going to use it for retro or 2D games it leaves much to be desired. There's no central pivot point like in most every good D-Pad allowing you to hit Up, Down, Left, and Right at the same time and they are sensitive so you will be hitting directions you don't mean to. There's ways to modify it and there's tutorials all over YouTube, but you will have to disassemble the whole thing to do it. I have yet to do it but people have said it makes it a lot better.That said everything about this controller is fantastic. It's not a nice weight, feels quality. It is by far the most comfortable controller I've ever held. It lasts seemingly forever. It says 40 hours but I've yet to put a dent in the battery icon even after extended play. Motion controls are flawless and precise. If it wasn't for the D-Pad I'd say this is the best controller ever made. I don't know why Nintendo dropped the ball on that considering they are the ones who perfected them.If you're looking for something for classic or 2D games line the Online NES games, Sonic Mania, or Mario Maker this might not be fore you but all of your 3D titles couldn't be played on a better controller. If you want something for 2D games, there's some for sale here on Amazon that look like SNES controllers but with analog sticks (ones without sticks are also available) with an amazing D-Pad. Not sure if I'm allowed to mention them by name in reviews but they're not hard to find if you search for Nintendo Switch controlers.Update:After using this on Super Mario Maker 2 the D Pad works a lot better out of the box than I expected. Though not perfect it's fine for casual play but I'm sure people who do kizo levels might find problems. I've been using this with few problems. Occasional accidental diagonal presses but not nearly as frequent as what I saw when first trying out some of NES games. Might need it to be broken in a little. Still prefer the D Pad on the other controller but this one is so much more comfortable in my hands.",6 people found this helpful

Nintendo USB Switch Pro Controller,3.0,"Great feel, Terrible QC","Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on September 25, 2022",Color: Black | Edition: Single,True,"Let me just start by saying that, externally, Nintendo has made a great controller. The buttons and triggers are crisp and the grip feels great. The controller is small for my hands but that is okay. The one and biggest problem with this is the lack of QC. I've had multiple Pro Controllers, each one came with stick drift. Mind you, each one I ordered was brand new unopened.  Nintendo has a big problem with joystick drift and I feel as though with all the backlash on the joycon drift they would go out of their way to fix it in their Pro Controllers. Another thing is the price. I cannot recommend getting this at a $70 price point when things like the Gullikit King Kong 2 Pro or 8BitDo Pro 2 exist. (Especially with the $70 8BitDo Ultimate coming out soon). I would pay $50 max since this thing is prone to stick drift and its essentially inevitable. Conclusion: Don't get this controller unless you are a die-hard fan of Nintendo. Opt for the 8BitDo Pro 2 or even better the Gullikit King Kong 2 Pro which can wake your switch up from sleep and it promises no stick drift. Or, you can wait for the 8BitDo Ultimate to release at the same price point (it also comes with a charging dock). Thank you for reading!",2 people found this helpful

Both sets I own occasionally have responsiveness issues.  Frustrated, I turned back to the Switch Pro controller, and MAN, WHAT A DIFFERENCE.My connectivity problems are gone.  My joy con drift (granted, this is still new) is gone.  And the controller is solid, well-built, and enjoyable to play on.

In every sense of the word.,"Reviewed in the United States on May 29, 2017",Color: Black | Edition: Single,True,"This is the best controller I've ever used. I own a PS4 and, god damn, this is leaps and bounds ahead.First, the sticks. They feel buttery smooth, just like they're gliding along. The grips are well build and feel good. They require a good amount of pressure to click, and it's perfect.Now, the buttons. The ABXY buttons are large, with around a 1cm diameter. As you smash the A button in Mario Kart, you'll appreciate it a lot. They don't hurt, and while they're a little mushy, they begin to feel perfect after around 5 minutes.The D-Pad is a traditional Nintendo D-Pad. They make the best ones, hands down. This one stands up to that quality perfectly. It feels clicky, but not like a button. Way above the PS4 D-Pad and a little clickier than the Wii U one. It's perfect also.The triggers and bumpers (those buttons on the back of the controller), ZL, ZR, L and R also feel great. Like the ABXY buttons, they're large and a touch mushy. They feel like they were made for my fingers.I have larger hands, and this controller is the best one I've ever used. So much better than the Joy-Cons, so much better than anything you've ever used. A couple more small notes: the + and - buttons are nice and clicky, along with the HOME and the Capture button. Unlike the Wii Remotes and the Wii U Pro Controller, the player indicator lights are located on the front of the controller, in between the the two hand holds. It's not too bright, and they're green. Cool, right?I don't play enough of my Switch to test the 40 hour battery life, but damn, it's good. I've charged it maybe weekly with daily use. It's got a great battery. It's heavy enough to feel substantial, but not too heavy. It's perfect. (I know I keep saying that but it is.)The gyro feels good, the NFC is serviceable.In the box, by the way, is a USB-C cable. It works with the controller and the switch, as it's a fully standard cable. (For those who would think about using it with a USB-C laptop/phone, it's USB 2.0 not 3.0. It doesn't have the extra 5 connectors for USB 3.0.)I know it's $70. I know. It's worth it, though. Please don't buy a second set of Joy-Cons. Please buy this controller.

Nintendo USB Switch Pro Controller,3.0,A must for large hands or enthusiasts,"Reviewed in the United States on May 24, 2017",Color: Black | Edition: Single,True,"+It's very comfortable to hold and feels substantial in your hands. I want to stress how solid this controller feels and the build quality behind it. I can twist the grips pretty aggressively and they don’t give or make noise. In comparison Sony and Microsoft’s controllers creak and feel like they’ll break from noticeably thinner and weaker plastic.+The analog sticks are very comfortable, have little friction, and the edges have a nice grippy pattern. After 2000 hours of Splatoon 2 the analog sticks return to neutral and there’s no wobbling or drifting. The sticks do rub against the sides though and will produce some plastic dust. One disappointing problem I ran into was occasionally the right stick would register a click despite not being pressed down.+It uses USB-C and comes with 1 Nintendo branded USB-A to USB-C cable about 5 feet in length. Plugging it in to your Switch will instantly sync the controller.+It lasts 40 hours. That's not impressive compared to the Wii U's Pro Controller at 80 hours, but it's still going to make it near impossible to run out of juice if you're addicted to Zelda. The controller feature gyroscopes, HD Rumble, and NFC which reduce battery life.+The area your fingers get into contact with are matte, and you won't have to worry about scratches, fingerprints, or other blemishes if you take care of it.+I clean my hands religiously, but on other controllers, oils would still build up and get into the cracks and it’s pretty disgusting. I’ve had only extremely minor oil build up on this controller. Maybe the plastic is coated in an oleophobic coating? It’s strange, but that’s possibly the most impressive thing I can say about this controller.+You can use the controller on a PC as a generic input device. It does not work over USB and requires Bluetooth.-The only part the controller that is glossy plastic is at the top of the controller which comes shipped covered in a plastic protective sheet. This also happens to be where the USB cable plugs in. It’s going to get scratched. It might look nice, but functionally this is foolish. Why would you make the only area where the metal could come into contact with controller the one spot that could get easily scratched?-The D-Pad registers false inputs when pressed. As of this review, Nintendo has refused to acknowledge this design defect. It makes playing Puyo-Puyo Tetris and Tetris 99 impossible since pressing Up makes pieces drop instantly.-The L and R bumpers have a very small area we’re pressing them won’t register an input well. If you use the outer edges you probably will never run into this but it’s still worth mentioning.-The Share and Home buttons are way too close and similar in shape to the + or - button, and there's no intuitive way to feel for which you're pressing. It’s too bad they aren’t + and - shaped like on the JoyCons.-The Switch has an option to use the controller wired for reduced input latency, but for most people this is rather useless unless you buy a much longer cord.-There's no analog triggers, but that's because it has parity with the JoyCons. Still not an excuse and would have made this item far more valuable if supported.-I had a harder time feeling HD Rumble on this than the JoyCons. It's a subtle effect, but given the size and rigid nature of this controller, it really should have been amped up overall.-It's $70 MSRP. That's not only more than a game, it's more than the competitors. I know controllers are more complicated than ever and its build quality is far superior with the exception of the D-Pad, but that doesn’t make it any easier to swallow.Children and smaller handed people can probably get by with Joy-cons. If you find them too small, this controller will be a welcome bit of comfort.I have personally gotten a lot of use and enjoyment out of it, especially with Splatoon 2. The only reason I’m giving it three stars is because I expect more responsibility and the highest quality from Nintendo products. One of the major reasons to invest in this controller is the D-Pad. Nintendo practically invented the modern D-Pad. That they’ve allowed this defect to exist and be denied is a travesty.",8 people found this helpful

Nintendo USB Switch Pro Controller,4.0,Control stick wears on the housing - Worried about how long the controller will last.,"Reviewed in the United States on March 10, 2019",Color: Black | Edition: Single,True,"This controller just may replace the second-gen Sega Saturn joypad as my favorite first party controller ever.  It's comfortable as can be to hold, but I have just one concern.  The analog sticks rub on the face of the controller and wear the plastic down, it's white powder around either analog stick.  I just hope Nintendo is going to be supporting to their loyal players in a year or so when these things start wearing out.Back in the N64 days, the Nintendo customer service number on the sticker on every Nintendo product took care of their gamers and they sent me three new N64 Analog sticks for the controllers that got worn out for free.  Just the analog sticks, and I had to take apart the controllers to put them in.I've only had this particular controller for about a month and I've already had to clean off the plastic wear dust from the analog pads twice.It's a very comfortable controller, but I really think it's overpriced (same as their Joy-Cons) and I question just how durable it is after seeing this much wear and tear after some casual use during less than a month's time.I'm gonna really be upset if this expensive official controller wears out early, and I sure hope Nintendo's customer service is as good as it was 20 years ago when this control stick gives up the ghost like you can tell it's going to do.It's comfy, it's USB-C, good battery life, but the powdery wear around the thumbsticks really concern me.  They rub against the controller housing and I just can't see how this controller was designed like this with the wear parts.Going to try and be optimistic, but these kind of problems typically get bad enough to warrant getting upset about right after they're out of the warranty period...I sure hope Nintendo isn't skimping on quality or product support these days.",
Nintendo USB Switch Pro Controller,5.0,A Must Have for Nintendo Switch Owners!,"Reviewed in the United States on January 16, 2018",Color: Black | Edition: Single,True,"Overall the switch is mostly perfect. However, the biggest problem with the system is the controllers that come with them, the Joycons. As many reviewers had said before, they were so small after using them for more than an hour my hands were starting to cramp. Well, I decided to put some money into it and purchase the Nintendo Switch Pro Controller. Here are my thoughts on the pro controller.The Good:-The analog sticks: They are accurate, responsive and have the perfect feel.-The ABXY buttons: The ABXY are big when big=better. Because gaming is about being able to hit the right buttons, having huge buttons really is really helpful.-The feel of the controller: I know this is subjective but personally, the controller just feels right in the hands. Playing Splatoon 2 never felt better.-The features: Probably the thing that stands out most about the pro controller is the abundance of features. Not only does it have the haptic feedback but it also has motion controls, an NFC reader (for amiibo) and even rubber on the back of the controller to provide extra grip while playing.The Bad:-The D-Pad: One of the biggest problems with the pro controller is the D-Pad. Because of the way it is built, if you don't press on the D-Pad a certain way, it might be read as a mispress, leading to Link dying more than necessary.-The Triggers: This isn't really a problem but the triggers don't feel triggerlike. They don't have much travel and compared to the Xbox 1 controller they are mushy and unsatisfying. But other than that they're ok.-The Price: This is probably the most obvious one. Paying $70 for a controller albeit a nintendo one is hard to justify. Sure there are more expensive options but there are also cheaper options. You should really only pick up this gamepad if you have extra cash to set aside.The VerdictThe pro controller isn't really a necessity for anyone who is just looking to have fun, but if you are a pro gamer or a perfectionist who wants the best experience, the pro controller is a must-have.",2 people found this helpful
Nintendo USB Switch Pro Controller,5.0,Animal Crossing Drift Fix!,"Reviewed in the United States on April 27, 2020",Color: Black | Edition: Single,True,"Solution to calibrate pro controllers in Animal Crossing and fix automovementsI wrote this solution to solve the drifting in games like animal crossing with pro controller in other thread, and it worked for me and other people than reply me.**Note**: These are the steps I did, but I don't know if all steps are needed. But it seems to work.\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------I have done next steps with both pro controllers and both are working fine now.1. Restated the Nintendo Switch holding power off button and selected it. No controller plugged in by cable.2. I have calibrated the analog stick. Before each movement during the calibration proccess I have forced the middle position correcting the drifting.3. I have returned then to the screen telling me to push the analog stick to calibrate.4. I have pressed reset controller button (beside the USB port) a few seconds. Lights in front side of controller starts to change. I have released the button, putted the console on the desk, and pressed home button.5. I have returned to calibrate controller and it works fine now. No drifting, no cable, and point returns to the center changing to the cross.Now I have both controllers without drifting and Animal Crossing and Luigis Mansion 3 (the only games I had with the new driffting movements) are working correctly.All is so weird.I did the whole process with the switch outside the docker, and controllers now work with the switch inside and outside the docker.After restarting the Switch controllers still work fine.",2 people found this helpful
Nintendo USB Switch Pro Controller,4.0,Almost Perfect,"Reviewed in the United States on August 9, 2020",Color: Black | Edition: Single,True,"I play this mosty for PC games and steam. The controller has a nice feel to it and adds so much comfort to the hands from playing games in prolong time. Battery life is what makes this controller shine among the rest, long battery life is amazing, I charge my controller once or twice a month. It's really easy to sync bluetooth via PC to play games in steam.There are three things I do not like about this controller:1, it's the DPad, it's not very accurate when playing that mainly depends on it when moving, the arrows sometimes hits a combination between two unexpectedly and can cause frustration due to keys not registering properly.2, its the left and right top bottons, it does no justice when playing Racing games, it does not have the smooth feeling when using the xbox trigger buttons when you accelerate and reverse. The trigger buttons controls the speed in driving and this does not have it. If they added top analog trigger buttons it would make racing and shooting games a better experience.3, it's the three month manufacturer warranty, they should of stick to two years due to other peoples complaints of analog stick issues. Making players feel at ease with their expensive controller purchase with 2 year warranty would make this controller a lot nicer.Overall, controllers fine when playing with the original system and AAA games this was designed. Could of had better improvements that will make play other games a true fun gaming experience.",2 people found this helpful
Nintendo USB Switch Pro Controller,5.0,A Controller Every Switch Owner Should Have!,"Reviewed in the United States on April 27, 2020",Color: Black | Edition: Single,True,"I was skeptical of buying this controller since I was initially thinking that buying a pair of joycons would be the better option since it supports two users instead of a fixed one user; however, after months of playing with this controller and sharing it with my friends, I found out that both products have its uses and the pro controller is outstanding on its own. I was shopping for another pair of joycons, but instead I caved in buying this item from youtube reviews and friend recommendation, but I do not regret it for a second. I've had this product for a long time now and I use it for every game I've come across coming to over 50+ games. It is comfortable with a lot of features including rumble, gryo aiming, amiibo support, and compatability with a lot of games. The quality of build is also beyond expectations as this controller has been dropped well over 10 times from friends including myself without any hardware damages or any significant cosmetic damages. Not to mention, drift concerns are not a problem here since those affected the joy cons only. I would just like to sum this up by saying that as an Console user (Xbox and Playstation), it is a great way to ease into controls in switch games and it can be a lot more reliable, comfortable, and easier to play games on the switch. (Even if you play Smash Ultimate, it can be a great substitute for a joycon (unless you are a gamecube controller loyalist that is good on its own too))",
Nintendo USB Switch Pro Controller,5.0,Comfortable and much better than the joycons,"Reviewed in the United States on March 23, 2021",Color: Black | Edition: Single,True,"I'll cover what I think are the most important aspects of a controller.Comfort - The comfort of use is slightly better than a ps4 controller. The handles are filled out so if you need to use your pointer and middle fingers to use all 4 shoulder buttons, you won't need to curl your ring and pinky fingers too much to hold the controller handles, and they are rubber gripped.Shoulder buttons - good size buttons that are easier and more comfortable to use than the standard joycon controller. You can comfortably have space to cover all 4 shoulder buttons at once without your fingers touching. The only strange thing is that the R/L-Z buttons are actual buttons instead of triggers like on the xbox1 and ps4 controllers - IMO just a subtle nuance to get used to rather than an issue.Joysticks - good grip for thumb. Comparable to the ps4 joysticks.D-pad - it's an actual d-pad rather than just 4 separate buttons. Personally I prefer it this way so that you can easily feel your directional inputs instead of clicking a single button like on the joycon controller.If you're playing a switch game that requires more than a single joycon and the game isn't super smash brothers, then this controller is a great choice.",

Nintendo USB Switch Pro Controller,5.0,Don't settle for less than the REAL thing.  THIS is it!,"Reviewed in the United States on June 14, 2021",Color: Black | Edition: Single,True,"I bought a knock off ProCon when I first got the switch in March of 2020.  I thought that did the trick, at the time.  That is--it did, until I had pairing issues and until I realized that there had to be a reason Nintendo made one official ProCon.  This is TOTALLY worth it.  Do not buy anything but this!  You'll be incredibly glad you bought this.  It's ergonomically sound, it's light weight, the haptic feedback/rumble is perfect, and the game play is optimized like I really never believed it would be.There is absolutely a difference, and you can't properly experience the Switch without this official version of the ProCon from Nintendo.  If you've invested in the Switch, please do yourself a favor and get the Nintendo licensed version.  You will NOT be disappointed.  I bought this at $59.99, and while that may seem like a lot, it dwarfs anything that tries to imitate it (I tried several others), and it never has a problem pairing with the Switch.  I'm not a heavy gamer.  Also, the Joy-Con grip really only takes you so far.This would get 6 stars from me if that were possible.",
Nintendo USB Switch Pro Controller,5.0,Comfort and battery life are great,"Reviewed in the United States on April 13, 2021",Color: Black | Edition: Single,True,"First thing, this is actually quite a big controller compared to the Switch's tiny controller. Compare with Switch's joycon dock, this Pro controller is much beefier, and also a bit heavy. I don't know how this compares with Xbox or Playstation wireless controllers, but this surprised me on how thick and heavy it is. However, you will soon forget about it after you start playing the game.  The joystick placement is slightly different than the joycon, it's more spread out, your thumb will need to reach further to go from joystick to the D-pad.  The good thing is that the buttons are much bigger and vibrations are stronger. Battery life is also longer than joycon, full charge takes about 2 hours.  Is it worth it? If you mostly play single player games and feels the joycon are too small and crampy, you should definitely get it. If you just need another controller, you should think what game you are using the controller for, as some games need joycon style, some games for multiple players (expensive to get two of these instead of a pair of joycon). I use Switch in dock mode most of time, so getting this controller is great. If you play on the go perhaps you may not use this much.",

Nintendo USB Switch Pro Controller,5.0,Nintendo Switch Pro Controller,"Reviewed in the United States on October 12, 2022",Color: Black | Edition: Single,True,"This was a gift for my son, who is a big gamer.

Nintendo USB Switch Pro Controller,2.0,I hate wireless controllers,"Reviewed in the United States on July 30, 2022",Color: Black | Edition: Single,True,"I bought this hoping it would be an improvement from my 20-dollar wired controller I had bought for the Switch, but the cons are starting to outweigh the pros. I bought that controller because I have no interest in using the standard joycon that came with the system (I grew up with the old NES and enjoyed the wired controllers all the way through PS2 and I say if it ain't broke, don't fix it). Sadly, my old 20-dollar switch controller started going wonky with its left toggle and became very irritating trying to play Animal Crossing--my character kept trying to face south all the time and it was hard to move the cursor over items I wanted in my inventory.So, I bought this!I figured, well, it comes with a cord, maybe I can leave it plugged in all the time and screw the battery charging madness. It has rumble and the ability to use amiibo, so why not? I should've bought another 20-dollar one.On first impression, I liked the way this controller felt in my hands, the handles were slightly thinner than the other one I was using. But the buttons are not as tactile, which makes pressing them less sure than my old controller. The plus button is imbedded rather than protrudes, which makes it more difficult to press, a bad thing if you play Animal Crossing. I wanted to use the controller right out of the box, but it had to charge first. No problem, right? Wrong. The cord is super short! Unless you're a little kid who wants to sit on the floor, you can't play a game with this short cord, and that's not a good idea anyway. I had to sit forward on my couch to use it with the cord and my big modern tv started hurting my head pretty fast. I had to dish out more money to buy some other, longer cord that I'm praying will work. I had also figured I will put up with charging the thing and use it as a wireless controller. Nope. Just today, day 2 of having the controller, my AC character started walking left and I couldn't control it. Apparently, my Switch lost the signal to my controller: who tf needs that in the middle of gameplay? Also, the toggles are not as wide as my old controller. They are probably as wide as the joycon ones, which is not good. I bought the xbox-style controller for the bigger buttons and toggles. It's easier to grip and abuse the bigger toggles.I recommend this controller only if you like what I said above. You like charging your controller all the time? You like sitting close to your tv trying to play when you plug it in? You like mushy buttons and tiny toggles? Then go for it.",One person found this helpful

Nintendo USB Switch Pro Controller,5.0,Great way to use Switch as a Console,"Reviewed in the United States on November 5, 2019",Color: Black | Edition: Single,True,"I purchased this to play Skyrim on the Switch, particularly in docked mode.  Now, the Switch comes with a plastic holder that you can slot the half controls into to create a standalone controller for free.  I'll call this the ""standard"" controller further down.  So, why pay $60 or so for this?Well, in contrast to the standard Switch standalone controller, this has a very different feel to it.  Because the controller is larger, the left-thumb control has a lot more ""play"" to it.  This means there is more distance from the center to the ends.  This gives me more precise control in-between the edges when using this than the standard Switch controller.  And that can be crucial for some games.  The standard Switch thumb control can only move a very short distance from center to end, making precise control between the edges much harder.Also, it has the vibration feature built in and a much longer battery life than the standard Switch controller.  It pairs seamlessly with the Switch, and if you are using the Switch in a Docked mode, and have paired this controller, turning this controller on automatically turns on your Switch.If you find you play your Switch a lot in the docked mode, this is probably worth your money.  If you mainly play your Switch in handheld mode, this isn't worth the extra cash.Also, if you do a lot of multi-player games such as Super Smash Brothers Ultimate, and feel like spending a lot of money, the Switch can pair with up to 4 of these at once.",2 people found this helpful
Nintendo USB Switch Pro Controller,5.0,A Great Wireless Controller for my Nintendo Switch.,"Reviewed in the United States on June 13, 2021",Color: Black | Edition: Single,True,"When I first got my Switch, I got a wireless controller to go with it. But the problem with that controller is that it uses AA batteries, which I had to change every single time the batteries ran out. Plus, it does not have an NFC reader. So I had to go to my Switch and detach the right Joy-Con to use it. And it was a pain to pair it with the Switch.With this official Pro Controller, I don't even need to do those things anymore. No wireless pairing required. With the cable that can be used to charge the controller, my Switch can detect it automatically when plugged in and docked. I can use the NFC Reader with most of the Amiibo-Supported Games without having to detach the right Joy-Con to do so. No more changing the batteries for me. With 40 hours of battery life, I don't need to worry about charging it until it tells me to do so.With a good investment, this Pro Controller can mostly help eliminate the need of buying another pair of Joy-Cons which they can get the Drift from wear and tear, and/or sending them to Nintendo to get serviced.",

Nintendo USB Switch Pro Controller,5.0,Great for the first year..then drifting issues.,"Reviewed in the United States on August 27, 2020",Color: Black | Edition: Single,True,Update 8/31/20: Upgrading back to 5/5 stars! Turns out I accidentally turned motion control on without knowing it. Once I found that and turned it off the issue was gone.Please ignore my negative comment below.I bought this controller in January 2020 and up until the last week or so (August 2020) it was working great and I absolutely loved it. I was totally fine with paying what I did and would’ve happily done so again.Unfortunately around last week my controller started having an issue where the left analog stick was drifting the the left and nothing could fix it. I tried recalibrating the stick in the Nintendo Switch settings and it would fix it for about 30 seconds before it started drifting again.This issue is particularly noticeable in games like Mario Kart 8 Deluxe where my racer will start drifting to the left which makes racing almost impossible since I can’t control my own car drifting while racing.Sadly my warranty expired and I’m really annoyed that I paid so much only for it to break in less than a year. I take good care of it and always wash my hands before playing so it’s not an issue of poor treatment of the controller.I hope other people don’t have this issue but felt I should mention it since it happened to me.,2 people found this helpful

The rumble is ""regular"" but it feels actually very good with different intensities.The main downsides are lack of NFC and inability to wake up the switch, but I mainly use it for pc anyway.Overall I am completely pleased with both devices and the Switch Pro Controller is the one to get if you only need one for the switch and also if you enjoy 3D games more than 2D or platformers.But if you need a controller for the Switch than also works great with PC, Android and Mac, the 8BitDo's SN30 Pro+ is the best hand down.4.5/5 for both",4 people found this helpful
Nintendo USB Switch Pro Controller,5.0,Outrageous improvement over joycons,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on February 2, 2019",Color: Black | Edition: Single,True,"I finally upgraded to the pro controller after much time contemplating if it would really make a difference to me. I've been using the joycons since the launch of the Switch and while not perfect I can still appreciate their design concept.The one aspect of the pro controller that had me on the fence were the triggers. Honestly, that is the one thing I really don't like about the joycons. Everything else about the joycons I can work around. Well, pictures don't do the pro controller justice, the triggers are absolutely fantastic and I certainly don't see myself ever using the joycons again when it comes to playing games that utilize the triggers extensively.Not just the triggers but everything about the pro controller is a huge step up from the joycons. The buttons are bigger, the analogue sticks give a great grip with your thumbs and the controller feels nice and snug in the hands. The material is much more friendly during longer sessions. That was another gripe I had with the joycons; after a period of time the sticks and triggers would be slippery. I managed it by having a cloth nearby to give it a nice wipe occasionally. Not the case with the pro controller, there is much more friction to it.It's a must have accessory for me and I give it a 5 star because I think it's a fantastic controller and fixes every issue I had with the joycons. I suppose if there is one thing I would change about it that would have to be the placement of the right analogue stick. Personally, I'd like it above the buttons so the two sticks would be symmetrical but I don't think it merits deducting a star.",

I bought the Pro Controller because my joy-cons haven't suffered from the cursed drift and I wanted them for playing mostly Just Dance.The controller feels great, it's very well built and it was recognized by my Switch right away. I've played Smash, Mario Kart, BOTW, ACNH and even some games on Steam and haven't had an issue. This is definitely a great purchase;  as someone else mentioned, this is a great alternative to buying other joy-cons.I kinda wish I could give this controller a 4.5 review because of the D-pad.

Nintendo USB Switch Pro Controller,5.0,Always buy OEM.,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on June 20, 2019",Color: Black | Edition: Single,True,"I got this within a week of buying the Switch, and probably the one piece of advice I heard from everyone is ""just buy the Pro Controller from Nintendo"". I got a cheap 3rd party authorized USB controller while I was buying games in store, played some games but quickly just decided to grab the Pro Controller. After I used it, I realized why everyone loves it. It's almost perfectly built, feels great and natural, and so many features for the controller. Wireless works fantastically, battery lasts forever, Rumble feels good, and the motion controls work wonderfully. The motion controls are probably the biggest here - I didn't realize that games on the switch actually depended on the motion controls, which I really missed out on when I had a third party controller. With this, there's so many opportunities for motion control to provide a natural third joystick, especially in games like Breath of the Wild. Works fantastically. My only gripe is that, since it is so convenient, I love to just throw it in my backpack with my switch and its case, and go out for the day. However, there's nothing supplied to help protect the joysticks in transit. I would have loved to see easily detachable thumbsticks, or some kind of bumper, so that I can quickly store + access the controller without needing a protective case or worrying about the condition of the joysticks getting jostled. I know that's not really a trend with many comparisons, like xbox or playstation, but given what I heard about this controller having long-term issues with thumbsticks, it would make sense to me.",2 people found this helpful

Their size fits perfectly for us and are useable with the grips. I decided to get myself this Nintendo version of the pro controller since I play some RPGs and figured it would go well and maybe bring back some good vibes from my youth. I say that since this is built like a normal console controller. Very similar to the Xbox. The controller is larger then the joycons and the placement of buttons is awkward at first and took some time getting used to it. It feels great though and overtime it’s become my preferred controller. I wish however that it wasn’t so noisy. Every top face button pressed makes a loud sound. (I play usually at night when everyone is asleep) I enjoyed the joy cons because they weren’t as loud and I can separate my hands while relaxing on the couch or bed. If you already have joycons, and enjoy them, this is more of a luxury piece. I have not experienced analog drift yet with these though while I have on my joycons.",2 people found this helpful

This is probably my favorite controller of all time. The way it fits in my hands, it becomes a part of you. The buttons are clicky and the directional pad is much better than using the joycons. The battery life is amazing and it charges quickly through USB-C.If this worked cross platform fluidly, this would be my go to controller for all video games. It's very similar to the Xbox One controller, but the grips are a little bit thinner and I'm just able to get a more solid grip than the Xbox One controller.After months of use, it still works and feels like new. The construction is solid and there's no flex in the plastic when you grip it tight during intense moments.  I've gone through probably 3 Xbox one controllers because the plastic starts to squeak after a few months of use and the buttons become unresponsive. So Kudos to Nintendo for continuing to make quality controllers.The NFC tag works nicely for scanning amiibos if that's your thing.One warning, and this may have been fixed with a controller update, but after not using one of the controllers for a few months, the battery drained and would only worked while plugged in. Even with charging for a few hours, it wouldn't charge. I decided to just leave it charging for a few days (using the provided Nintendo USB C to A charger plugged into the switch) and it worked again.  The battery is the same as the 3DS battery and I guess when those are drained, they take a long while to charge. So for anyone whose controller won't charge, just try leaving it charge for a day or so!",13 people found this helpful

Nintendo USB Switch Pro Controller,5.0,Great product,"Reviewed in the United States on April 6, 2021",Color: Black | Edition: Single,True,"This is a great product. I was starting to have issues with the switch controls that came with the console, as I’ve read is common with the switch, so I ordered this to use while I send my nunchucks off two Nintendo to have them repaired.I honestly do not know if I will ever go back to using it as a handheld device because I love the pro controller so much. It is a great weight, it’s not too light and cheap feeling and it’s not too heavy. I love that it doesn’t take batteries and that you can just charge it and I also love the fact that you can plug it into the switch and play it as a wired controller once it gets low on battery and you don’t have to stop your gameplay.

Nintendo USB Switch Pro Controller,4.0,Plays like a dream,"Reviewed in the United States on August 17, 2019",Color: Black | Edition: Single,True,"This is a really well built controller! I'll get right to the point about what I enjoy about this:* joysticks play really nicely, very smooth and accurate* Great grips! The controller feels like it melts into your hands. In contrast to just using the joycon (which don't have grips) , you can actually give this controller a death grip and still feel comfortable.* Not advertised, but it works well on the Steam client! (Nintendo doesn't endorse it) Valve developers have worked on drivers to make this controller work on all steam games.* Durability feels excellent. It feels like it will not break for another 10 - 15 years.* Dpad feels good, a great leg up from the Nintendo 3DS DPad. Due to greater thickness than any 3ds, the controller allows for a more bubbly feel when pressing down on the DPad. 99% of games I've played: Mutant Mudds, the NES Library, and Megaman 11 feel awesome. It will suit just about anything you throw at it.There is however one caveat to this controller, while the DPad is great, I wouldn't recommend it for something like Tetris where you require incredibly precise controls. For expert play, it's possible to accidentally harddrop a piece onto the board. I don't know many other games that require intense precision on all 4 corners of DPad, but be aware that the DPad can make the occasional mistake.I'm generally satisfied with this controller. I try to use it as often as possible, as I feel that the joycon feel a little easy to abuse :P",One person found this helpful

So there's a strong temptation to skimp and buy a cheaper 3rd party model or some kind of adapter to let you reuse a controller from an older system. Don't do it. Don't waste your time. This is the best one.I purchased one of these shortly after buying my switch and tried a number of cheaper options to get around buying another one for ""player two.""  Yes, 8bitdio controllers work.  Yes, you can buy adapters that let you use Wii and Wii U controllers. Yes, they have those PowerA controllers that have the Gamecube design.  None of those options are as good as the Switch Pro Controller.I tried a PowerA controller (because I love the Gamecube controller) and it broke after a month.  Just don't bother with anything other than the Switch Pro Controller.  None of them have the grip, feel, weight and reliability.

It is big enough (for adult hands) to be comfortable for long gaming sessions. My 6 year old nephew doesn’t have any problems using it either. Good all around fit. The controller, itself, is built like a tank. I’ve dropped it a few times and have come to the conclusion that it might actually be indestructible. The controller has a bit if heft to it, but isn’t overly heavy. It does have a rumble function and an NFC reader for Amibos. My favorite thing about this controller is that the battery lasts forever. I don’t remember how many hours it lasts, but I’ve gone easily more than a week without recharging it while using it for several hours a day. The only con I can think of is that it is a bit pricey, but it is so so very much better than the drift-prone joycons. This is one if the best purchases I have made in a while.",

But I have to give in... this is my favorite controller.The charge lasts forever (supposedly 40hrs).  I haven't timed it but I think I have only charged it twice (I think) and I took it with me overseas as well as numerous ""local"" trips.  I have sunk over 100 hours in Zelda alone and have time in Mario Kart and Odyssey as well.  Not all of that time was with the Pro controller but so much so I have no clue how much.  My PS4 controller only lasts 1-2 gaming sessions before it needs to be recharged as a comparison ...and that's both the old and new PS4 controllers.In addition to the charge time it comes with the primary features you want of a controller (motion sensing and HD rumble pack).  As far as features go it does lack an audio port which is a pretty big omission.  If the rest of the controller wasn't so awesome I would dock a star for this omission.It feels great in the hand.  If anyone remembers the WaveBird controller this feels like it's genetically gifted sibling.  No fatigue using this controller.  Or a more comfortable XB 360 controller (which I also liked).While the PS4 is the worst controller I've used for durability (already have 5+ mostly because of the left analog stick) the Switch Pro controller appears (at least so far) to be the most durable controller I have.  Granted the PS4 controller is the only controller I've had an issue with, the Switch Pro controller still feels more durable than the PS4 controller by a sizeable margin.",
Nintendo USB Switch Pro Controller,5.0,You need to own one to preserve your Joy-Cons,"Reviewed in the United States on March 19, 2018",Color: Black | Edition: Single,True,"Was on the fence about buying a pro controller but saw a YouTube video about people’s joy-cons wearing down from sliding them on and off the Switch. Apparently the button you push in has a raised peg and sliding it on and off the metal rails of the Switch so many times wears it down and your joy-cons can slide off dropping your Switch. So I had originally opted for a second set of joy-cons instead of a pro controller so one set of joy-cons for now on will be attached to my Switch and the other set will not go back on the grip but used as two controllers sideways and I bought the pro controller so I had a controller to game on titles that need that many buttons like Zelda Breath of the Wild. The second set of joy cons charge on a slide in slide out charging dock, that don’t click into place to damage that peg connected to Joy-Con release button. The first set stays attached to my Switch and charges in the dock attached to the Switch. Mind you I know I will have to remove Joy-Cons to play for more than three people but this solution of one pro controller and two sets of Joy-Cons greatly reduces the Switching involved to wear down my Joy-Cons. By the way I’ve been playing the Switch pro controller for 4 days now about 3-5 hours a day and as of this post I still have a almost full charge, although I don’t see any drop off in battery charge icon, but it should have at least gone down a drop but if I had to estimate I’d say it’s still full charged.

The issue I have is either the left thumb-stick or the right trigger burned out on each one I received within a few weeks! I also had serious drifting on the controller with the thumb-stick issues. I just don’t understand how these controllers can sell for the price they do and then consistently under-deliver. I really want to like it and give it a good review, but it’s so hard after the experience I have had.The main reason I have kept my recent one is because I originally purchased a mount for the switch that is specifically designed for the pro controller. I love the mount so much that I’m forcing myself to hang on to the pro controller.Other than the issues I have mentioned, I will say that the buttons feel decent (when they work). I purchased rubber vinyls to go over the grips and buttons which definitely helped make the controller feel better. I would recommend these vinyls if your hands sweat. The natural controller grips made my hands sweat more than normal, which the vinyls helped cut down considerably.I love Nintendo and the switch but Nintendo has some serious quality control to do on their pro controllers and joy-cons. I understand controllers don’t last forever but when they are $60 and burn-out in under a month from just an average gamer, then that’s a problem for me.",

The long battery life is splendid and it feels amazing to not have to stop playing on one of my few free days for a while so my controller charges because I can literally play all damn day without needing to hook up the usb. It's super comfortable, has a nice weight to it, and I love the d-pad on this (all the buttons feel good, but the dpad gets a special mention). It kind of reminds me of the Xbone d-pad, it's quite satisfying and I have a feeling it'd lend itself very well to any future fighters the Switch might get. And yes, it has the fancy rumble just like the joy-cons do and it feels just as nice here.I initially didn't see the need in a separate controller for my Switch, but after my left joy-con started getting the desync issue I finally caved and ordered one. Nintendo was likely to wipe my Switch during the repair and I was not too thrilled at the idea of buying a whole new set of joy-cons. I figured if the left one worked great still attached to the screen when I played it portable, why not just leave the joycons attached 24/7 and just get the Pro and never worry about syncing issues again. I'm very glad that I did because this makes long gaming sessions 10x better.Also special shout out to the slick design on this because it looks super cool.",6 people found this helpful

I love playing the Zelda games.The Joy controls took a little getting used to. I don't hate them but I don't love them either. I definitely did not want a corded controller, so the Pro A or Horipad wasn't an option (I think that is what they are called) so I just got used to the Joy con controls. My husband has really big hands so he really has a difficult time playing with the Joy Cons. He doesn't play the Switch that often so it wasn't a big deal. I didn't realize the Pro Controller had come out until recently but I didn't really want to spend the money at the time. However, I just saw that it was on sale after I bought ""Let's go Eevee"" so I hit the buy it now button and I am really glad I did!!!!  The controller is set just like a pair of Joy Cons so no trying to remember a new pattern. It fits very comfortable in my hands and my husband's hands. Similar in design as the Xbox and PlayStation controls (see photos for comparison) It has a more rounded feel opposed to the Joy Cons. It feels durable and the battery lasts...I played for two days, all day, while my foot was in a cast and it didn't die on me.So far I have played with it on BOTW, Mario Cart 8 and Fortnite. It is not compatible with Let's go Eevee, but there is the Pokeball plus for that.

Nintendo USB Switch Pro Controller,4.0,Fantastic controller,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on April 18, 2017",Color: Black | Edition: Single,True,"This is a great controller.Currently my favorite controller is the Xbox One controller and I drew a few comparisons to it. This controller comes incredibly close in design to it and I find it very comfortable to hold, though not quite as ergonomic as the Xbox One controller, at least for me. I think so far it has earned a place as my second favorite controller. The buttons are large and responsive. The analog stick is very smooth. The d-pad isn't perfect but it suits my needs (see below.)Hooking it up to the Switch has proved easy and here I have no complaints. I only have Breath of the Wild and Shovel Knight so far and it excels at those games. I prefer it to the joycons due to comfort, and if you're planning on mostly playing in docked mode this is a superior controller. I recommend getting this over getting another set of joycons.Now, for the nontraditional. I have various Raspberry Pis set up throughout my house. It pairs up with it via Bluetooth pretty easily, though reconnecting can sometimes be a pain, I keep a wired controller hooked up at all times for these occasions. Usually if I pair it to the Switch and then try to go back to the Retropie I need to delete it's profile and re-pair. A minor annoyance, but it wasn't designed for this purpose obviously. That said, it plays classic games incredibly smooth.  The d-pad works pretty well, though after turning on the analog stick option it is surprisingly smooth for these old games.  I'm thinking when Nintendo finally releases the virtual console for the Switch this controller will work fantastic for their older titles.I knocked a star off because $70 is just a bit too steep in my opinion.",4 people found this helpful

I was so used to playing with joycons after a year of only using them. They were very comfortable as a controller in their own right, with or without the shell. I still want to get the joycons repaired or replaced someday when I get more multiplayer games/It took me a day to acclimate to the new controller, but it already feels just as, if not more comfortable than the joycons in the joycon shell. It's heavier but not uncomfortably so, it's comfortable to grip for a few hours of gameplay. Most of the buttons have decent feedback. The battery seems to be almost as good as the joycons were, I got mine last week and still haven't had to charge it since the first day.If I had any complaints, it's that the home menu and snapshot buttons are in an awkward location and don't have any good feedback, as they don't protrude out at all. I used to be able to take a video recording in the middle of a Splatoon game without getting pulled out of the action, but now it feels like I have to stop the action to reach the button.EDIT: Just so you know... it turns out Pro Controllers are not immune to drift. I've got some pretty irritating drift that comes and goes.I still say buying one of these is better than buying any more of those stupid defective joycons. You only require joycons for what, one game? A bad remake of an old pokemon game nobody asked for?

While the controller is fine, you can easily get other wireless ones for cheaper, and there is enough of them on the market to allow you to choose which drawback(s), if any, you want. The main benefit to buying this controller specifically is because of the name and the official licensing. But that really isn't worth the up-to 100% higher price, as my experience is telling me that there is nothing special, even in quality or durability. I have 4 distinct controllers, and my Pro Controller has had no more or less problems than the others. In my opinion, it doesn't feel as great to hold, unless you like heavy ones, and the motion control function is used in nothing that you'd rather use the joy-cons for.If you just want to not use the base joy-cons, do your research into other controllers first. Getting a decent wired controller for $15-$20 is great if you're looking for a budget (they usually use even less electricity because of lack of battery if you're that cost efficient), and lots have long enough cables for reach to not be an issue.When your controller eventually wears down, if you make the right choice of controller, it's cheaper overall to buy a different one. This Pro Controller might last maybe 10%-20% longer, but if it costs 15%-100% more, it's just so much more cost efficient to choose third-party controllers.",4 people found this helpful

Nintendo USB Switch Pro Controller,4.0,so I had plenty of time with the Joy Cons in different configurations,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on February 7, 2018",Color: Black | Edition: Single,True,"I waited a few weeks to order this, so I had plenty of time with the Joy Cons in different configurations.  But for games like Zelda: Breath of the Wild I found the Joy Cons attached to the default dumb controller attachment that comes with the Switch to be a little wanting.  My hands are a bit larger, so it's very nice to have a larger full controller to work with.One thing I did experience, the first time I sync'd the controller to my Switch I did have some small instances where the controllers tilt functionality was hesitant or laggy. (Example: When using my bow in BotW, it just didn't want to fine tune my targeting by tilting the controller.)  But it seemed to correct itself after only a few minutes of use and I've never experienced the issue again.It also holds a charge for a fairly long time.  I can go a number of days with using the controller an hour or two a day between charging.  However, I cannot detail exactly how many hours of use.  I simply decide that it's been a few days and I plug it in again between uses.If you use amiibos, there seems to be a sweet spot on the controller that can be a pain to find initially. It's not necessarily obvious on where that is. But once you find it and get used to it, then scanning your amiibos goes quicklyOverall it's a very solid controller.  I'm glad I bought one.",2 people found this helpful
Nintendo USB Switch Pro Controller,5.0,So far so good,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on May 8, 2022",Color: Black | Edition: Single,True,"I'm so glad I got the pro controller. Smooth movement, easy grip. This is so much more comfortable to use than the joycons, though the joycons are pretty good too.

Nintendo USB Switch Pro Controller,5.0,Fells a bit more traditional like an Xbox or PS controller,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on December 30, 2017",Color: Black | Edition: Single,True,"Fells a bit more traditional like an Xbox or PS controller.  The joycon seems a bit too easy to click the joystick down on accident while in the heat of battle that was the main reason I got this controller and for a bit more comfort.  The only problem I have with button layout is the + key is close to the Home key and the - is close to the capture button and it can be easy to confuse them or not feel comfortably certain you're gonna hit the right one while playing.  This is minor though as ur usually looking to pause anyway when going for those buttons and if u hit the wrong one it isn't terrible, also u get better as u use it I'm sure.  The joysticks have a lot of room for play yet don't seem to activate untill you've moved them about 50% towards the direction you're going.  Then the last 50% is where u have the control to manage speed.  I.E. if youre trying to walk slowly it feels like you have to move the joystick farther than you should have to before walking begins which leaves less room for control in the stride between walking and running.  This may be fixable in some sensitivity settings I'll have to play around.  Overall though great controller it feels much better playing Zelda with this over the joycon (which is decent itself with the grips)",4 people found this helpful

Figured I’d buy the pro controller. I find that that the sticks are much looser on the pro-controller. It’s taken me a bit to get used to it.

Nintendo USB Switch Pro Controller,5.0,Nice optional? accessory,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on November 17, 2017",Color: Black | Edition: Single,True,"Mama Mia, it'sa good. I like.Price is too high, but I got a deal on a refurbished one. Lasts a good while, several days on a charge for me. Up to a week, even with some heavy play. Nintendo put some thought into this, it's definitely quality like all of their other products. Very comfortable, comparable to a GameCube controller, which has always been my favourite, but with the motion abilities of a Wiimote.While I wouldn't say it's ABSOLUTELY necessary to have one of these for single player games, it sure makes lengthier play more comfortable and gives you the option to switch between charging this and switching to the joy-con and vice versa, if needed. I rarely need to, though. The battery is much longer lasting than the Ps4's dual-shock. (I suspect it's the lighting and possibly touchpad, speaker and maybe even powering a headset that also drains more.) What more can I say? Everything about it is A+ quality, except maybe the d-pad. It's a little...hmm... imprecise. The way the buttons are separated on the actual joy-con and comparatively, the Ps4 controller makes it easier to not accidentally hit something slightly the wrong way, say northwest-ish, instead of just straight north. I find myself accidentally triggering the wrong thing a tad more often on this controller compared to the joy-con. Otherwise, if you can snag a good deal, this is very nice... while making Nintendo a lot of cash--I mean, supporting them.",8 people found this helpful

Nintendo USB Switch Pro Controller,5.0,A very comfortable and intuitive controller,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on April 14, 2018",Color: Black | Edition: Single,True,"I have been a Nintendo Switch owner for almost a year, and while I love the joy-con controller and grip overall, sometimes I prefer a more reliable and ""traditional"" controller.  I finally picked this controller up on amazon this week.  I love it.  This is one of the most comfortable controllers I have ever used, which increases the enjoyment of my Switch games even more.  The battery life is good, the layout makes sense, and it has built in motion-sensors for gyro-scope aiming, which comes in handy for games like ""Splatoon 2"" and ""Zelda: Breath of the Wild.""  The only major downside to this controller is that the button layout for the ""pause"" and ""home"" buttons took a while to get used to, partially since the color scheme can make the buttons look similar.  Other than that, I have no real issues with this controller; the battery life is good, and the controller itself is very comfortable, maybe matching the Gamecube controller as my favorite Nintendo controller.  I would recommend picking this controller up for your switch.  I spent months playing hours of Zelda: Breath of the Wild but worried about the stability of the controller I was using to some extent.  Now I can comfortably sit back and play Breath of the Wild for even more hours on end with a controller that feels great!  The controller is a little pricey, but more than worth it.  So pick it up, and enjoy many hours of fun and comfortable gaming!Peace,Dana",42 people found this helpful

Nintendo USB Switch Pro Controller,4.0,Way better than holding a joycon in each hand,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on June 20, 2018",Color: Black | Edition: Single,True,"The pro controller is very good as far as controllers go. Of course the layout is very similar to an XBox controller, which I always found a let-down considering the GameCube controller was so uniquely Nintendo and also very comfortable and effective. That said, all 4 shoulder buttons are sized well and spaced out well; the trigger action on ZR and ZL are better than the PS4 and XBox controllers, in my opinion, because they provide the right amount of spring -- neither too much nor too little tension, which is what I prefer for shooters.I have 3 critiques. First, the A, B, X, and, Y buttons feel so cheap. They look generic, and there's something about how they feel when you press them that comes off as preschool-toyish. They're not terrible, but it's something I always notice. Second, the ""rumble"" feature is more like a stronger version of a cell phone's vibrator. It's just a generic, flat, buzzing feeling. Compare that to the PS4 rumble where it feels like some creature is crawling around inside your controller. Sometimes it's so jarring that I look down at the controller to see what's going on. I don't know what Sony's mechanism is, but it's more effective than Nintendo's. Third, naturally, is the price 😱 Nothing to say about that that hasn't already been said.If you're low on cash but still want a Switch, you'll be fine without the pro controller. I definitely recommend picking one up at some point, though. I might actually buy a second one soon.",

Nintendo USB Switch Pro Controller,5.0,Amazing General-Purpose Controller,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on June 27, 2019",Color: Black | Edition: Single,True,"The Switch Pro controller is an amalgamation of designs such as the Xbox 360 controller and the Dualshock 2. Having an outer ring, the analog sticks feel similar to the Dualshock 4's as well. The buttons are flat, as opposed to the convex buttons on microsoft controllers, which makes this more comfortable for me to press repeatedly. The back buttons are digital instead of triggers, which makes it more suitable to instant actions. I think this is the ideal controller for Bayonetta, and games like it.The D-Pad is outstanding given how generic in application this controller is. It is very slightly elevated in the center, meaning the hat switch is easy to rock back and forth. It doesn't hurt my thumb very much compared to a lot of previous Nintendo designs, but you may develop a callus if playing fighting games frequently.The controller's large button design can make it feel a bit clunky with some games, particularly in comparsion to playstation controllers. The placement of the D-Pad also is a bit unfortunate for games where you might want to use a claw grip on the left hand. Overall, this is a passable current generation controller to use when your switch is docked, certainly an improvement over joycons.",

Comfortable grip for long play sessions, responsive buttons, comfortable sticks. As all controllers however I have my gripes. The D-pad, although far better than the buttons on a Joy-Con, is not the best Nintendo has ever put on a controller. This disappoints me a lot, I've owned many Nintendo systems and their D-pads have always been the best in the industry so to see this decline is a personal gripe I can't help but share. I do prefer triggers with feedback, but you won't miss much with the simple button like design on this. The biggest merit of the Pro Controller is the built in gyro, playing shooters is a far far better thing with this gyro enhanced aiming. Don't believe me? Play Splatoon 2 with and without it. Although awkward as you get your berrings, it will soon become natural and you'll find yourself unable to shake the habit of expecting all controllers you use to react to your subtle hand motions.Good controller, would recommend.",

A gamer friend chided me, telling me I'd eventually get the Pro Controller.I got a Mayflash NS adapter and tried syncing my XBox One controller and Wii U Pro Controller to the Switch.  It worked, but the controllers either suffered from large analog stick deadzones, and/or incorrect neutral point settings on the analog sticks. In frustration I shelved the adapter and just used the Switch's side controllers with the included controller bracket.I have large hands so the Switch's side controllers were awkward to use.  After about a week, I caved in and got this Pro Controller.As the same friend said:  ""Nintendo sure knows how to make a good controller"".  The fit, finish, and battery life of this controller is AWESOME.  I've been binge playing Payday 2 with said friend plus another friend and even during long weekend gaming sessions, my hands aren't sore or cramped thanks to this controller's ergonomics.So is the price of this controller justifiable? In my case.... It was.  But I gritted my teeth as I placed the order here on Amazon.  As I've said in the past, Nintendo sure knows how to get me to open my wallet.

For a long while I simply used third-party controllers, and they'd work well enough for me for the games I played.  Now that I've finally bitten the bullet and gotten an official controller though, I have to say there is absolutely no comparison.  Better hand feel, better responsiveness, perfectly balanced button sensitivity (i.e. they're plenty sensitive enough for quick response when pressed, but not so sensitive that they'd be accidentally triggered when you're just resting your fingers on them, as was a problem with one of the third-party controllers I tried).

It fits well in your hand, it functions almost perfectly (the d-pad is below average, but not awful, better than og gc controllers), has a long battery life (it hasn’t run out on me since I bough it), and has seemingly no input delay. So why don’t I give it 5 stars? Because there are a bunch of tiny things I have gripes with that don’t apply to 99% of games. I think that the tops of the control sticks are too wide, but I enjoy the c-nub that comes on the gc controllers that a lot of people dislike. I like to slide my fingers over the face buttons when mashing our of grabs in smash, and these buttons roll a little to much for my liking. The fact that the sticks also don’t have notches are good in some scenarios but bad in others (an example is when trying to do macro wavebounce neutral specials in smash; it’s harder to do them bc of the lack of notches, but much it’s easier to play shooter games like warframe and splatoon). The point I’m trying to make is that, if you’re not me, you won’t have any problems with this controller at all, other than the d-pad being bad.",

This is technically compatible with PC but you will have to use it wirelessly, and due to some odd bug the gyro glitches out the DirectInput controls if you have this enabled in Steam... so you have to manually choose between DirectInput OR steam, can't do both at the same time, with that said you'll still want to have an XBOX controller on hand for the occasional PC game where you find yourself wanting a controller.

I sent it back to Nintendo under warranty thinking it was a fluke and bought another one while it was being repaired.

I opened up the case, blew out the electronics and it worked for a little bit but then the problem came back, even though I kept the joystick top clean.

Flawless connectivity with the switch and ergonomics to make you feel right at home on the go makes this a must buy for your switch. My only complaint is I wish this had a BYOB “bring your own battery” option. I’m not a fan of having an internal battery that once it fails, I’ll have to buy a whole new controller. I’ve noticed after it sits for a week the battery will be drained by the time I pull it out again. I would be much happier to just pull the batteries if I plan on letting it sit for a bit.",

Whether your hands are on the rather small size or your 7 feet tall, this controller will optimize your switch experience. Definitely more comfortable than those small Joycons!-Increased Functionality. the well designed controller, addition of a REAL D-pad is definetly an obvious bonus. The buttons are very responsive.

This controller paired with the Fixture S1 has allowed me to play my switch anywhere, anytime!

Overall, the controller feels very sturdy and comfortable.I DID have to send it to Nintendo for repair after it wouldn't turn on or charge, but the replacement they sent me has been working perfectly. I don't really hold this against them though, because a bad unit every now and then happens and doesn't speak to the overall quality and reliability.",

I have arthritis and cannot play on most controllers very long at all & this controller was a huge change for me, because now I can actually play video games for more than 20 minutes at a time again without pain. I like that you can also use it on PC for Steam games. I had some issues with mine where the plastic hand grips did not line up flush with the controller body and I had to return a few and do a Nintendo repair to finally get one that didn't have that issue, but that wasn't a serious issue and I think it's just that I really hate the feel of a noticeable edge on my hands. The controller does have an issue with the D pad sometimes registering the wrong inputs. I never noticed this problem until Tetris 99. For games like that or 2D platformers that require a lot of precise D pad inputs it is not the best controller. But for 3D games it works well.

Nintendo USB Switch Pro Controller,5.0,Feels Right in Your Hands!,"Reviewed in the United States on November 28, 2017",Color: Black | Edition: Single,True,"I figured I'd be happy with the stock Joy Con controllers in the handle.  My hands are smaller than most gamers, so it was relatively comfortable for me to use them, until I tried to play Mario Kart with my brother with the individual Joy Cons...  Even my smaller hands aren't tiny enough to work them comfortably, and they aren't evenly matched since the buttons are sort of off kilter as a pair.I needed a second controller if I wanted to play properly with someone else.  Enter this beauty!  The Pro Controller instantly has a great feel right out of the box, with a nice sure weight that comes from its rumble pack and internal battery.  It works great if you have problems using the smaller Joy Con controller in its handle accessory.  The controller charges relatively quick, and pairing is easy with the console once you've plugged the charge cable into the Switch base at least once.My only beef with it is unless you have a special case that has room for a pro controller, its a pain in the butt to transport/travel with.  Anything that touches any button or joy stick will activate it and kill the battery in it.  I don't plan on traveling with it much, so for a home controller, it works perfect!

Nintendo USB Switch Pro Controller,5.0,A Joy to Use,"Reviewed in the United States on May 10, 2017",Color: Black | Edition: Single,True,"When I first unwrapped the Pro Controller and held it I was astounded at how *good* it felt to hold it. I wouldn't have thought a controller could feel better than an Xbox 360 controller, but Nintendo's newest (and rather pricey) Pro Controller definitely surpasses it. I actually just pick it up at random, without playing a game, to marvel at the quality and amazing feel. Weird, I know.The design feels solid without too much weight, the handles have a comfortable grippy material pleasant to the touch, and the buttons and control sticks are larger than the Joy-Con's buttons and sticks. The good ol' Nintendo d-pad is nice to have as well.The cost certainly deterred me. When an extra DualShock 4 or Xbox One controller costs around $25 less (or $10 more if you design our own at Xbox Design Lab), this seemed a bit much. However, after feeling it in hand, playing with it and knowing there's a fair bit of tech in there compared to others, I've found it to be a good investment for myself and can recommend it to anyone who will be playing their Switch docked or with local multiplayer. For me it is definitely worth the extra time working to save up for it.""It's dangerous to go alone! Take this.""",
Nintendo USB Switch Pro Controller,2.0,Fails early due to poor quality control or workmanship!,"Reviewed in the United States on May 3, 2022",Color: Black | Edition: Single,True,"I’m over 60 but have been playing video games since the 1980s and found BOTW alone to be worth the the price of a Switch console. I bought and used this controller for that game for about 3 months and stopped playing for about 10 months. Picked up the Pro controller after a full charge and all was good for about a week. Now the controller won’t charge the perfectly good battery. I have to take the controller apart and charge the battery in an off brand controller that works fine and is older than the Nintendo controller.  Between all the joystick failures I’ve heard about from my grandkids along with this charging failure I conclude this product is poorly made and should not be priced this high with only a 90 day warranty. My advice is stay away from the overpriced Nintendo controller unless you need Amiibo or other special features.  Failure after such a small amount of usage by an adult is proof it is the product’s fault and not abuse by kids.  Very disappointing, Nintendo!  I’ve owned every console since the original NES (except Wii U) and this is the first terrible product I’ve owned from Nintendo. I will buy an off brand wireless to replace this failed garbage one.  Note to others: Be sure the off brand model can turn on the console… made that mistake before buying this “mistake” last year.",
Nintendo USB Switch Pro Controller,5.0,Great switch controller,"Reviewed in the United States on May 4, 2021",Color: Black | Edition: Single,True,"The controller is great for couch sessions. I got sick of sliding off the joy cons whenever I docked the switch, so this was a great upgrade. It functions perfectly and synced with my switch out of the box. The only negative I would say is that I tried to use it as a pc controller and had some issues pairing it to my Windows desktop. However once I did, it worked flawlessly. Although I then had some issues pairing it back to my switch. All in all if you plan on using this as a dedicated switch controller you can't go wrong.

Yeah it's a bit more expensive that a PS4 or Xbox One controller but I believe it's worth it.Pros-Feels awesome in the hand-It's super easy to connect to the Switch-Comes with HD rumble and NFC reader for amiibos-Battery life is outstanding. Bought this a week ago and still haven't had the need to charge it. (Advertised battery life is 40 hours or so)-Can be used for gaming in the Switch, PC and even mobiles phones.Cons- The left and right triggers are not analog, meaning that using the control for racing games is not optimal in the PC- Setting the control for PC gaming  can be a bit tricky and if your PC does not have a bluetooth adapter then you won't be able to use it. The included USB-C cable only brings in power and not data, so the only way to connect the controller to a PC is via bluetooth.Overall this is a great controller and I'm really happy with my purchase.

Its understated clear/black finish belies its immensely satisfying buttons, sticks, and D-pad; additionally, button placement feels extremely natural, and the impeccable build quality will ensure that this controller will stand up to many long gaming sessions. Even with motion control, an NFC sensor, and HD Rumble, it lasts an amazing 40 hours on a single charge - half of what the Wii U Pro Controller did, but still more than the DualShock 4 and the Xbox One controller combined. The Pro Controller also works natively on Windows PCs via USB or Bluetooth, and is even compatible with Steam if the user participates in the Steam Client Beta. My only real gripe is that the HD Rumble in this controller isn't quite as pronounced as that in the Joy-Cons, but I chalk that up to the function having to travel through denser plastics, so it's really more of a nitpick than anything.

It’s a grey market good.Also, either Nintendo’s QC is garbage or the controller I got was used or refurbished.  Plastic stress and crack marks tell me that it had been used previously.  Also in the pics I uploaded, it was also disassembled before.  There’s pry marks on the left grip.Other then those annoy problems, the controller works fine.

Big to hold, nice solid responsive buttons.- DEFINITELY a step up from split joycons as you probably could have guessed. You can play multiplayer games with both joycons (I use them without grips), and the pro controller. Also, you can count the pro controller as a 3rd controller if two others use split joycons. So over all, an additional controller.These are the key reasons why I think the controller is worth the investment.Edit:I forgot to mention a very huge plus:The Pro controller pairs with the System as smoothly as the Joycons.

The buttons are big and comfortable, the controller sits nicely in the hand, the triggers are designed really well so they feel great and are natural to rest your fingers on.I know the controller is pricey, but if you play the Switch a fair bit at home docked, then its worth it.

Nintendo USB Switch Pro Controller,4.0,I love this controller... but,"Reviewed in the United States on September 6, 2020",Color: Black | Edition: Single,True,"As much as I love the Nintendo pro controllers, the one I ordered came flawed. When mine arrived, I noticed it suffered from a condition labeled by the Switch community as ‘drift’, more commonly associated with the joycons. If you don’t know, what this means is my left joystick, at a neutral position, will slightly drift to the left without a physical input. This is kinda annoying, but now I’ve had mine for almost half a year, and it hasn’t bothered me much since. There’s no fix to this thats ‘user friendly’, since an at home way of fixing it requires disassembling the controller and messing around with the internal electronics.I’m ordering another one in time for xmas for my girlfriend, but know your controller may arrive with drift.",
Nintendo USB Switch Pro Controller,4.0,Best Nintendo controller in decades,"Reviewed in the United States on May 2, 2017",Color: Black | Edition: Single,True,"This is a must have for the Switch. Gaming is so much easier with the pro controller than with the LR Joy Cons that come with the system (which I find buggy). If you are a fan of the PS 4 controller, you will love the Switch's Pro. Very similar. Allows for a nice grip and easy game playing. While everyone loved the Wii's motion censored controller, I often found i buggy and that it wouldn't synchronize well. There were also so many different ways to use it that it wasn't simple enough for me. I also prefer two handed game play. The Switch's Pro Controller allows both hands on one controller, and since it isn't a motion controller like, the Wii, and doesn't have two components to it, like the Switch's Joy, you don't have the issues of synching and connectivity. It's an intuitive controller to use, as well. You don't have to ""think"" while using it.Only reason I'm docking a star is because of the price. At $69.99 I find it really expensive, especially given how poorly the Joy Cons work for games like MARIO Kart. You will want two Pros if you have that game. But that is a $140 additional investment, not to mention tax.",

I have tried different outlets between the 2 ports. The cables that came with the switch and the controller were tried, it appears that the port of the controller is busted but I dont know how it could be as I can not see any damage to it. The cables power my other devices fine as well and no 3rd party equipment were used. I honestly DO NOT want to buy another one at the current price point.

Nintendo USB Switch Pro Controller,5.0,Comfy controller with an amazing battery life,"Reviewed in the United States on June 19, 2019",Color: Black | Edition: Single,True,"This is the official brand pro controller for the Nintendo Switch. In layout, it is very similar to an Xbox 360/One controller, with the exception of the ABXY buttons being changed around a bit. Ergonomically, it is very comfortable to hold, which is surprising since I have very small hands. However, the comfort of a controller is very subjective, so the only real way you will know is if you hold one for yourself. The controller is very easy to connect to the Nintendo Switch console or a PC and has a great wireless range. The controller includes a lithium-ion battery that has a killer battery life of 40 hours, which is so long that sometimes I forget I even have to charge this thing and get shocked when a low battery warning shows up on the screen. The $70 MSRP of the controller seems very steep, but for the comfort, battery life, gyro, and NFC reader, it is worthwhile if you play your Switch a lot. Since it's $50 rn, I would recommend it even more.",

It took me many headache inducing hours of downloading drivers, installing different programs, switching to different USB wires and ports, and I only got it to work by seemingly random chance.

The corded ones buttons don't have smooth action and has no motion control and you need the motion in some games.

My Switch will be used at home, connected to my tv, 99% of the time. I found the included Joycon controller, to be a little small for my hands, so i bought the Pro. Right off the bat, you notice how much more comfortable it is to hold for extended periods of time, over the joycons. The inclusion of a proper D-Pad, is also a plus, as i found the 4 buttons on the joycon that act as the D-Pad, just felt weird, when i tried to use what should've been a D-Pad. The buttons and thumbsticks, just seem to react better overall. The battery life of the Pro, is really long. Somewhere around 40 hours, off of 1 charge. I only own Zelda BOTW so far, so i can't comment on the rumble feature, as Zelda barely uses it, and i also can't comment on the built in Amiibo scanner, as i have yet to use it, since i don't have any Amiibo. In the end, if you game mostly at home like myself, definitely get yourself the Pro controller, for extended periods of play.",

I thought the rumble would be a little stronger but it's at the same power as the joycons, but the rumble still feel a little weaker because the pro contoller shell is thicker than the joycons, but the controller does have HD rumble, NFC, motion controls, etc. This controller is easily one of my top 5 controllers.

Nintendo USB Switch Pro Controller,1.0,TRASH-Not For Incremental Movements,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on August 8, 2020",Color: Black | Edition: Single,True,"Is an okay controller and takes some getting used to for certain games. Not recommended for incremental movements for games that require motion detail, unless you're willing to spend extra time practicing for that specific game or unless the game has that all movement where you can physically direct the controller to position on screen. Once you know how to work it, it's okay; the joysticks are kinda stiff meaning they either go one way or the other and you can't move just right in a smooth, slow motion if you need to do it quickly like a computer mouse. Does last a long time on one charge which is a huge plus.Update:Pros - Charge lasts a long time, durability is great (but I mean it has to be, it's supposed to take a beating if it's a pro controller I assume)Cons - Very stiff and underdeveloped joy sticks. This is a major downside for me because my hands are getting more of a workout than they should and I have averaged sized hands. Incremental movements are a must in gaming and it makes it extremely hard when you are more focusing on disciplining the movement of your had to control the joy stick than the actual game itself. It's really more for the use of playing those Nintendo classic games where input is forgiving and not for more aggressive high action movement games such as FPS and BR games. I'm bored with Nintendo classics, make a true pro controller.Update 08/05/21:As you start gaming on a consistent basis and start tensing in the hands due to concentration and frustration, you'll start to notice the bulk of the controller and the placement of the left joystick is not conducive or practical for gaming and causes your hands to feel uncomfortable everytime you pick up the controller; it will start to feel unnatural to hold. Honestly, now that I put it all together,  Nintendo used this as a gimmick to just increase sales, there really isn't a good reason to spend this amount of money on a controller like this. You'll basically be overpaying for the battery life and that's it.Update: It's really a trash controller, marketed for those that really don't game and wouldn't know any better. Drift galore, but cleaning can kinda fix that. Controller died out completely a week ago and nothing can fix it. Lasted 4 years with the switch collecting dust for majority of the time; it should still be usable. I tried pairing again (the reset button at the top), tried updating...essentially came to the conclusion it's literally garbage now. I guess 4 years is better than ps5 dualsense controller's 1 year. Input lag/responsiveness very noticeable on this controller. Not sure if I mentioned before, but this really started to get on my nerves after a while. Have buyer's remorse with both the switch and it's so called ""pro"" controller lmao more like slow junk. After my ps5 purchase, the switch will be collecting more dust or I'll give it away to my baby cousins; that is if they'll even want and use it.",One person found this helpful
Nintendo USB Switch Pro Controller,4.0,A 5 star controller that gets dinged just for price,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on March 13, 2018",Color: Black | Edition: Single,True,"Let me say right away that this thing is 5 stars for every single reason other than price. I only put it at 4 because the price point for this thing is so ridiculous at $70. It honestly feels better in the hand than my PS4 controller does (the handles are a bit straighter and narrower) and Nintendo really needs to think about including one of these with the console. The battery in it is also phenomenal, as a single charge seems to last for weeks of standby and play. It's silly that you have to buy this thing in the first place, and sadly because of it's high price, I feel that few will get to experience the joy of playing with this. It really made my Switch feel more like a proper home console than the Joy Con did. I actually play it way more on the TV now than I did previously, and it's made me download a lot more of the indie games to play on the TV as well. Overall it's fantastic and I would say every switch owner really deserves one; it's unfortunate Nintendo priced it so very few will be willing to shell out the money for it.",5 people found this helpful
Nintendo USB Switch Pro Controller,5.0,Excellent controller for the Switch,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on November 12, 2018",Color: Black | Edition: Single,True,"I have big hands, so the Joy-Con controllers that come with the Switch are difficult for me to use (and they tend to lose sync every so often, which can interrupt games).  The Pro Controller is almost exactly the same size as an Xbox One controller and feels just as comfortable to me, the sticks and buttons are good quality, the battery life is great, and it charges quickly.  And I have not lost sync with this controller once yet.  I received a second Pro Controller as a gift, and it works just as well, giving me a lot of flexibility.The only complaint I have with this controller has less to do with the controller itself and more with how Nintendo designed some of its games to work with the Joy-Cons.  Super Mario Odyssey, for example, has a few specific moves that can only be performed on the Joy-Cons because they require the Joy-Cons to move independently, which you can't do with the Pro Controller.  Thankfully, none of these things actually make the games hard to play.",
Nintendo USB Switch Pro Controller,4.0,Nearly Perfect,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on January 26, 2019",Color: Black | Edition: Single,True,"The Switch Pro controller is an amazing controller. I like everything about it, from the buttons to the analogue sticks. The HD rumble is great, and it's just the right size for my hands. And don't even get me started on the battery life. This thing's battery lasts so long that I often forget it even needs to be charged every once in a while.But I can't give it a full five stars. Reason being that the point where the analogue stick makes contact with the edges of the controller cause some serious abrasion. This has happened to both my pro controllers, and gives the analogue stick endpoints a slight grindy-ness for lack of a better term. It probably won't do anything serious to the controller's longevity, but it makes it lose its ""premium"" feel after about ten hours of use.I would love it if Nintendo offered an ""elite"" option like Microsoft does for the Xbox One. Even if it matched its price of $150, it would guarantee a premium-feeling controller that would maintain its premium feel for hundreds of hours of gameplay.",
Nintendo USB Switch Pro Controller,4.0,A Great Docked-Switch Accessory,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on April 18, 2020",Color: Black | Edition: Single,True,"Over the last few years, Nintendo has been largely absent from the ""Pro"" Controller sphere.  The last Nintendo Pro controller was for the Wii U and with very little use, it didn't last very long.  I had mine for about a year and it stopped working.  It felt cheap and in the end, it was indeed cheaply made.  With the Switch Pro Controller, we finally get a high quality handheld controller.  It feels great in your hands and I would say it's a must-have for docked gaming.  Some complain about the d-pad but I haven't had any issues thus far.  It's a bit expensive but it feels expensive (more so than the last Nintendo Pro controller); there's a certain heft to it. (It's not heavy but it's nicely weighted.)  Highly recommended!",

HD rumble and motion controls work fine and battery life is worlds ahead of the PS4 controller. The D-pad is a step down from typically Nintendo design though, having no ball underneath the center, so every direction can be pushed in at once, which can occasionally cause problems, but I've played a ton of Tetris and shovel Knight with it and it's still pretty solid. The erganomics are stellar though, to be sure. Feels better than any other controller that I can think of and I think the Xbox one S controller is pretty top notch comfort-wise. Also, with the right Bluetooth controller adapter it can be used on the PS3 and aside from the six axis crap not being present it works perfectly. I blasted through a good portion of uncharted with it just to test it. I bought mine used too which I'm normally leery of, but it's really study and I've had no issues at all.

I've had every controller since the NES and the Gamecube and Xbox 360 controllers were always my favorite. This has taken the cake for sure. It sits in your hands very well, all button placements feel appropriate and ergonomic. The weight or heft of the controller is perfect, a little on the heavy side but not enough to fatigue you. Sticks are fantastic, D pad is arguably the best (you may prefer the Sony style, but this is easily second to that if so). It also uses USB C to charge so you can (likely) share the cable with your phone for years to come.Only complaint I have is the price, which when you factor in the battery life, amiibo function, motion controls, is understandable but still hard to swallow when you consider the library for this controller. You'll likely only use it to play Zelda for a long while until other Switch titles start rolling out. You can be crafty and use it on your PC for sure, but it would be nice if Nintendo made it plug-n-play for PC as Microsoft has done.",

The layout feels much less cramped. The sticks feel sturdier and more substantial. The + and - buttons are much easier and more comfortable to access. The only downsides to the pro controller are that it uses standard rumble instead of HD rumble, it doesn't disconnect to operate as two controllers, and it costs an extra sum of money on top of the system itself. But for the amount of playtime you'll get out of it and the comfort it will afford you, it's easily worth the money.

I'd go as far to say this controller is more comfortable than Xbox 1 and ps4 controllers. $70 may seem steep for a controller but let's remember there is an accurate motion sensor built into this. Plus the battery life is incredible, I've read it lasts 40 hours. I've played here and there for 2 weeks and still haven't needed to charge it.The reason I rated it 4 stars is because...well first and foremost, people don't trust 5 star reviews BUT also the controller is not very breathable. I believe it's mostly the material used for the hand-grips. So your hands will get sweaty sometimes.

None of the fixes worked for me. For $70 I expect it to last longer even under a lot of play time. Most reviews fault the left toggle.I bought it after I bought my Switch expressly to play The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. I found the JoyCons awkward for this game. It is a fabulous, sumptuous and gorgeously realized game. However since this started, it has gotten to be more consistent in it's glitch to the 180 position. Link trots along or runs away from monsters, and as soon as I stop him, he does an immediate about face and starts walking off!!! I can't have him walking blithely to his death every time he stops in a dangerous place. I have to keep pushing the toggle back to get him to finally stand still, and it's become ridiculous, so I'm forced to order another if I want to finish the game! He's walked off cliffs, stood up from a crouch to walk away and been peppered with arrows, scared away game, and drawn the attention of enemies all because this left toggle is suddenly massively glitchy. I tried canned air to blow out any dust, but it seems like a part failure.

However, this is my favorite now. It feels much more solid despite how it looks. Everything is in the same general format but for some reason it's easier for me to use. You can even use it with Steam if your PC has bluetooth!There are only a few issues:Sometimes this does not turn off on its own even after disconnecting this from PCThe triggers are binary; you'll still want to stick with the Xbox controllers for games that require a certain amount of ""activation"" (e.g. racing games).The A/B and X/Y buttons are swapped (probably for patent reasons or something) so you will have to configure how the controller works on Steam. If you switch back and forth between the Switch and an Xbox controller, it gets VERY confusing.All in all, this is the controller I like to use for Smash, BOTW, and PC gaming.",

Nintendo USB Switch Pro Controller,5.0,"top quality gamepad, if a bit ugly","Reviewed in the United States on July 11, 2018",Color: Black | Edition: Single,True,"Feels like a quality piece of Nintendo peripheral out of the box.  Links up to the Switch with no issues, with no noticeable intermittency during use in my experience.  The Sony Dual Shock 4 has been my favorite gamepad for a long time, but I'd say this beats it out by a small margin.  The layout is great, and all the buttons and sticks feel very tactile with just the right amount of stiffness.  The rumble that we expect from Nintendo controllers is back as well, and then some.  As for the negatives, in my opinion, the cosmetic design is pretty ugly; it doesn't look like a consumer ready product, and appears more industrial.  But being a ""pro"" controller [whatever that means], maybe this was the marketing intent.  Additionally, for those Steam users out there, apparently Steam is working on native support for this gamepad, so there is some added value in that respect (hopefully Nintendo doesn't get in the way with that...you know how they are).",2 people found this helpful

Long battery life too. And it’s charged fully right out of the gate.I got this controller because my joycons has drifting issues.

Charging is convenient with the same cable I would use for the Switch. Can be used plugged in. After a while of use thumb caps tried to pop off.

It feels great in your hands, and I like the weight of it. It's basically a better-feeling version of the WiiU Pro Controller, for anyone who's used that.  70 dollars for it is way too much though, especially when part of that price tag has to do with it having stuff like 3D rumble. Unfortunately, it's pretty much mandatory if you want to play your Switch locally with friends, or even if you just want to play by yourself on your TV. (The joycons are fine as the tablet's controllers, but they're not great when you disconnect them to play on the TV.)This controller's saving grace is that it connects very easily to a computer, making it great for PC games with full controller support. It would be much more convenient if it was XInput, but oh well.Overall, I'd recommend buying this controller if you have a Switch, especially if you play PC games as well. It isn't the greatest deal in the world, but my friends and I have gotten a lot of use out of it.",4 people found this helpful

The build quality is excellent, and thank goodness Nintendo didn't cheap out and put a stupid micro USB port on this controller. I am really happy I pulled the trigger on this instead of getting a cheaper alternative. While the joycon grip is ok, I think it's worth it to spend $65 to buy this. It comes with a 6 foot USB C to USB A cable so you can charge it with the switch dock. The HD rumble is awesome and so are the motion controls. It has NFC too for amibo but do people even use that feature? So there is lots of tech packed into this hardware and I believe it justifies it's price tag.",

I prefer the shape on the WiiU Pro better but this one actually feels more comfortable to me. They finally offset the analogue joysticks which makes gaming easier. 40hr battery life vs the old at 80hrs is a step back but they use the exact same battery just this one has hd rumble and an nfc reader. 40hrs is still long enough for even a hardcore gamer. You don’t need the joycons to play the switch. I brought my switch screen and this controller to work and played Mario Kart during lunch. Left the joycons at home.

Nintendo USB Switch Pro Controller,5.0,Pleasantly Surprised,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on January 4, 2019",Color: Black | Edition: Single,True,"I originally bought this controller because I hated how difficult it was to play Super Smash on the regular switch controllers. The sticks are too small, and I feel like that whole controller is better suited for portability and smaller hands.The price of one of these controllers is HALF of what it costs to get a second set of Joycon controllers and a grip, so I was a little worried that it was going to feel cheap and unpleasant to hold. Thankfully, this isn't the case.The controller has a wonderful texture to it, and feels great to hold in your hand. The sticks are smooth, and the triggers are WONDERFULLY tactile, some of the best I've felt on a controller. The buttons are also nice and smooth, and have a silent tactile bump at the bottom. The whole controller feels really great, and very premium. I bought a second one for my wife because she liked it so much.",

This is all fixed with the Pro Controller although I only got one so basically my boyfriend and I have to fight for it.I hate that it’s so expensive but it’s also so ’necessary’ so Nintendo just takes all my money and I guess I’m okay with it.

Aside from questionable internal parts quality, my only complaint is the location of the D pad. The left thumb stick and D pad locations should have been swapped. The current D pad location makes it easy for the player to accidentally press diagonal up/right or diagonal up/left, which is the D pad issue people are complaining about. BTW, the controller is $10 more than the MSRP for the PS4 controller, but the PS4 controller does not come with a charge cable.",2 people found this helpful
Nintendo USB Switch Pro Controller,5.0,Perfect addition to an already great gaming system.,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on October 23, 2019",Color: Black | Edition: Single,True,"As much as I love my Switch, it is hard to use the controllers while attached to the system. I bought this because I miss the feeling of a full size controller. It was easy to set up and I have not noticed any lag between the controller and the system. This has an amazing battery life as well. I was shocked that I charged it once and then was able to use it all week with about an hour average per play. The battery was still strong every time that I picked this up to play some games. Extra bonus is that the power cord that comes with this controller will also charge the Switch. That is a huge plus for me because it means having to carry less charging cords when I am on the go.",
Nintendo USB Switch Pro Controller,5.0,Mandatory Purchase For Adults/Gamers,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on April 18, 2018",Color: Black | Edition: Single,True,If you Play games on a regular basis this is a must buy. The Joy Con controllers are outclassed by the Pro controller in every concievable way except for the lack of HD rumble. The fantastic ergonomics will make extended gaming very comfortable and the controller was supported by every game I've played so far (its especially good for shooters). It pairs up even better than the default Joy Cons. It has a good battery life. It has a REAL D-pad and not that nonsense that everyone pretends is a D-pad on the left Joy Con. The analog sticks are also positioned much better than the Joy Cons are when they're connected to either side of the Switch. The triggers aren't the best when compared to the Xbox One and PS4 controllers but that is a nitpick. If you are above the age of 10 and play games as a hobby you NEED this controller. Let your friends and small children play with those Joy Cons.,One person found this helpful

It feels larger than the joycons with the joycon grip. The buttons on the pro controller feel higher quality and are larger than the joycons which is great for games like Splatoon 2 where the ZL and ZR buttons are used frequently. It takes a while to transition from the joycons to the pro controller if you’re used to the joycons alone, but the pro controller becomes natural to use. I just wish it wasn’t so expensive so I can buy a second pro controller for myself. Other than that, this is a great upgrade from the joycons. It has the same features from the joycons like motion controls, NFC for amiibo, snapshot for photo and video, home button, and rumble. It comes with a charger which you can plug it in to your Nintendo Switch to recharge your pro controller.

However, I went with the Pro Controller and haven't regretted it since. I use my Switch docked 70% of the time and this controller makes gaming on it perfect. The build quality is superb, the buttons are responsive and it just feels premium. I've been using it for about 20-30 hours so I'll be sure to make an update around the 1 month mark (which is when it seems the left joystick craps out on a lot of these controllers). If you play a lot of solo games docked, get this controller. The Joy Con + grip is definitely serviceable, but take your game up a notch with the pro especially if you play games like Splatoon 2.

Within 7 months the ""Pro"" controller has developed the phantom joystick drift. I am a light to medium gamer. This product should not have degenerated this quickly. (Heck, I have OEM N64 controllers that accept the joystick input better!) While connectivity issues are non existent and the larger buttons improve the user experience; that's where the positives end. The product has been rendered useless within 7 months and only comes with a 90 day warranty! If you do a quick google search you can confirm this issue is being reported widely in reviews and forums online. Clearly Nintendo is aware of the problem and is offering less than the 1 year warranty that is the industry standard and substituting an initial high quality product with a subpar repair program. It should be criminalized! (Sounds crazy, but the EU is working on it, and why shouldn't we demand products that last?! It's better for the planet!)Nintendo's does offer a repair program that has the potential to be free, but when I sent the JoyCon's in for repair I ended up with poor quality repairs on the left and a replacement in worse condition than I sent in for the right controller. Why bother using the repair program then? I never thought I'd recommend 3rd party manufacturer over Nintendo OEM. The Nintendo brand has lost all cachet for me :(I wish I could recommend this product, but save your money. You are better off looking for a 3rd party controller with a 1 year warranty.

Although expensive, it's necessary for hardcore gaming while at home, due to the Joy-Con device buttons being too small and primarily designed for handheld use instead. Although it's a step down from the previous generation (the Wii U Pro Controller took 4.5 hours to charge and lasted 80 hours total, while the Nintendo Switch Pro Controller takes 6 hours to charge and only lasts 40 hours total), the Switch Pro Controller does have additional features, like Amiibo support, motion controls and HD rumble. The position of the Control Sticks on the Switch Pro Controller actually brings back memories of the Nintendo GameCube Controller, which was designed in a similar way. Perhaps this is Nintendo's way of bringing back the GameCube fans who left for Sony and Microsoft during the Wii and Wii U eras. In any case, I highly recommend it, especially for games like Zelda, Mario Kart Deluxe and Splatoon.",

This doesn't seem like it would be an issue, since you don't usually look at tooltips when you know how to play a game, but it manages to have a subconscious influence that leaves me often pressing the wrong buttons for certain games.

Switch back and forth between this and PS$ or Xbox and it gets even more confusing.

It's expensive, rarely goes on sale, but it is the real thing, not a knock-off like some of the others.

It's very ergonomic, the buttons and sticks are now a proper size for your fingers and feel good, and the build quality is great. Not great? The price. With both PS4 and XB1 controllers going anywhere from $40-50 at time of writing, this thing is at a minimum $30 more expensive for practically no reason. And as far as I can tell, those controllers technically have more features than this controller does (touchpad, headphone jack, big lights, etc), making the price even more disappointing.

The charge it holds is incredible; I didn't know it had amiibo detection capabilities, but that is pretty cool, too.  I also used the C to A cable that comes with it to hook up the switch itself to an external battery pack to add another three hours or so of Zelda play when I was away from the base unit.  I have the xbox One S as well, with those cool white controllers and I love the feel of them, but this is actually a bit of a cut above those.

Using the OpenEmu emulator, during many games the character will not go into a full run forwards, and will go ridiculously fast if I pull back making them go in reverse. I do not notice this with the games on the consoles I’ve played on, so maybe they are able to adjust for the miscalibration while the computer programs just can’t seem to calibrate it totally correctly. My solution has been to switch the controls to the D-pad while playing emulated games.

The gyroscope works really well with Splatoon 2 (global testfire tested).The only thing I can state as a potential weak point (besides my personal preference of top side analog sticks) is that the d-pad is quite firm, and isn't as nice to use as a primary character input as the Wii U Pro Controller's.

If nothing else, it is worth to pick this controller up to have the option of play if you want a more traditional feeling controller over the more innovative and experimental Joy-Cons.

I have normal sized hands but cannot stand how small the joycons are even attached to the holder. Has a great weight to it, D-pad is well made especially when compared to the joycon option. I especially like the feel of the ZL,ZR buttons, they fit the contour of where your fingers would be perfectly. It's a must for a second controller if needed, but it is my go to pad for playing everything, notably Smash Bros. Ultimate where a normal sized controller is more suited for. I find the joycons to feel extremely cheaply made, also evidenced by the rubber tops coming off after only a few months.

Also, when playing smash bros ultimate, ""tilts"" are sooo much easier to pull off with these joysticks versus the joycons. If you're struggling with tilts, this is the way to go controller wise. Though if you want a controller ""purely"" for smash, maybe the gamecube controller is better. But this is preferable to me as it works with almost every game!

When I press left or right on the D-Pad, I would get up instead of right or left. I've used the Input Test on the System Settings to confirm. Now what happens with the D-Pad is if you hold a direction and then shift or roll your thumb perpendicular to that direction the input changes. It also happens when if I press the a direction off center. The issue is the same for all three controllers, I returned the two previous ones. I have to keep this third controller but I am thinking of returning it, I just can't play with the joycons. They are less precise and the Switch Pro Controller is really great for the Breath of Wild. The Pro controller helped me beat so many Lynels in BotW but it also cause me to die in the game. I would be in the middle of a fight with a Silver Lynel and my sword breaks. I press right on the D-Pad to quickly change to another weapon but I get the runes instead. I press two more times and I get the runes both times. Then I die from its AOE blast. It is very annoying when that happens. I don't have the game Puyo Puyo Tetris yet but people on forums have written that's impossible to play with the Pro's D-Pad. I don't think the majority of the people have noticed this problem or maybe they think that they only pressed the wrong button while playing. I want to love this controller but D-Pad issue is a big deal breaker for me. Could it be bad luck and I just got three bad controllers in row?

This, in my opinion of course, is the best controller I have ever had the pleasure of owning and using. Before I purchased this, my xbox elite controller had been my favorite due to the way the controller felt in my hands. But this controller feels way more natural to hold. I literally don't have a single complaint regarding this controller. Wireless is great on it, the battery life lasts for a really long time before having to charge it again, and I also love how large the ABXY buttons are compared to xbox/ps4 controllers. I HIGHLY recommend this controller. I don't usually leave reviews, but for this one I just had to. Bravo on this one Nintendo!",
Nintendo USB Switch Pro Controller,4.0,"Makes gaming easier, not so easy on the thumbs","Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on August 2, 2018",Color: Black | Edition: Single,True,"I believe this is an essential to any Switch gamer that spends a lot of time with the console docked. It increases the ease of control that’s otherwise hindering with the small joy cons, and it lets the joy cons charge for later portable use. I find it especially useful for Mario tennis aces, or any game where the right control stick is used. I find myself accidentally bumping it and messing up my game on the joy cons. My only gripe is that the control sticks have a type of rim around them that hurts if you play hard like me. (I actually got a blister on my thumb after only a few hours of play.) Note: I also have a blue cover on my controller and a control stick cover to alleviate the aforementioned issue, and it seems to have worked.",2 people found this helpful
Nintendo USB Switch Pro Controller,5.0,Favorite controller,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on December 4, 2019",Color: Black | Edition: Single,True,"I really like these controllers. I prefer them over the Joycons. One warning is that they have a known issue. The joysticks will create dust when you use them, and this dust eventually causes drifting. Mine lasted for over a year with so many hours of gameplay I can't really complain, but I also made sure to keep the dust from getting into the controller. I have heard that some people's controllers start drifting in as little as a month. You can also choose to get metal joysticks, which are easy enough to install. This will prevent the dust issue entirely. I give this product 5 stars based on my personal experience.",

Nintendo USB Switch Pro Controller,5.0,Most Comfortable Controller Out There,"Reviewed in the United States on June 17, 2020",Color: Black | Edition: Single,True,This controller is amazing. It feels so good in your hands. The battery life on this controller is insane compared to the PS4 controller. This controller lasts like 20+hours of game play on a single charge. One of the reasons why it's so good is because it does not have an annoying big bright light in the back of it to lower the battery charge as quickly *cough* PS4 *cough*....If you want of a more classical feel controller then get this for your Switch.

I find that I don't have far to push before I'm pushing the stick against the limit of it's movement radius.

The grips are really nice and the feel is clean and button presses are pretty crisp. This controller is very comfortable and surprisingly has the NFC built in for amiibo. The only gripe is that the NFC is in a weird spot and can be a little difficult to trigger. The battery life in this is really good and I've never gone a play session where it's gone dead.

I highly recommend getting a protection plan for this, it would be well worth the money as these controllers are not made well.Update, July 8th 2018:The L2 and the plus button stopped working at the same time. The controller is useless now and is just out of warranty. It was never dropped or thrown once. No longer impressed, and am hesitant to buy any more Nintendo controllers as we've had issues with the joycons too.I am impressed; this is a truly fantastic controller.  It reminds me of the good old original Xbox controller due to it's larger size, joystick layout, and general build, but the button and joystick response is more reminicent of a PS3 controller.  I dig it.I ordered this because my wallet cringed at the thought of paying 80 dollars for a pair of joycons, and I figured I would enjoy playing BOTW on something a bit more substantial.  I have fairly large hands, and this controller feels great!The battery life is stellar as well, I have only had the low batt warning once, and that was after days of play with no charging!  Seriously, this thing must have a beefy lithium in there!  I also love that this uses the same charger (USB-C) as the switch, so you can get by with only one cord.I recently tested the Amiibo function with some self programmed NFC tags I purchased here on Amazon, and it works perfectly!Gripes:I do wish that the rear triggers were located a bit further down as the old Xbox controller were, so I could easily use my middle fingers in concert with my pointer fingers on the front triggers...Oh well, I've grown accustomed to the PS3 controller trigger layout, so I can deal.The plus, minus, cam, and home buttons can be a bit hard to locate if you are unable to look down at the controller, but it only takes some getting used to.  I honestly had more issue getting accustomed to the A button being on the far right...Oh Nintendo, you so silly, the A button goes on the bottom.  Maybe next time 8DAlso, I would prefer the Dpad to be seperated buttons, but it isn't a deal breaker only a personal preference.

They fit the hands nicely, they are well built, and I feel like I have finer control over any game I play.  Docked one star for the cost. Seriously, Nintendo?

Nintendo USB Switch Pro Controller,4.0,Pretty Good,"Reviewed in the United States on January 7, 2020",Color: Black | Edition: Single,True,"I like this controller, it has a good response time and feel solid.  USB-C connector for charging is super nice.  All the buttons feel good. the only reason it did not get 5 out of 5 is that at the very extreme edges of the motion of the left stick, it feels like it is grinding a little bit.  Not so much as to impair game play but it is noticeable.  Leaps and bounds better than the Joy-cons; in terms of overall feel and experience.  Would most likely buy again.",
Nintendo USB Switch Pro Controller,5.0,Based,"Reviewed in the United States on November 28, 2018",Color: Black | Edition: Single,True,"Performs at least as well as the joycons in every way. More comfortable than the joycon mold thing. Face buttons feel good, not my favorite but at least as good as joycons' buttons for most purposes. R/L and ZR/ZL feel extremely smooth, the best bumper and triggers of any controller imo. The joysticks are the smoothest I've ever used, like butter. The sensor doesn't seem to function any differently from the joycon's, but most people seem to prefer aiming in Splatoon with this and I agree. It might just be that the sensor is coming from the center rather than the right joycon. Could also just be the familiarity of holding a more traditional controller making the gyro aiming feel more natural. Either way, I prefer it.",2 people found this helpful
Nintendo USB Switch Pro Controller,4.0,Good until it started drifting,"Reviewed in the United States on December 30, 2019",Color: Black | Edition: Single,True,"I loved this controller. It was great for about 2 straight years. I probably put in close to 300 hours on it playing on the switch. The battery life is longer than other controllers and ergonomically fits in my hands well. Nintendo is notorious for having controllers with drift issues, I didnt believe this applied to their pro controller but it does. It WILL eventually wear down and youll have to get a new controller. Granted I put in a lot of hours, i had to dock a star for the drift.",

The sticks feel as good as an Xbox One controller. The A B X Y buttons are perfectly sized and feel great to press. The only down side is the D-Pad. If you're looking for a controller with a good D-Pad this is not the controller for you. Inputs are not as precise as you want and it's a little too spongey. My other minor issue it the layout of the Plus, Minus, Home, and Screenshot buttons. When playing games like BoTW and fortnite I find myself accidentally pressing the screen shot rather than minus that would bring up the map. Not the biggest issues but I thought it to be notable.

As it becomes more ubiquitous, I think most people will appreciate this as well. Now I can bring one charger for my laptop, switch and controller when on travel. (Take a hint, 3DS)Some are lamenting about the lack of a headphone jack, but I think the comfort and usability will make up for it.

I can game all day, and not worry about running low on power.The only problem I have with this controller is that its analog sticks often overshoot center when released from their extremes. This results in Link throwing a lot of his bombs away from the monsters he is battling, and it is highly frustrating. It can be minimized if actively making manual efforts, but I would much rather fully concentrate on the game.The controller looks cool, the way that the reinforcements can be seen through the plastic.

For example, when you press ""right"", it often activates the up or down directions as well. It makes 2D platformers a bit of a pain, and Tetris 99 is nearly impossible with this D-Pad.

It also feels like it was made for someone with large hands. I have average-sized hands, so while the controller is still perfectly usable to me, it just feels a little large.

It's like a gamble since there's a chance you'll get a really messed up D-Pad and have to send back or get it ""repaired"" when this shouldn't be an issue in the first place for a $70 controller.

Nintendo USB Switch Pro Controller,4.0,"Good for one use, then s*** the bed","Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on May 26, 2017",Color: Black | Edition: Single,True,"Ordered this along with the console and Joy-Con Charging Grip. Everything arrived the monday after launch, plugged the Pro Controller in to play BoTW, and enjoyed my first day of use. Fire the console and controller up on the 2nd day, and both sets of shoulder buttons don't respond on the Pro Controller. I should've returned it sooner or given it a review sooner, but it is what it is now. I'm basically out $70 USD now. I still have the Joy-Con Charging Grip, so i don't know if i wanna spend another 70 to have it possibly fail againupdate (7/8/2018): 2nd controller purchased in June of last year. and got great use out of it, but, unfortunately, I cannot play MK8DX anymore as its now pulling to the left",2 people found this helpful
Nintendo USB Switch Pro Controller,5.0,Better than 3rd party knock offs,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on October 17, 2019",Color: Black | Edition: Single,True,"Tried a highly rated 3rd party controller 1st to see if it would do the job at a lower price point. It was ok, joysticks and buttons felt clunky and cheap. Within a week it had drifting issues. Returned it for this official Nintendo controller and the difference is very obvious. Connects immediately, buttons and joysticks feel really smooth and of a much higher quality. Buy nice, or buy twice. I would definitely recommend this and I might buy another as my joy cons that came with the Switch are having drift issues and are uncomfortable to use with my giant hands.",

I've owned every major console since. Out of all the first party controllers that have ever existed, this is the highest quality one I have ever used. I wouldn't say it's worth spending almost 1/5th the amount of the actual console to have, but you won't be disappointed if you do.It COULD ruin your experience with the Switch. It becomes 'another thing to carry' (as the Switch was built with portability in mind). IF you travel frequently and want to purchase this and the Switch at the same time I'd actually recommend waiting awhile before ordering this. Get used to the Joycons.

Nintendo USB Switch Pro Controller,2.0,Very disappointing.,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on January 16, 2020",Color: Black | Edition: Single,True,"Very disappointed. I was excited to get this controller that everyone has been praising for being ergonomic and having a long battery life. Here are the problems I found:- The thumb pads are not sticky enough so my thumbs kept sliding around and I had to put a lot of pressure to keep my thumbs on without sliding. This was tiring.- The controller is way too big. I had to uncomfortably wrap my hands around the controller and felt like I was stretching my thumbs to reach the thumb pads. (I have normal sized hands for a man whose 5’10”)- The thumb pads were too tall. This meant I had to stretch my thumbs even further.- The - and + buttons are further from the neutral thumb positions than on the joycons. Making reaching them take slightly longer.- The - and + are barely raised above the controller surface. So, they’re harder to find tactically. This is something I could probably get used to eventually.- The cherry on top for me was that L and R buttons sometimes don’t register when you push them past their “clicking” point. You have to press them just a hair harder for them to register. This meant when I was pressing them quickly in-game, that every few button presses were skipped. I don’t know if this a defect or what but. I don’t like buttons that click but don’t register instantly.So in short, the controller wasn’t ergonomic or comfortable for me. The regular joycons on a controller mount are a million times more ergonomic and comfortable for me.",4 people found this helpful

Nintendo USB Switch Pro Controller,2.0,Left Joystick Started Drifting Down After 6 Months,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on September 3, 2019",Color: Black | Edition: Single,True,"Unfortunately the left joystick started drifting down after about 6 months. I'm not a pro smash player or anything, so it seems hard to fathom that I used it more intensely than most during that time. I also kept it really clean, regularly wiping off the residue that easily accumulates on this controller while in use with a soft, dry towel.The other sad part is that Nintendo isn't taking de-facto responsibility for this issue. After I contacted them, they informed me that Pro Controllers purchased outside of the console are only under warranty for 3 months. After I insisted that I would not pay any amount of money for a controller they call ""Pro"" that malfunctioned in 6 months and pointing out the similarities with the class-action joy-con suit, the rep put me on hold to see what he could do. After he returned, he offered me a ""one-time"" free repair.Considering the potential repair costs, if the controller were to malfunction ($30 is 1/2 the cost of a new controller, not to mention however much shipping would have cost), it's hard for me to recommend this product. The main reason I left this at 2 stars is because I had to be quite forceful when talking to the Nintendo rep on the phone which made the whole experience very sour. Had Nintendo taken responsibility more readily for an already known issue (assuming that whatever is plaguing joy-con is also plaguing my Pro Controller - which I could see given how many fewer Pro Controllers there must be in the wild compared to joy-con) I would have likely given this 3 stars, if not 4.",9 people found this helpful

Its battery life is half of most wireless controller from other systems, but I don't personally find it as an issue (you can just connect it though its usb cable and charge it while you play).

I think it was a molding error because the other grip transition is smooth, as you would expect it.

The joy-cons are an interesting concept and are sometimes fun to use, but ergonomically speaking, they're not the greatest for long gaming sessions. That's where the Pro Controller comes in and saves the day. This is a well-made controller with pretty good haptic feedback. It fits well in the hands, and has good quality buttons and texture. The battery also lasts quite a while, and can be recharged using the included USB-A to USB-C cable, which can be attached to any USB-A port on the Switch's dock, or plugged into an appropriate USB-A wall outlet or adapter.",2 people found this helpful

Nintendo USB Switch Pro Controller,2.0,"If you plan on using the d-pad, don't get this until they fix the issues!","Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on December 7, 2017",Color: Black | Edition: Single,True,"I bought this controller to use when my switch is docked, but unfortunately I had to return it. The controller was generally pretty good, but had in my opinion a fatal flaw: the d-pad.The d-pad is way too sensitive, and judging from many online reviews it seems like a poor design rather than a defect with my specific controller. First of all you can press the entire d-pad down from the middle, which is kind of weird because the d-pads I've seen in the past generally pivot around a center point that does not depress. But the issue is that pressing left/right buttons on the d-pad and applying even the tiniest force in the vertical axis will trigger up/down presses. There are videos of this on youtube which match my experience exactly, leading me to believe this is not just a single instance defect.Aside from that, I also found the analog sticks a little too tall. This may not be a problem for others, but after getting used to the stubby joycon analog sticks it was hard to get used to the tall analog sticks on the pro controller. It wasn't a problem in BOTW, but affected my gameplay in Puyo Puyo Tetris, where I found it hard to be precise with the pro controller. Maybe the sensitivity is a little off here too, since I found myself making a ton of misdrops even though I don't make any with the joycons.To summarize:The d-pad alone ruins this controller, and it seems to be a widespread issue. If you press the d-pad buttons at any angle other than directly head on, prepare to get phantom presses in other directions. Giving 2 stars instead of 1 because of the other redeeming qualities.Pros: - Comfortable size and weight - Comes with a nice quality USB-C cable - Buttons are large and clicky, layout is nice - Build quality is seems solid - Looks niceCons: - Expensive - D-pad is way too sensitive!Shoutout to Amazon for processing my return so quickly, no questions asked.

Nintendo USB Switch Pro Controller,5.0,Perfect for Stardew and Smash,"Reviewed in the United States on July 1, 2019",Color: Black | Edition: Single,True,"I held off on buying this controller for a while because the regular Joy-cons were great for Mario Odyssey and Mario Kart. I realized I was putting a little too much stress on them later on in games like Stardew and Smash where you are constantly moving/attacking.This controller completely changed that. It’s very sturdy and easy to use. I’ve barely used the Joy-cons, unless a game requires them, since I purchased it. It will definitely improve your experience on the Switch, especially with the retro Nintendo Online games. It’s worth the money!",

While I could have torn it apart and replaced the joysticks, I figured it was time to get a second one anyway, and pulled the trigger on this one. I'll fix the first one later, in the meantime, I still have my favorite controller on hand.

Nintendo USB Switch Pro Controller,4.0,Good but overpriced,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on March 7, 2020",Color: Black | Edition: Single,True,I believe the switch is three years old now so the price of this controller should have dropped by now considering we’re about halfway through this generation.

It comes with a USB-A to USB-C cable that can be plugged into the dock to charge the controller. If you play a lot while docked or even in tabletop mode, this controller is worth the purchase.",

The price point is pretty high, but the controller seems durable and high-quality enough that I don't anticipate having to replace it for a long while.The battery holds its charge exceptionally well, with one full charge lasting several days, even with extended play. Do be cautious though, because once the system warns you of the low battery, you don't have long to change controllers before it dies. I make it a habit to plug the controller in as soon as I get the warning message, and that works for me.",

After Playing Zelda and Mario Kart 8 with this controller for a few hours, it is a great controller and feels good, but I do prefer the joycons with grip because I like the feel of those joysticks and buttons better.

This has complete solid connection and fixed my issue, but after using it I realized just how uncomfortable the joycons are relative to this. If you like using the switch docked a lot it’s definitely worth the buy. And you’ll have two controllers for split screen as a bonus.

I used to really think the best Nintendo Controller was the GameCube Controller. Well after I bought this one I have my doubts. The grip and the buttons are all solid. The battery last a long time I rarely have to charge it and I would play Zelda BOTW daily. For an adult or just someone with bigger hands I think this is the best way to go rather than using the joy con's as a single controller. I would recommend at least getting one pro controller for your switch.,One person found this helpful

I didn't find the controller too heavy even after playing with it for hours. There was an adjustment period going from the Joy-Cons to the Pro controller but nothing an hour with the controller wouldn't fix. My only complaint is that the ""+"" and ""-"" buttons are square and feel like the home and share button. I wish they went with the design similar to the joy cons where the buttons were actually shaped like a + and -.

For the first one, every once in a while when I either pull the stick all the way to the left or all the way up -- and for the second one it was all the way up or all the way right -- the controller would track briefly in the opposite direction after I released the joystick. This would foil attempts to evade pokemon, and interrupted normal navigation of the game at times. This is incredibly stupid.

It's too bad the price point is so high. I was able to get mine for $62 here, which is $20 off of official price, but even still, very high for a controller.

After having Link run aimlessly due to loss of control, I knew I had to buy the Pro Controller.

The quality of the build seems on-par with 1st party controllers, but the price tag is just stupid. And the HD rumble is just so weak, I would prefer it to just rumble at full power, because I can't even tell where the ""HD"" part comes into play due to it being so feint.It's nice that you can use it on PC/Steam, I had to use it for Rocket League while I was waiting for a replacement Razer Xbox controller (btw, do not buy Razer controllers, they last until the 1-year warranty is nearly up, or a little after, and replacing it does not extend your warranty). Sorry, tangent there, but using it for Rocket League felt a bit jarring even with the similar layout, I never got used to it, probably mostly the triggers...",

The Xbox One controller is widely regarded as the pinnacle of gaming controllers, and this Switch controller one is very similar, so it's quite easy to make the transition.One thing that sets the experience apart from using the joy cons is the placmeent of the + and - keys, as they are much easier to each. The shoulder buttons are also much more solid.Highly recommended.",

It feels very nice in your hand, and looks pretty decent too. I think the buttons are responsive, the sticks feel comparable to the other two big guy's controllers. I wish the console supported analog triggers but for digital triggers these are fine. I prefer the batteries be rechargeable (which these are) as long as they don't lose their ability to hold their charge anytime soon, but so far so good. I wish it were slightly cheaper, but you'll prefer this to the joy cons for sure.",2 people found this helpful

Nintendo will fix them for free but they need to be shipped, time to repair etc.  We even bought JOYCONs a year and a half after getting our Switch and they were still completely defective.  Why NINTENDO continues to put out such inferior hardware is beyond me, especially when it effects 100% of the JOYCONS, and they obviously know about the issue.  These controllers are heavy for the kids but actually function.",

I had to remove the tape and reduce the number of layers of tape after it wasn't ideal. I was so glad that it worked better that I played and haven't adjusted the number of layers again, but I'm sure I could fine tune it a little better if I did.Other than that, it is a comfortable controller to hold.3 stars because it should work properly out of the box.

The joy stick is not soft and doesn't let your thumb rest in a curve like an Xbox remote would. Plus the A, B, X, Y, buttons are really rigid and aren't smooth around the edges. All these things make it uncomfortable to play for long periods of time. Especially if your playing online games, you could find yourself playing for an hour easily.My BIGGEST DISLIKE about this is that there isn't any ON/OFF button.

My main initial complaint at that point was that it didn't have a headset jack like Xbox and PS4 controllers have, not a huge deal. However, when I started playing Tetris99, I noticed a new flaw that became infuriating: the d-pad doesn't work well. When you push left or right, sometimes it pushes up or down too. In Tetris99, that means you're accidentally doing to do a ""hard drop"" when you intend to rotate the piece. I stopped using the pro controller with Tetris99 because I was so frustrated with it.

This means there will be no smooth throttle or braking in any future racing games unless you were to make use of the right stick for that purpose.It's worth noting that the overall build and feel of the controller lacks some of the soft touch plastics and rubbers of many modern controllers, Xbox One controllers usually have a pretty soft touch plastic at the grips, and you can custom order one with rubberized grips, the back of the Pro controller looks like it would have rubberized grips, but it is in fact the hardest plastic I've ever held with a controller.",26 people found this helpful

Nintendo USB Switch Pro Controller,1.0,Great until it's not,"Reviewed in the United States on November 27, 2019",Color: Black | Edition: Single,True,"This controller is fantastic at first, but is destined to have problems. Know that if you buy a Pro Controller, chances are, you WILL have problems down the line. It's such a bummer that this is a common issue among Switch owners. I take great care of my things, and my Pro controller has 2 significant problems after about 6 months of use.1) Left stick issues. When pushing the left stick upwards, the controller experiences what I've been calling ""reverse drift"" -- it pulls the input down. I've calibrated dozens of times, and this fixes the issue momentarily, but it always comes back.2) R-button issues. The R button's input works OK, but only if you push the button down with a bit more force. If you're playing a game that requires holding down the R button (like checking the map on Hollow Knight for example), the button will lose input unless you're really pushing down.This is my 3rd Switch controller to give me issues. I have 2 sets of Joycons that experience joystick problems as well. I love my Switch and am super bummed by their controller issues.It's worth noting that this controller is pretty expensive for the issues it experiences. I've had multiple DualShock 4s for years, with much more playtime on them, with no issues. Same with Gamecube controllers -- some of which I've had since the early 2000s. This is simply unacceptable for a company of Nintendo's stature and a controller of this price. Please Nintendo. Please fix this. Fix your Joycons. Fix your Pro Controller.

Nintendo USB Switch Pro Controller,2.0,Useless for Mac gaming,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on June 30, 2021",Color: Black | Edition: Single,True,"The build quality on this controller is excellent. If you are buying it for a Switch, or I imagine for Windows gaming, you will probably be pleased.But I bought it for a Mac, and it has been a nightmare to use. In theory it should be simple to just pair over bluetooth, but that rarely works. It either won't connect at all, or if it does it will be with extreme lag, making any remotely action-oriented game unplayable. You can also plug it in directly with USB-C, and this typically works better, though it will still often be totally unresponsive, or not work with certain games.If you are looking for a gaming controller for a Mac, this is not it. Look elsewhere.",

So sometimes I'll want to go left during Tetris, and BOOM- 2 hard drops in a row. Just like that.I've lost many a game to non-formidable undeserving foes due to this junk.

At first I was very happy with it.  The joysticks feel perfect and offer greater travel and persission when compared to the joycons.  The buttons are bigger and feel great.  I'm very impressed that you can use it both wired or wirelessly. However like when playing the console on the go with the joycons attached I'm feeling my forefinger and middle finger being pushed appart.  With most of the weight of the controller resting on the side of my middle finger.  The joycons grip feels much better in this regard.  If the controller didn't start to feel uncomfortable after 45 minutes of using it it would be well worth the expence.  .,

Nintendo USB Switch Pro Controller,2.0,Premium-feeling controller with a terrible D-pad,"Reviewed in the United States on August 27, 2017",Color: Black | Edition: Single,True,"The controller feels very sturdy, and the grips are nice. It feels like a premium product—although definitely too heavy for long periods of use. The sticks have a rigid feel compared to other controllers. The face buttons are nice and large, which sort of reminds me of a Genesis controller.The huge downside is the D-pad. It is poorly designed, with zero tactile feedback and no tilt-nub in the center (you can literally press the entire D-pad down all at once), resulting in a squishy, vague sense of control. What's worse, many people (including me) have received defective D-pads, where pressing one direction will activate an adjacent direction. Instead of sending mine back for a replacement or repair (because it didn't solve the issue for many others), I opted to open up my controller and fix the issue by placing a small piece of electrical tape over part of the contact that was giving me trouble.For its price, this is a disappointing controller. The D-pad issues are inexcusable at any price point, but I feel that Nintendo should've invested more into the design and quality control if they're asking for this much. Add the fact that the left JoyCon doesn't even have a true D-pad, and it's really unforgivable for Nintendo to get it so wrong on this controller.",4 people found this helpful

The buttons are too mushy, and the d-pad is all one piece. This makes playing games like Celeste very difficult toward the final levels - not because of player skill, but because you will often need to switch from left to right on the d-pad. Those kind of switches causes d-pads that aren't separated to hit up/down along the way, and one mis-click can ruin a game.It's nice if you want to casually play switch with a more-conventional controller, but labeling it as ""pro controller"" is maybe the wrong move here.",

Lovely.The d-pad is middling at best... there are plenty of better third-party options out there, especially the 8BitDo controllers like the M30. The Pro feels fine and all, but that drift... oh, and the placement of the Home, Capture, +, and - buttons are kind of odd, making it very easy to hit something you didn't intend to. Sure, it has amiibo support which no third-party products can have (and do we reeeeeally care?), but so do the Joy-Cons that came with the system.Overall, a pretty big disappointment considering it's the ""official"" non-Joy-Con controller.

This is very frustrating in fast-paced games where accurate input is critical.I would much prefer the d-pad style of the joy-cons (four distinct buttons) as well as the joysticks from the joycons over the garbage d-pad and joysticks in this controller.",2 people found this helpful

I bought a pro controller about a year ago for a friend and hers works beautifully and hasn’t had any issues since- but mine came with a drifting control pad and half the buttons didn’t work, had severe lag, or didn’t have any response whatsoever. I tried updating the controller but there were no updates for it. I was having issues with my right control paddle that came with the switch console so I got the pro to avoid that, only to get a controller that had more issues right out of the box. Amazing. Nintendo has seriously forsaken the quality of their newer controllers. I expect much better from a product that costs so GD much.",11 people found this helpful

Here's a fun question, what does the PlayStation THREE controller have that's better than this atrocity? For one, the buttons I intended to press actually do what I intended to do.

I've used some truly awful controllers before (Dualshock 3), but this one certainly takes the Cake. What's even more embarrassing is that something so awful didn't come from a 3rd party company like Nyko, which I've also bought some truly terrible controllers from.",

I heard and felt a pop in the left analog stick.Now it will either not recognize down input or the controller gets stuck and keeps the left input pressed. I can hear something broken inside the controller.This is pretty unacceptable for the cost of this  controller. Add the fact that it hasn't gotten nearly as much use as the joy-cons as I mostly play in handheld mode. I'm extremely disappointed in the quality of the build.If these things can't even last a year of moderate use, then you're better off buying a cheaper third-party controller.

It is possible to hold down one direction on the d-pad an push it in such a way that you can trigger both adjacent directions. Not only that, but if you really want  to, you can trigger the opposite direction on the d-pad. Nothing short of Nintendo going back to the drawing board on this and offering free fixes/replacements would be satisfactory. Incredibly disappointing.

Which is why it gets 1 STAR. (I would put NO STARS if I could) When using this controller, the left directional thumbstick changes direction randomly at the WORST possible moments. It feels like a flaw in the design, where it overshoots from snapback. If you press the thumbstick all the way one direction and then let go, (which happens naturally when I play), it snaps back into position, then overshoots and changes direction. When playing platformer games, (which I'm CrAzY about), this flaw makes the games nearly unplayable.

Every other press goes in the wrong direction. For example, you hang on a wall and press right (into the wall) and the character goes up the wall! So it's registering a diagonal press instead of a horizontal one.I can't return it because I decided to follow an online tutorial to stick tape between some of the contacts. That did improve it but it's still flaky enough to drive me crazy when playing a game as exacting as Celeste.For a $70 controller this is totally unacceptable.",9 people found this helpful

Ps controller lasts years and years with same type of gaming! If Nintendo wants to keep the quality this low then the price should match it.  Outrageous price for this quality.,3 people found this helpful

Nintendo USB Switch Pro Controller,4.0,The best? Maybe not...,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on June 16, 2019",Color: Black | Edition: Single,False,"I bought one of these locally at Wal-Mart with my first Nintendo Switch since given away. I am buying another Switch for myself and I'll buy another Pro Controller (on Amazon because they're cheaper than WalMart) but I was looking to see what third party controllers have come out since I last looked.For the most part, I still think this is the best wireless controller for the Nintendo Switch. The only one close to it is the PowerA one. The PowerA wireless controller is very comparable though and has different features that I feel most gamers would use. By this I mean the back customizable buttons and the option to use rechargable batteries instead of needing to charge the controller through USB-C. That being said, I feel more comfortable buying the ""Official"" one made and sold by Nintendo. Knowing it's made with top notch plastic parts that just feel right and it just works and always should (except the D-PAD sometimes doesn't work right I've heard.)I would fault no-one for choosing the PowerA one over it though. lf you want an improved D-PAD (this is pure opinion) and don't care about losing the rechargeable internal battery and have your own rechargeable batteries then you might want to consider the PowerA. Not having rumble nor the ability to scan Amiibos is not that big of a deal. However, it DOES have motion control and mappable Advanced Gaming Buttons with the two more buttons on the back. More or less it's otherwise identical to this pro controller and 99% of gamers would be satisfied with it in comparison. They have many options to choose from with some nice custom designs some even featuring Zelda or Mario since they are an officially licensed wireless controller through Nintendo. You can get blank design simple colored controllers too if you just prefer something more basic. They range in price from $35 - $49 USD on Amazon currently.There are plenty of wired controllers out there too though -- that run cheaper generally than these two wireless options. Losing the wireless freedom of range and movement is something most are not willing to give up but if you are you might want to think about one of these controllers instead. Honestly you're going to be playing Nintendo Switch games so controllers are not going to matter as much as they would on the other two consoles IMO. Not saying that there isn't competitive action-paced games on the Nintendo Switch but the majority of the top titles that have mulitplayer or that are competitve are turned-based with the few exceptions like Super Smash Bros. Ultimate or something akin to that.One of the new options here is PDP's Faceoff Deluxe+ Audio controllers [ASIN - B07RV6XS6L]. They come with microphone jack built in which lets you plug in and use any headset via the 3.5mm audio jack. I'm not sure how many games on the Nintendo Switch will support in-game audio/USB-chat but this might be the best controller on the Switch if multiplayer is your thing. Of course you can always meet up with your friends and chat on something like Discord too. This controller lets you adjust volume on-the-fly using the D-pad on the controller and also has dual programmable paddle-style buttons on the back similar to what the PowerA offers. They too are officially licensed by Nintendo but currently only come with a couple color choices in the form of interchangeable faceplates. They don't have rumble, gyro motion controllers, or Amiibo support either. And yes they are wired with a 10' cord. That being said they are only $25 so they would make for a great alternative controller if you need more than one for when friends are over.",One person found this helpful

Nintendo USB Switch Pro Controller,4.0,Nintendo Switch Pro Controller,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on October 14, 2017",Color: Black | Edition: Single,False,"The Nintendo Switch Pro Controller is very well built, it's comfortable, has some weight to it and has textured grips to keep the controller from slipping out of your hands. There's no creaking or bending of the controller while playing, It's the alternative choice for those who want a more traditional way to play games compared to the Joy-Cons setup with the standard Attachment or Charging Grip. It comes with a USB-C cable and can be charged from the Switch docking station or AC adapter.It's an overall improvement over the Wii U Pro Controller, ditching the odd right joystick placement and moving it below the primary buttons, resembling a Xbox controller. It also has larger trigger buttons up top and larger X, A, Y, B buttons which are certainly welcome but it does still lack the pressure sensitive secondary analog triggers that both the Xbox One and PlayStation 4 controllers have - I personally like having that when it comes to racing games. The analog sticks feel smooth and rise slightly around their circumference to prevent your thumbs from slipping off.  The classic D-pad makes a return again on the Pro-Controller, It's the same size as the d-pad on the Wii and Wii U Pro Controllers. It feels responsive and has the solid quality clicks you've come to expect from Nintendo controllers but I found that in a few instances, I've accidently click one direction when pressing another, thankfully it doesn't happen to me all the time but it could be improved.  The + and - button placements are easier to use compared to the Joy-Con setup and are more in reach this time around compared to the Wii U Pro Controller but I wish the buttons would protrude outward more like the Wii U Pro Controller. While playing and without looking down at the controller, I find myself feeling around the for the + or - buttons because they sit almost flush with the controller face and it makes them somewhat difficult to press. The Screenshot and Home buttons also sit very flush and sometimes I'll accidently end up pressing them instead of the - and + buttons.The battery life is phenomenal, I can't remember the last time I plugged in the Pro Controller to charge it up. It can hold a charge for 40 hours and takes 4-5 hours to fully recharge. The Controller has the advertised ""HD Rumble"" that's been featured with the Joy-Con controllers. As far as I could tell—with the handful of games I've tried—the rumble feedback functions about the same as it does with the Joy-Cons.  It also has Motion Sensors and built-in Amiibo functionality, you can place the Amiibo figure on top of the switch icon of the controller to scan it.It connects to the Switch via Bluetooth so you can easily use this controller on your home computers or smart phone as well. I've had some trouble getting it to connect on Windows 7 but then I tried Windows 10 and it was as simple as having your PC search for a BT device while holding the sync button on top of the controller for 3 seconds. Once the controller is properly synced, you can use it just like any other Bluetooth controller. Initially, I had some issues getting the Pro Controller to connect to my Switch but since then, it's been connecting every single time, one push of the Home Button and it takes 2 seconds.Just like the Joy-Cons, the bottom of the Pro Controller has four LEDs that represent which player it's set to(starting from the left) and if it's properly connected to the system. It is a pricey controller, at this point it cost $69 and that makes it a good $15-20 more expensive then it's competitors. It currently does not have a headphone/mic jack.Comfort wise, It could possibly be the most comfortable controller out there. Sometimes I even forget I'm still holding it when gaming for a while.  If you own a Nintendo Switch and want a more traditional way to play your games that provides a proper d-pad, larger primary buttons, ergonomic shoulder buttons, extremely long battery life and is very comfortable to hold..  the Switch Pro Controller is certainly a step-up from your Joy-Cons.",

Nintendo USB Switch Pro Controller,4.0,An (almost) perfect controller for Nintendo's latest innovation.,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on March 17, 2019",Color: Black | Edition: Single,False,"FULL DISCLOSURE: I paid for this with my own funds and am giving solely my opinions in this review.I have had this controller since I got my Switch in Dec 2017 and have used it extensively since. I have played upwards of 60 hours of Mario Kart and 25 hours of Rocket League as well as my other games almost exclusively with this controller and can say that it is without a doubt responsive, comfortable, and worth every cent. I also happened to snag it for $60 on Prime day back then as a plus, making my purchase that much more satisfactory.In my time in gaming I have used numerous controllers and know what I love and hate. I like the Xbox One S controller for its ergonomics, excellent triggers, and premium build and strongly dislike the DualShock 4 for its unergonomic feel, mushy face buttons and symmetric analog sticks. However, on my ranking of favorite controllers the Switch Pro is now tied in first place with the GameCube controller (only because of childhood nostalgia).(Mostly) every feature of the Switch Pro is better than any other controller I have used, including the XBone S controller. The analog sticks have the perfect amount of resistance. The face buttons are large and have great actuation. The motion controls are some of Nintendo's best efforts in that method of control. The battery life is quite impressive, beating out both the Xbox and PS controllers by a significant margin. The icing on the charging cake is the USB-C compatibility which is so much better than micro-USB. The shoulder buttons are all a short pull and feel incredibly responsive.However, after extensive use of the Switch Pro, I have run into a few gripes that I hope Nintendo improves on in the future. First, the d-pad. It is, like others have noted, inaccurate and very fiddly feeling. It moves around much too easily and can be pressed all at once like a button. Given Nintendo's history with the d-pad, this is surprising.Second, lack of analog triggers is glaring, on this and the Joy-Cons, given that Nintendo was one of the first to implement analog triggers in their controllers. For racing games, this will be sorely missed.Third, the overall construction of the controller feels less premium and more plasticky despite the high price when compared to my Sport White Xbox One S controller which MSRP's for the same price. It's definitely weighty, but slightly cheaper feeling.Lastly, maybe this is just me, but my HD Rumble seems to have worn out somewhat and seems more like a mild grinding sound now instead of the revving engine I first felt in Mario Kart when I got my Switch. After using my XBone S controller which revs like a lawnmower, I really started to wish I had a similar feel on my Switch Pro. This deterioration appears to be a common issue with most of the Switch's controllers, with Joy-Cons wearing out in a year's time.But, even with the cons that are there currently, I still recommend this controller for those who use their Switch in docked mode for at least half of the time. If you're a mostly portable player, then I'm hard pressed to tell you to go out and buy one of these. If you're like me and you play docked a lot, then you NEED this. I'm telling you! You NEED this! It absolutely stands among the best of the current gen controllers.",

Nintendo USB Switch Pro Controller,4.0,"Overpriced, nothing Pro about it","Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on December 9, 2017",Color: Black | Edition: Single,False,"This controller is essential if you want to game on the Switch. Not only does it feel great in the hand, the offset joysticks (like the Xbox) are a welcome change from the Wii U controller. However, I've never been sold on the reversed XY and AB placement that Nintendo chooses to use on its controllers. I'd prefer if I could change the order of these buttons. I prefer the layout on the PS4 and Xbox controllers and I'd like to put this same layout onto the Nintendo controller.After switching from the Xbox One or PS4, I am forever finding I press B instead of A or Y instead of X. It always takes me at least a week or so to get back into the Nintendo layout. Sometimes I just forget and press the wrong button. This is a real problem that Nintendo refuses to address. For any gamer who's used the Xbox or PS4 for long enough, moving to a Nintendo is a very frustrating experience. If you're going to give us a Pro controller, let us swap the AB and XY placement to match the Xbox or PS4. This is supposed to be a Pro controller, right?The biggest problem is the ease with which this controller connects to the Switch. With the PS4 and Xbox One, you have to press the PS or X button explicitly to get the controller to connect. Unfortunately, Nintendo designed this controller to connect on any button press (including the shoulder buttons). This means that if the controller gets lost under something, you can find that controller randomly connects to the Switch, begins controlling the unit and moving the cursor (much to your displeasure). Thankfully, Nintendo includes a 'Find My Controller' feature by running the rumble on the controller. So, it's relatively easy to find the controller (as long as it still carries a charge). However, finding the controller easily doesn't help much when you're fighting against that same random controller which is now connected and continually moving your cursor.The controller includes a 60 inch (5 foot) long USB-C charging cable. You can never have enough well made USB-C charging cables. Unfortunately, it's not quite long enough to be useful as a wired controller unless you sit close to the Switch. I prefer the 10-12 foot cables that let you game using a cable. Again, this is a miss by Nintendo. Make the cable longer.The battery in this controller lasts a long time. Besides the random connect issue, the NFC reader is easily the weakest part of this controller. It can be difficult to find the location of the NFC reader location and when you do, the Amiibo has to be touching the controller perfectly. The NFC reader has a very weak reader signal and will sometimes fail to read an Amiibo entirely. Because of this, I don't necessarily trust writing often to my Amiibos for fear of corruption. I'd prefer if Nintendo would decouple this feature from the controller and offer us a separate standalone reader where we can leave the Amiibo on the pad. Just take it off of the controller if you can't really make it work well. Note that the NFC reader on this controller does work marginally better than the reader on the JoyCons, which actually offer no solid place for the Amiibo to touch.At $69, it is overpriced for a controller with its features. The price for this controller should be no more than $49. It's definitely overpriced. Though, I will say that the wireless connection from the Pro Controller to the Switch is rock stable. I've never once had the connection drop even at a reasonable distance away (10-12 feet), unlike the JoyCons which seem to have frequent disconnection problems no matter the distance. Unfortunately, this controller cannot be used like the JoyCons. If you have a game that needs to use the hand pointer control (like the Wiimote), you're stuck using the JoyCons or you'll need to pick up the Switch and use the touch screen.Overall, it's a decent controller, but it doesn't deserve the 'Pro' moniker. It really does not offer 'Pro' features in any real sense. You can't reprogram buttons, you can't change the joystick tops, you can't plug headphones into it, it has no expansion slot and there aren't any rear paddles. In short, it's a standard controller labeled as 'Pro' in an attempt to command the overpriced $69 price tag. However, this controller is still leaps and bounds better than the unreliable JoyCons.",One person found this helpful

Nintendo USB Switch Pro Controller,4.0,Almost perfect - 9/10,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on June 19, 2020",Color: Black | Edition: Single,False,"The controller feels fantastic in your hands.  This is especially apparent after trying to use the tiny joycons with their even tinier buttons and joysticks.  If your an adult with moderate to large hands you need this controller.  Playing games like Resident Evil 5 or Doom feel worlds better with a controller that is designed for hands larger than a 10 year old's.  Using the controller mount for the joycons is not a substitute for a pro controller.  After using the pro controller, you realize that the joycon's tiny buttons, joysticks, and shoulder buttons are things you tolerate.  Even if you decide against buying this controller (most likely due to the price), buy a cheaper third party traditional controller.  Comfort - 10/10The buttons are large, which I love, reminding more of the larger buttons seen on the original SNES controller.  The buttons along with the D-pad have a matte finish that feel great.  A special mention of the D-pad must be made.  This D-pad feels fantastic.  Compared to the 8bitdo SN30 pro, it is NO CONTEST.  The D-pad for Nintendo's pro controller is top of the line and blows the third party D-pads out of the water.  The Joysticks feel good, maybe even great.  They have raised edges with ridges for increased grip which feel good on your thumbs.  I still prefer the concave shape of the Xbox One joysticks but the switch pro controller joysticks are comfortable, responsive, and accurate.  Compared to the Wii U pro controller, the joysticks feel less sturdy though.  The Wii U pro controller feel sturdy and require more effort to move them, which I like.  This is not a big deal but I feel some may not like joysticks that have less resistance. Buttons and Joysticks - 9/10When it come to the value, the switch pro controller is a sea of grey.  It really depends on the value you place on each individual feature found in the pro controller.  The third party enhanced switch controllers are around 20$ cheaper and feel close to the same but lack many of the features the pro controller has (it doesn't even have basic rumble).  You can also find even cheaper controllers that don't have even the most basic features of a pro controller but are still fine controllers if all your looking for is a comfortable gaming experience for your hands.  I like the HD rumble and motion controls and would like to have the convenience of amiibo support (even though I don't really see it lasting much longer) so I don't mind paying the 70$.  Nintendo's controllers are also known for lasting forever, so you most likely won't need to buy another one for the rest of your life (I still use the gamecube and Wii U pro controllers I got at the launches).  Overall Value - 8/10",
