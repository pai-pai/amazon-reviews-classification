Nintendo Switch – OLED Model w/ Neon Red & Neon Blue Joy-Con,4.0,A lot of fun and very versatile play,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on March 13, 2023",Color: White | Style: Console,True,"""Santa"" got this for my son this year and it ended up reignited the gamer in me. I absolutely love how versatile this system is. You can play handheld with controllers attached to the screen, with the controllers separate from the screen and attached to a handheld game controller adapter, or you can dock the screen and play on your TV. It makes it a great activity for my son on long car rides. The screen is bright and colorful. I definitely recommend getting a glass screen protector and carrying case for it, though. The screen is a bit heavy and wouldn't be very hard for a kid to drop this, even while they're playing it. The graphics aren't quite as good on the screen as they are on the TV but that's sort of expected. On the TV, the graphics are excellent depending on the game. Mariokart in particular looks awesome.ERGONOMICS: As versatile as the controllers make this system, the Switch controllers do not lend themselves very well to larger hands. I guess this system is geared more toward kids in that regard. The buttons and joysticks are small and not very ergonomic for adult sized hands. Using the controller adapter isn't bad but using the individual controllers to allow multiplayer is cumbersome. The controllers are just too small. I was able to play only a couple races in Mariokart before my hands began to hurt from trying to hold the controller. I ended up buying an off-brand wireless controller for multiplayer situations, which I even find more comfortable than the adapter so I also recommend buying a second one if you plan on using the system. While playing with the controllers attached to the side of the screen is a bit more comfortable, the screen is a bit heavy as I said before, and holding it up for ten minutes of play got difficult even for me, so I imagine it would be even heaver for a kid to hold.Overall I really like the system for its versatility. With two ways to play on the go and a more stationary option for at home play, it doesn't limit you to one style of playing. You can figure out which style is more comfortable for you depending on your situation.",14 people found this helpful
Nintendo Switch – OLED Model w/ Neon Red & Neon Blue Joy-Con,4.0,"Unimpressive Hardware, Overpriced, But Very Fun","Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on October 18, 2022",Color: Neon Blue and Red | Style: Console,True,"As a kid I owned a Nintendo, an original Gameboy, and a Super Nintendo. I've been aware of the Nintendo consoles since then, but haven't put any time or money into the platform since my Super Nintendo days. Instead Sony has been getting my time and money. Using the PS5 as my benchmark, initially I was very disappointed in the Switch. However, after purchasing the top Nintendo exclusive games and putting considerable time into it, I've come around and I'm definitely happy I purchased the Switch OLED. What I failed to understand when I purchased the Switch is that Nintendo is not competing directly against Sony and Microsoft. Nintendo has essentially become the ""Disney"" of gaming. In that I mean that Nintendo has their characters and storylines that we've all grown up with. Now we want our kids to share in that experience, which doesn't really require an 8k capable GPU. Instead, being a clever company, Nintendo has targeted kids with a comparatively less expensive console, sporting handheld capability, tons of swag, and easy to configure parental controls. For adults that want to play after the kids have gone to sleep, the platform supports some more mature titles, and a regular controller experience.I really like the classic games like Zelda, Mario, & Metroid. The gameplay is improved and the stories are familiar. Nintendo's Pro Controller is fantastic (it's also a must for adults). I like being able to take the console on trips, and dock it at my TV at home. I also really appreciate the use of micro SD storage. Downloaded games seem to average around 5.5 GB in size, so adding a 256 GB micro SD to your built in 64 GB of storage should allow plenty of space for most people. I like the game sales in the eShop, as that's the time to buy. And while I don't recommend it, the ability to purchase cartridges is a bit nostalgic for me.I really dislike the terrible, dated hardware choices that Nintendo made. The OLED screen may be an improvement over the original Switch, but it's still not great at only 720p resolution. The wired network adapter in the dock is slightly faster than the wireless adapter in the console, but both are terribly slow and it takes a long time to download games. The Nintendo network speeds are also laughably slow, and I wonder if they are trying to preserve the nostalgia of the load screen. Keep in mind that unless you want to get up to change your game, or potentially have your kid lose a game, you'll want to download your games from the eShop. So you're really forced to deal with the slow network experience everytime you want something new. It's still worth the suffering up front for the long-term convenience of having it downloaded. Another confusing hardware choice is the Joy-Con controller. These things are overpriced trash. I can see where Nintendo was going, but they have some major shortcomings. To charge the Joy-Con's they need to be connected to the console, or you have to purchase the charging grip (~$35). Nintendo included a grip, but not one with charging capabilities, which means you'll have to switch to handheld mode to keep playing, or stop playing while they charge. Instead of buying a charging grip, I recommend the Pro Controller, which has a USB-C port on the front for charging while playing. It's better than the Joy-Con in every way, and cheaper. Which brings me to my biggest complaint, the price. Just like Disney, Nintendo is fully aware of the grip they have on your kids, and thus they charge accordingly. There is no part of this console that makes it worth the price. You either want to play (or your kids to play) Zelda, Mario, Metroid, etc. or you don't. If you do, then you will pay. Need an extra power adapter so you don't have to disconnect it from the dock everytime...overpriced. Need replacement Joy-Con's because the included ones started to drift...overpriced. Any game at regular price...overpriced. Why would I pay Nintendo more for a game that's going to look and play better on my PS5 for less money?I think you get my point. The Switch is not for everyone. If you have kids, or you love the Nintendo original titles, there's likely a Switch in your future. If you're buying it for you (an adult), get the Pro Controller and don't look back. If you have another ""serious"" console, don't buy any non-exclusive titles for the Switch. They're usually cheaper and better on literally any other console.",385 people found this helpful

Nintendo Switch – OLED Model w/ Neon Red & Neon Blue Joy-Con,5.0,It's just... Squidtastic!,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on January 18, 2023",Color: Splatoon | Style: Console,True,"Disclaimer: In my pictures, you can see I received the Japanese version. I bought mine from a third-party seller, no matter the region. Any switch can play any physical or digital game, as they are not region-locked. If you end up getting one overseas, make sure your router's Wi-Fi channel is under 149, or you'll have trouble connecting to the Wi-Fi.Now to start... I myself wasn't interested in upgrading, as I at first didn't see the point since the improvements seemed minor. Oh boy, was I wrong! To start, the main upgrade is the screen, which is so much better than the original. It's way brighter and makes every game you play look better in handheld mode. I couldn't help but want to play on my switch more than my dock just because of how good it looks.This switch is also so beautiful. I love the design of the dock. The joycons and the switch itself as they are based on the game's team colors that are picked each time. The switch also has engravings on the joystick and console so that you can actually feel the texture difference. The work that Nintendo has put into the console is incredible.Don't even get me started on how they changed the power and volume buttons to make them easier to press. I also love the new fully adjustable kickstand and Ethernet port, which make it much easier to dock.Oh, and the sound coming from the switch sounds so much better now that they changed and added another speaker!If you're interested in getting your first switch, I highly recommend this one! But if you're upgrading, I know I said earlier that it's not much of an upgrade; that's still true, as they only made the storage bigger, added a bigger and brighter screen, added Ethernet, and improved kickstand support for old switch owners. It's your choice if you really value the handheld experience or a better kickstand. But if you do, you will not be disappointed!",47 people found this helpful

Nintendo Switch – OLED Model w/ Neon Red & Neon Blue Joy-Con,5.0,"Absolutely worth the upgrade for handheld users, and worth considering for docked users too.","Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on February 10, 2023",Color: Neon Blue and Red | Style: Console,True,"I watched and read several reviews of this product before purchasing, and I can tell you that if you primarily use your switch in the handheld configuration, it is absolutely worth the price. The display is much sharper, more vibrant, and has far better low-light characteristics compared to my regular switch, and it almost feels like it is higher-resolution despite being the same. The construction feels higher quality as well, with the surfaces you mainly interact with being made of metal. The kickstand is what the og switch should've had, feels much sturdier and offers adjustable angles. All that and the built in storage is 64 gb instead of the 32 gb the og switch offers, and the dock is allegedly less prone to scratching the screen and body when inserting and removing the switch from the dock compared to the dock that comes with the original. All in all, stellar product, worth the increased price if you're a handheld user. There isn't any noticeable difference when playing in docked mode, so if you're either planning on using or currently use your switch in docked mode, I would still recommend this over the og switch because of the increased internal storage, and the Ethernet port that is built into the dock.It's worth the price difference. Very satisfied with this product.",23 people found this helpful

Nintendo Switch – OLED Model w/ Neon Red & Neon Blue Joy-Con,4.0,"Appealing, reasonably quick, glitch-free software","Reviewed in the United States on November 29, 2022",Color: White | Style: Console,True,"I have never owned a Nintendo Switch before, but have played games on and off for some years on PC, Xbox, Apple TV 4K, and on mobile phones. The Switch OLED intrigued me and my brief impressions, after buying one and toying with it a bit, are the following:On the plus side: the screen is bright with deep and impressive colors; the screen size is ample - much larger than that of an average 6.1"" phone; the charging adapter is sturdy looking; the joy-con controls and the Nintendo OS are both intuitive and easy to use; the OS appears to be reasonably glitch-free - updates are very quick and setting up two separate user accounts and linking them to two separate Nintendo accounts was very easy. Installing a micro SD card was also very easy and the console automatically updated to enable SD card storage. It will download content by deafult to the larger storage drive, in this case - to the micro SD.On the minus side: the bright screen quickly drains the battery; auto-brightness makes certain games look dim; charging is rather slow; purchasing games from the e-shop is a bit cumbersome; Nintendo will send you TONS of emails for everything that you buy/change, etc.If this is your first time (like it was for me) using a Nintendo Switch console, the most important thing to know, I think, is that you will need to create a user account on the console for each person who uses the console. Those user accounts ARE NOT the same as Nintendo accounts. You will need to make Nintendo accounts separately, preferably BEFORE you turn on the console for the initial setup. You won't be able to buy an individual or a family subscription for Nintendo Online until you start the console, set it up, link the user account you created on it initially to your (already created) Nintendo account, and then purchase said subscription through the console and not through another device.Other than that, the Switch OLED works well and has deep, vibrant colors. Time will tell how long the battery and everything else will last. The build quality is certainly good.",41 people found this helpful

Nintendo Switch – OLED Model w/ Neon Red & Neon Blue Joy-Con,5.0,One of the Best Products Ever Made - Period!,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on January 24, 2022",Color: Neon Blue and Red | Style: Console,True,"First, to be clear, I play exclusively in handheld mode.  (No proper technophile allows a video game system to be connected to their 4k tv if it does not output 4k. LOL!)  I am also a console (Xbox) gamer and have been playing video games since the mid 1980s.With that being said, this device is shockingly awesome.  Why?  You can basically play games with the graphically fidelity of almost (but not quite) the Xbox One/PS 4 in your hands.  This blows me away.  The fact that I can play NBA 2k, FIFA, Need for Speed, Grid, Mortal Kombat, Puzzle Quest and so many other games on the go is truly a joy to behold.  As a result, much to my surprise, this has been the console I have ended up playing the most.  It's easy to see why - I can take it with me wherever I go.  I travel for work and personal reasons.  This is with me and I can continue playing my games on it.  Don't get me wrong, I still enjoy my Xbox experience and still play PC games as well.  They are awesome.  However, I notice I play this more because it can be on an airplane with me, in the bed, during lunch at work, when I travel, etc.  Then, sometimes when I get home, I may want to continue my gaming.  So it is racking up more hours than my Xbox and PC (which I certainly still enjoy).Then, the OLED screen is gorgeous.  I had an original Switch.  I absolutely love this screen, the brightness, sharpness and clarity.  Some games look totally different.  If you already have an original Switch, if you can, sell it (or give it away) and get this one.  I absolutely love it.  I even bought a 512GB micro SD card.  I am in a form of gaming Nirvana.  You will really enjoy this model.Finally, I do think that Nintendo is in a truly awesome position with the Switch.  I am not sure if Nintendo even realizes how close they are to dominating the video game market for decades.  Why?  Think about it.  As of January 2022 the Switch is the leading console with over 100 million units sold.  It really, at this point, needs one thing to finish off the competition for decades.  What is it they need?  Just a little more power.  If Nintendo creates a device that has the graphical and processing power of an Xbox One/PS4, can do 1080p in handheld mode, with a 7 inch OLED screen, (and 4k when docked) Nintendo will rule gaming for at least a decade.  Why?  1080p on OLED, at the handheld distance from the eye, appears almost as detailed as 4k at a tv watching distance.  With the processing power of the Xbox One/PS4, developers can bring tons of more of their best games (triple A titles) to the Switch.  So, a Switch that powerful, with a large number of triple A games on it and with a screen that good in handheld mode, the Switch's market share would crush the competition.At any rate, I digress.  If you are considering this device.  Get it!  Period.  The build is so awesome on this variant.  You will love it.I have to go now.  I have to play my OLED Switch - LOL!Also, the delivery from this seller was also good.  It came ahead of time.",56 people found this helpful

Nintendo Switch – OLED Model w/ Neon Red & Neon Blue Joy-Con,5.0,Worth it if you're a handheld player,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on December 28, 2021",Color: White | Style: Console,True,"This moderate upgrade of the Nintendo Switch is definitely worth spending an extra $50 to get if you are already in the market for a new Switch. The most important question though, is if it's worth it for the people who already own a Switch. This depends a lot on personal preference as well as how old your current switch is (and if you own the original HAC001 from 2017-2019 or the V2 that released in late summer of 2019). I mostly play in handheld mode because that is what this console excels at, for playing on a TV/Monitor, there are plenty of better options.So what do you get with this OLED model? You get a larger screen that is OLED instead of IPS LCD. This is the type of screen that most iPhones have used since 2017 (and all of them use it now except for the SE2). You get a better contrast ratio, meaning deeper blacks and brighter colors/whites. There is no HDR support like Dolby Vision or HDR10, but it still looks leagues better than all the other Switch models. The smaller borders around the screen make the device look more modern and it's the size they should have gone with from the beginning (even if the logistics of using OLED wasn't feasible in 2017). There is also improved speakers, they do sound better and make the games your playing sound larger and more immersive. It's not as big of a difference as the new screen is to the old screen, but it's still a good thing to include.Another new features is a better kickstand that is more like that of a Surface Pro tablet, allowing the Switch to be able to lean all the way back and be much more sturdy while doing so. This isn't really important unless you play in tabletop mode, but this is more realistic of a way to use this console with the screen being just that much bigger, I could see myself using a Pro controller and sitting the switch down for certain types of games.The last difference here is the dock, which has a built in Ethernet port, which you should really use if you have the option to go wired. Unlike in the previous model ""regular Switch"", a wired connection is basically twice as fast as using standard WiFI, before it was only about 1.5x as fast. It still is unfortunate that you cannot achieve 100Mbps download speeds, but 60-65 is better than the 40-45 I was getting on my older model.If I had to oversimplify who should buy the OLED model, I would say that these two types of people should buy the OLED (even if they already have a Switch Lite or V2) It would be: techie people who are nerdy about their tech and want the best they can get (even when they don't need it), and serious gamers who sink hundreds and hundreds of hours into playing the Switch in handheld mode.Also, I don’t know that we need to specify this anymore because the switch OLED has largely been in stock since early January. But I did not and would not pay one penny more than $350 (plus tax) for this console. I think it’s worth that price if you love Nintendo characters/games, but I don’t think the hardware is worth more than $400 and the tax gets it pretty close to that.",131 people found this helpful

It simply does not offer that much in meaningful upgrades. But if you’re looking at getting this or the base model, get this. For only $50 dollars more, you get many significant upgrades over the base model of the switch, such as reinforced joycon rails, an actual fully adjustable kickstand instead of the wimpy one that always breaks on the base model, and a nice upgrade to the internal storage. Oh and of course the new bigger oled screen with true blacks. In conclusion, this new model makes the base switch feel like a $100 android tablet in comparison.",10 people found this helpful

However, this Christmas I received an OLED (normal edition) so I figured 'why not return it and get the Splatoon one'? I do not regret this decision at all, this is the most gorgeous design out of all of the limited consoles in my opinion. I read the reviews before purchasing and saw a couple of comments mentioning their switch was not English, and neither was mine, but I was prepared for that and it causes no issues; you just might have to buy another charger/adapter if you don't already own one. The switch is not region locked so no sweat. I haven't used it for long but I'm already in love and definitely recommend it if you're thinking of getting an OLED.",8 people found this helpful

Nintendo Switch – OLED Model w/ Neon Red & Neon Blue Joy-Con,5.0,It's NINTENDO!,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on May 16, 2022",Color: White | Style: Console,True,"I absolutely love the product. I had a spat when I got it. It didn't have a charger for the dock. However talking to Amazon Support they corrected it for me and I was able to get a charger off the store. With the Switch Oled, you not only are able to have a bit more vibrant colors, but the system itself has great battery life. I had the original switch and this is leagues better. I literally had the switch in my bed for 4 days playing off and on and within those 4 days the battery went as low as 30% and the charging happens fairly quick, not to mention you can dock it and play it while it charges on a big screen tv.SO IF YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT A SWITCH IS OR HOW IT WORKS LET ME EXPLAIN THE DIFFERENCES1. theres 3 versions- Switch (original one with a dock and can be played on a tv w/ a smaller screen than Oled)- Switch lite (the hand held version with no dock and can't be played on a tv)- Switch Oled (newest one, vibrant colors on screen, Larger screen, and has a tv dock)2. Games- The switch is one of the better nintendo systems that have more 3rd party games on it, although the selections are smaller than the Playstation and Xbox, the switch gives you versatility to not only bring it with you on the go to play games, it gives you the action to play with multiple people by separating the joy cons (controllers) and with that you can use each one sideways as a controller allowing two people to play and with multiple joy cons you can have a session of multiple people.-It has both digital and cartridge games. the cartridge games are very small, and they also have a fast install time. The games are very fun to play and have lots of multiplayer options. No full VoIP on the system but they have an app for cellphones to use.- the store usually has great deals on titles as most of the cartridge games cost full price or barely have anything discounted at places like Target, Walmart or Gamestop.3. How they work (docked versions)- a docked Switch connects to the TV, it allows the device to charge and you can play games as it charges on the dock.- it has a tabletop mode where you can play games on the screen as a tv. In other words you can still use a controller but have the tablet part standing upwards as you use a full controller to play on it.- Handheld is where the Joy cons are attached to the tablet and you use it like a handheld or similar to a gameboy or something in that way.Personally it's worth the money and Nintendo has usually very good systems that last a long time. Although they might not be the best graphically they have some fun family friendly first party games.",129 people found this helpful

However, we did note that the delivery driver was very careful when they placed it at our doorstep. The switch box had no signs of any rough handling and everything inside was perfect.

The games on this POS have made me want to throw this console at the wall so many times that I have become majorly concerned for my mental health.Trash graphics, uncustomizable system, many games lack the basic options that today's games have like camera invert controls, and wow, their games are basic asf. I am so frustrated with this purchase that I have rage—tweeted to Nintendo with earth-scorching complaints so many times that I'm surprised that they haven't blocked me.Look.... I livestream all the time, and every time I'm gaming on my Livestream with a Nintendo Switch, no one wants to watch. SERIOUSLY, NO ONE GOVES A FLYING CRAP ABOUT A NINTENDO SWITCH LIVESTREAM. I have 0 viewers when streaming with a Switch. I WISH I WAS JOKING.I don't understand how people keep saying this is a great gaming console, because it's not. It's trash and it's getting returned for a refund. I bought a PS5, Xbox Series S, and now this POS Nintendo Switch, and after my experience with all of these systems, I can only recommend that people stay VERY far away from a Nintendo Switch. I can't even stand this thing.I WOULD NEVER LET MY KID OWN A NINTENDO SWITCH, THIS IS ABSOLUTELY NUTS. What an overpriced POS. My suggested retail value of a Nintendo Switch is no more than 50 bucks, that's how awful of an experience this console gives its fans.Their controllers are complete trash too. It comes with this joycon handheld gaming controller connector thing, and you can't even plug your headphones into it. If you're a wired headphones user like me, you will be so outraged that your wired headphones absolutely have to be plugged into the Switch itself. Not to mention that the right controller struggles to stay synced to the console when disconnected from the console, and causes uncontrollable stick drift. I like gaming with wired controllers for peak performance, and I'm so unimpressed with the Switch controllers. When you hold the Switch with one hand for a second, you can feel the weight of the console might break the joycon controllers off of the Switch itself, it's that flimsy of a connection.The shipping was fast, but this was a terrible investment. A complete waste of money. And they're charging 60 bucks for these trash games too? I am baffled at how more people aren't complaining about what this company is getting away with. This is highway robbery! I am never buying a Nintendo product ever again. 👎🏻 Did I mention that the games are stupid? 🤢 When you buy this piece of junk, you're basically paying for a touch screen console that still needs the controller to operate the system and games, even though it's touch screen.For the price of the 3 games I bought and system itself, I could have purchased an Xbox Series X instead and not had all these problems. This is a system for kids, not for someone who's trying to take their livestream career seriously. This console is a joke and I do not recommend. 0 stars if I could.",

Nintendo Switch – OLED Model w/ Neon Red & Neon Blue Joy-Con,3.0,love it but im questioning support for the systems,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on November 26, 2022",Color: White | Style: Console,True,I love the idea of portable gaming and have not played video games in 20 years. I bought  Doom eternal as it used to be one of my favorite games as a kid.1) downloading games : I dont like this idea as its not transferable for another person in your household to just play at their leisure unless they want to completely under your login with their own separate profile form their Nintendo account. This idea is a huge fail to me. your profile and gaming experience/ progress should be completely clouded and seamless.how nice would it be to just log in on any switch and have your stuff ready to go as long as they had the same games. in my opinion they missed big on this.2. The support for these games are lacking. there are software crashes and no one seems to be able to help with logging the crashes and actually patch fixing the bugs. so i have a downloaded game that i spend 3 hours playing a master level that crashes at the end of that level. I have no saved progress and am forced to start all over. what a crappy experience when you play games as an adult to relax.3. the games are extrodinarily expensive. i am unimpressed with the price and once again if you download these games there is almost zero chance everyone in a household with separate consoles can enjoy the game to its fullest. they are going to want to save their progress on their own console. big thumbs down.4. the oled is great for using with a monitor or by standalone with a separate controller. holding it and using joycons is too big imo for someone with even large hands. they are so far away for a heaving controlling game like doom eternal.5. the speed is a little slow for high pace games and would have liked it to handle 120fpsfor the price i can only recommend if you plan on having a mostly mobile gaming experience as the price is not competitive with larger fixed gaming platforms for the reasons listed above.,10 people found this helpful

Nintendo Switch – OLED Model w/ Neon Red & Neon Blue Joy-Con,4.0,VERY nice… but essential?,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on September 1, 2022",Color: Neon Blue and Red | Style: Console,True,"I’ve owned a Switch since launch and, I knew I’d eventually pick up an OLED model, even though it’s unnecessary. If you don’t own a Switch but plan to get one, this is certainly the model to get. The bigger screen is nice; it’s more noticeable than you might think, though it’s not mind blowing. The extra battery life is a big plus, even though that too, is considered to be a minor upgrade by many.Aside from those two things, the placement of some ports were moved on the dock, but that’s about it. Everything else is unchanged. The upgrades pertain mostly to gamers who primarily use their Switch in handheld mode. If you use your Switch docked most of the time, there’s no need for this hardware half-step at all.That said though, if you don’t already own a Switch and are in the market for one, this is the model you’ll want. The bigger, cleaner screen and longer battery life are worth the extra cash.",30 people found this helpful

Nintendo Switch – OLED Model w/ Neon Red & Neon Blue Joy-Con,5.0,The coolest most versatile console ever!,"Reviewed in the United States on September 26, 2022",Color: White | Style: Console,True,"When I was a kid, my friend had the first Gameboy and he let me borrow it once so I could play Link's Awakening. I would fantasize about taking games and playing with them on trips. I once asked my dad who was a truck driver if we could hook up my NES on the tv that was in the sleeper so I could play when he would take me on long trips with him during the summer, but we didn't have the right tech to make it happen. Fast forward...I purchased a Switch because I was mesmerized by Breath of the Wild after trying it out in a store. I still can't believe how cool it is to have a console hooked up to a tv and then switch it out to become a portable system. It's my little kid self's dream come true!Now, the upgraded OLED Switch is so nice!

It's thin plastic and I'm afraid to break it each time when I'm trying to open itCharger looks like a transformer and needed to use an additional adapter and the original package was opened by the seller to put that adapter to the package (that is not expected to receive an already repackaged box).The only thing that is improved on oled model is the big oled laminated display.,

Nintendo Switch – OLED Model w/ Neon Red & Neon Blue Joy-Con,5.0,"Unexpectedly spectacular, underrated upgrade from original","Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on June 23, 2022",Color: White | Style: Console,True,"my original switch was collecting some dust in docked mode and I figured I'd give this one a shot with some rewards points i had saved up.I picked it up, transferred my save data to it and played some games that i was familiar with and the handheld experience absolutely shocked me.  I heard that the display wasn't that much of an upgrade over the original, but I strongly disagree.The display is about a half inch larger all around, with almost no bezel at all.  The colors that the OLED display can produce are absolutely phenomenal.  the colors in every game are crisp and bright. dark shadows in game are deep and rich and everything intended to glow in a game looks incredibly lively.Another subtle but superb upgrade is the console's kickstand. with the OLED version, it spans the length of the console (minus joycons) and it's more akin the the weird ""fluid hinge"" used in the Microsoft surface line of computer tablets.  it feels super sturdy and very refined compared to the original dinky kickstand.unironically, this upgrade was the tipping point that made me go from a ""docked mode only"" preference to almost entirely handheld mode.  it totally sold me with the superior handheld gaming experience over the original.  500% recommend it, especially if you haven't gotten a switch yet or you're looking to brush the dust off your docked original switch, you'll never look back.",17 people found this helpful

I was honestly hoping for a little more value with the system, why it does not come with they joycon control toppers makes no sense to me, but entertainment  with this device is really meant for gaming. Pricing of games for the Switch seems pretty high to me, and as you really only have two options for purchasing games (physical card or software download) most options are available through the Nintendo E-store but pricing there is high as well. Nintendo also offers a Switch online service which will allow user to purchase the use of emulated cloud gaming for the NES, SNES, N64, and Sega Genesis (highly recommend the family plan for people who buy their kids this product). Circling back to my one major concern, value, the Switch only offers Hulu as a streaming service. Yikes….why?!?! Its really beyond me.",5 people found this helpful

Nintendo Switch – OLED Model w/ Neon Red & Neon Blue Joy-Con,5.0,Economics meets the Switch,"Reviewed in the United States on November 22, 2021",Color: White | Style: Console,True,"A note first. The sad reality here is that Nintendo did not make enough units to meet initial demand. This seems to be a pattern with Nintendo (don't get me started on Amiibos...) but these are nonetheless the facts on the ground. Since supply is far behind demand, there are those who will sell their units at a premium. As such, the question here is if you're willing to purchase a $350 msrp unit with a premium added to compensate for not getting a preorder or such. I look at it as how much am I willing to pay for not being able to get a unit at launch and add that to the $350 base price.This said, the new Switch certainly does add $50 of value over the previous model for mobile users. The screen is...fantastic. Extra memory is also appreciated though stock onboard memory is still sparse (my first add here was not a game, but a 512GB micro SD card...). The kickstand is what it should have been in the beginning.All this said, if you're using this mainly hooked to a TV, you won't see much difference between this and the previous version. But if you use this primarily as a mobile device...yeah, it's got chops.This leaves the frank question of what you're willing to pay. Frankly I don't blame the ""scalpers"" but rather Nintendo. I'm cynical enough to think Nintendo created this shortage just as they do with so many other things...they could have quadrupled initial production but chose not to do so. Blame them, not third parties who are only following the laws of economics.",5 people found this helpful

This switch oled is a smart system that can take a trip with you my only gripe is I wished nintendo thought about a smaller travel charger and battery pack for the road.

Also unfortunately you cannot use Bluetooth headsets with the switch but you can use old-school plugin wired headsets and sounds clean and clear. With an innovative system you've thought that in game chats would be cool and used with they're system. The alternative is a USB headset with a dongle using radio signal and a port meanwhile the Bluetooth is limited. I can connect this to a Bluetooth speaker with no lag but wish ninentdo would've been smart to make a compatible ear headset for online game chat....This system is limited and there's one theme forever, hell my 3ds still has better backround themes and they discontinued the 3ds store.

Nintendo Switch – OLED Model w/ Neon Red & Neon Blue Joy-Con,5.0,Best Gaming System Fir Kids and Adults!,"Reviewed in the United States on April 4, 2022",Color: White | Style: Console,True,"First off this gaming system isn’t an extreme power house like the PS5 or Series X but it’s till up there. We have had the Switch Lites and Original 6.2” Switch and we just upgraded to the OLED’s. This was an awesome upgrade.The screen is one of the biggest improvements. The original switches weren’t that bright, and the graphics didn’t look that good. The OLED has a larger display that is brighter, the graphics look way better and easier on the eyes on handheld mode.The OLED’s new kickstand in the back is a way better improvement. No more little baby kickstand that barely held the Switch up and easily broke off.The new 9 hour battery on the OLED is awesome. We get over 3 hours more of playtime before needing to get charged is a big help especially with kids.The OLED’s new dock is a big improvement. The cords are easily secured better and it finally had Ethernet built in. No more Nintendo LAN adapters which throttled the amount of Ethernet speed the switch got.At the end of the day my kids still love their PS5 and Series X but their OLED Switches are their go to system. Plus it’s great being able to get destroyed by your kids playing Mario Kart or Mario Party games :)We highly recommend this Switch OLED over all previous Switch versions and models. The extra $50 is worth the better upgrades from the original Switch.",2 people found this helpful

Nintendo Switch – OLED Model w/ Neon Red & Neon Blue Joy-Con,2.0,DO NOT BUY IF YOU ARE IN THE U.S!!! Please read!!,"Reviewed in the United States on March 26, 2023",Color: White | Style: Console,True,"The exterior brown box that the OLED shipped in was in perfect condition BUT the actual Nintendo box had a pretty bad bruise on the corner of it which tells me that before the OLED even made it into the brown packaging box it was not handled with care. BUT inside of the Nintendo box, the OLED itself was fine nothing was scratched or damaged or anything of the sort and everything was in the box that's supposed to be in the box. But the listing of the switch does not say anywhere that is it NOT U.S. model. So when I received it I could not connect the OLED to my home wifi or any wifi for that matter and I know that I was trying to connect it correctly because I used the first model switch to connect to my wifi and it worked perfectly and I also used other devices that I had and they connected perfectly. After messing with it for hours I didn't even make it past the setup screen because I needed the OLED to connect to my wifi in order to transfer my game data from the 1st gen switch. So I packaged it back up and the very next day I returned it. This happened on the 24th of March 2023 and I just tracked my return a couple of hours ago and unfortunately, it won't even make it to the warehouse until the 29th...so yea. I was really hoping to get a full refund by the time I go on vacation at the beginning of April but oh well! lesson learned. if your in the U.S please spare yourself the time, and money and DO NOT BUY the OLED from here. as soon as I get the refund I am going to best buy.",2 people found this helpful

Controller design to be used as individual controllers or use two controllers, one in each hand is a brilliant idea....just poorly executed.  Docking the individual controllers onto the dual controller or installing the tether straps is awkward.  I accidently installed backwards and had to nearly break the controller to back the tether straps off.  Also sliding the controller onto a charging dock is not smooth have to line up just perfectly.

The vivid colors look amazing on games like MK8 and Animal Crossing, and I enjoy it so much. If you prefer to play in handheld mode, I definitely recommend getting a Switch Oled!

The screen is bright and the colors are vibrant, with inky dark blacks with the OLED panel. The kickstand has been greatly re-engineered, almost OVER-engineered. The Ethernet jack is a nice touch as wellThis model in particular features design elements inspired by Splatoon 3, which is one of my favorite series in all of existence. One has to take extra care of a unit like this, as you are unlikely to get an identical joycon back should they need repairs. I would definitely recommend doing whatever repairs yourself that you can. Stick drift and broken latches are actually fairly cheap and simple fixes, just fiddly.Overall, if you're in the market for a new Switch for whatever reason, you can't go wrong with this one for a paltry $50 more",12 people found this helpful

Nintendo Switch – OLED Model w/ Neon Red & Neon Blue Joy-Con,5.0,Vast Improvement for Handheld Players,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on January 9, 2022",Color: White | Style: Console,True,"It’s hard to show in pictures how beautiful the screen on this Nintendo Switch is. You have to see it for yourself in person. If you’re reading this, I’m going to assume you already own a switch or switch lite. I happened to own a Og day 1 Nintendo switch and a switch lite, and I knew I wanted this OLED switch the minute they announced it. OLED screens are a technical marvel and are truly beautiful. I like many others am a little disappointed that the switch didn’t get a new processor for better performance but I am still happy with my purchase. The screen alone makes all the games look beautiful. Colors are vivid and contrast is amazing. When you play it in a dark room, the screen looks like it’s off when a black scene is displayed. Besides the new screen, there isn’t a whole lot new with this switch, the dock was improved a little along with the kickstand on the back. That is also a welcome update as the old models always tended to fall over because the kickstand was weak and small. Games still load a little slow, when compared to phones and newer consoles, so don’t expect a speed increase. It comes with the same power adapter and joycon grip as before. Would I recommend this? Yes and No. if you love your Nintendo switch and want the new beautiful screen, then I think you’ll be very happy buying it. If you’re ok with the screen quality of the older models and want to save money, then don’t rush out and buy it. Not much has changed. If you’re on the fence, try to get your hands on one to see the display in person.",3 people found this helpful

I mean, obviously you'd only go for this model if you're a pretty hard-core Splatoon fan, and all of the aesthetic stuff is fantastic for a fan. But there are small differences between the OLED model from the base Switch model that don't seem to be brought up in marketing. Yes, the handheld screen is bigger and looks great, but the entire model feels sturdier, too. The joycon click feels solid and secure. The attached joycon straps work on either side (so no accidentally getting them stuck, anymore!). Definitely more worth the extra $50 than I was expecting.",4 people found this helpful

Bought it completely on accident while buying something else for my house and said ""You know what? I deserve something nice anyway.""As soon as I pulled it out of the box I was over the moon. The large OLED display delivers even better than promised, with smooth graphics, crisp visuals, and vibrant colors. The fan is quiet, it has an impressive amount of storage space compared to older models, and the dock has a LAN port, which is a feature that's new for the Switch.Whether you already own a Switch or not, this is a FANTASTIC game system.

Nintendo Switch – OLED Model w/ Neon Red & Neon Blue Joy-Con,5.0,An improvement over the original,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on December 31, 2021",Color: White | Style: Console,True,"My review is based on mostly the consoles handheld function. I own the original Switch from it's launch date and have used it almost daily since, where nearly all of the hours spent playing were in handheld. Now that these OLED models are back in stock, I finally managed to get it without having to be preyed upon by scalpers.I would not outright recommend anyone with the original Switch version (with dock) to upgrade if you don't really play in handheld much and are considered about the price. Whatever differences you'd experience with the new dock is going to be minimal. You'd already have worked around any grievances by now with the original.For everyone else though, it's a notably different experience to play with a larger screen. The colors are absolutely more vibrant with the OLED screen. Sound is a little better than the original and the battery is a little more improved as well. That pitiful little kick stand the original has is replaced by a larger full length one. It's very nice by comparison.As for the infamous Joy Con drift, I have zero doubts it'll eventually happen. Nintendo hasn't exactly been on the ball about that and it's allegedly a problem that all modern controllers for consoles are facing (e.g. PS5, Xbox, etc). Having had experience replacing the analog stick with the old controllers, which is a surprisingly simple task, I'm not really considering that in this reviews score. If it happens within the next year or so though, then yeah that's a problem.",5 people found this helpful

Nintendo Switch – OLED Model w/ Neon Red & Neon Blue Joy-Con,5.0,NINTENDO Forever,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on June 25, 2022",Color: Neon Blue and Red | Style: Console,True,"This is the Nintendo Switch OLED, as reviews by a 44 year old kid.The portable screen resolution is superb.  The controls are easy, lightweight, and durable.  The transition from handheld device to docking station and vice versa works like magic.  The docking station has three ports, HDMI, power, and ethernet.Booting up, updates, processor speeds are good.  If you buy games, these are tiny SD cards.  There are no CD or DVD slots on these consoles.  However, video games are very cheap via the Nintendo store.Also, if you sign up for Nintendo online service, you receive A LOT of games to play, from Super Mario, Excite Bike, Punch Out, all the way up to Nintendo 64 games.This is a very fun game console to have.  This is guaranteed to be fun for the entire family.",2 people found this helpful

Nintendo Switch – OLED Model w/ Neon Red & Neon Blue Joy-Con,5.0,So far so good!,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on April 22, 2022",Color: Neon Blue and Red | Style: Console,True,"I bought two of these. One for me and one for my mother. So far we’re very happy with them. Obviously having the ability to play on the TV is a big upgrade over our previous Switch Lites. Not to mention the OLED screen makes handheld gaming way easier on the eyes in my opinion. I also recommend the Pro Controller. System sound is also much better than on the Lite or on the original Switch. Exercise caution to avoid screen burn in. Do not leave powered on the same motionless screen for hours at a time to best avoid screen damage. Am planning to buy another for my younger brother as a birthday gift in a couple months. If you already have the original switch, I wouldn’t say the OLED model is a must have by any means, I don’t think it’s worth it to buy it for minimal upgrades over the original. Then again, worth is a personal outlook, and the upgrade could be very much worth it to you. Overall I would recommend to first time Switch players.",

Nintendo Switch – OLED Model w/ Neon Red & Neon Blue Joy-Con,2.0,I guess I wasn't meant to get a new switch.,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on March 6, 2023",Color: White | Style: Console,True,Apparently when you want to buy a new switch Amazon wants to send you their dirty hand me down consoles instead... always fun touching strangers dirty controllers.  After cleanining the console some I noticed a bunch of scratches on the back and one on the screen itself which isn't terrible but enough to be noticable.  Battery was dead so I had to wait awhile to get an initial charge on the switch to even try and do anything with it... fine whatever... finally get it to turn on and find someone's old account on here with my favorite thing ever... parental controls!  *smh*  Now I get to figure out how to reset a pin on a device that should have been new.  Yay for learning I guess.  Cost me .50 more and a bit of a headache but I finally got the pin reset and can now do something with the console.  I thought about playing some of the games left on the system but decided against it seeing as I don't want these people getting credit for my hard work.  Found the system restore and now I'm waiting another half an hour to clean off everyones garbage so I can put my own on there.... Honestly if I wanted a headache and someone else's hand me down switch I would have paid the $50.50 smaller price tag to get one... but at least I learned something I suppose and the system seems to work... if you can get past that scratch in the screen.,One person found this helpful

But Square/Enix is on board real strong, and if your a F@rtnite Tard well that's available for your wanky ass too. So basically it's not bad but it's not great either.",2 people found this helpful
Nintendo Switch – OLED Model w/ Neon Red & Neon Blue Joy-Con,2.0,Overpriced games/accessories + crappy hardware,"Reviewed in the United States on February 26, 2023",Color: Neon Blue and Red | Style: Console,True,"Decently fun in the car. Kind of mediocre any other time. It's ridiculous how expensive games are on this console. I really only wanted Smash Bros and the new Zelda game. To unlock everyone in Smash Bros you have to buy like 3 $25 fighter packs beyond the $50-$60 you paid for the game. The new zelda is now going to be $70 likely plus $30-$40 more for the expansion packs. With any games that aren't nintendo only you can usually get the same game on PC for like half the price with better controls.I can honestly say I prefer our Wii U over our Switch on the TV. The Wii U is a blast and was a lot cheaper. The switch does however have some pros in portability and the OLED screen looks pretty good for handheld mode, but I'd say it's not really worth getting one until Nintendo releases their new console and the price for a used one goes down in a year or two.Fairly unimpressive yet plenty expensive games, super expensive accessories, unimpressive hardware, we've had ours for what? A month or two and it's already showing some wear on the back from where our hands rested while playing. It's a cool idea and I'd wanted one for a long time, but I can honestly say I've been pretty disappointed. It's pretty much a wonky DS that everything is overpriced on.",

The screen has 50% larger & thinner bezels. It’s also made some changes on the top buttons. Better kickstand to hold on without dropping it. Improve speakers to sound more louder on portable mode. The OLED Screen has more brightness & colorful when you play all you’re switch games. No worries on the battery life. Because is extended more life. Performance is still the same, but there’s some future updates that would make more improved. It comes with a better Dock. They redesign the Dock & added some Ethernet for better online. The Dock has some changes. It’s also it could update the Dock. But it’s only the newer Dock, not the old Dock. No changes on the JoyCons which is still the same.This Switch it’s another revision for portables only. This is a must buy.

Nintendo Switch – OLED Model w/ Neon Red & Neon Blue Joy-Con,5.0,Small but mighty addition to my white console collection,"Reviewed in the United States on November 9, 2021",Color: White | Style: Console,True,"This is my first Switch. I decided to add Switch Oled to my white PSOne / PS2 / PS3 / PS4 / PS5 console collection, which I expand every Xmas. It fits right in. The console is great for kids, to play platformers and indie games, which I never play on my PlayStations but want to play on the Switch for some reason. Go figure. I had to expand the storage to 1Tb (64Gb is only enough for 4-5 big games - that’s it), bought a grip, a case and a screen protector + pro controller. All those bells and whistles cost as much as the console itself, so be prepared to spend quite a bit more after you have purchased the console itself. Thank goodness there are 75%+ off digital games sales at the moment. Once you get a dozen of games and 5-6 Nintendo classics, which almost never go on sale, the total cost will quickly add up to about $1000. Not sure I would buy it if I already had a regular Switch, but as the 1st Switch it is a no-brainer. It’s a lot of fun and joy in a tiny little package!",10 people found this helpful

It's round edges are aesthetically pleasing. The fact it has a built in ethernet cord is a game changer.

I play in mostly handheld mode, never docked.When I heard that Nintendo was going to release an updated model, aimed at handheld players, I was all over it.First things first, do not pay scalper pricing. This thing is WORTH $350, but not anymore.Secondly, the screen on this thing is amazing. While it is not that much bigger on paper, but it looks alot bigger in person. The colors are 150% better than the original's screen also. When I first got it, I was popping in games and just looking at how much better they look. The battery life is also significantly better.If you are manly a handheld player and have a launch switch, I would say UPGRADE!

This should have been $300 max and they should have dropped the other to $250-$270.  Bring on that Super Nintendo Switch or give me a new dock with an APU to boost the games performance.

Nintendo Switch – OLED Model w/ Neon Red & Neon Blue Joy-Con,5.0,Great if you don't have a Switch,"Reviewed in the United States on March 10, 2022",Color: White | Style: Console,True,"The screen is very sharp and the sound is clearer if you're a big music fan and can hear the differences. This is definitely a premium feeling product compared to the base model. The thing is, many people who don't play handheld mode or care about these minor improvements won't be satisfied with the minor quality of life changes if they already own a working Switch. For newcomers and those whose first run models are giving out, this is worth the extra 50. This puts the Switch Lite to shame. There's hardly a noticeable difference in portability. The Lite is more of an entry model.Another note, I recommend getting your Nintendo SwOLED from first party Amazon. There has been a scam going around where third parties will sell an original model in a SwOLED box.",

Nintendo Switch – OLED Model w/ Neon Red & Neon Blue Joy-Con,2.0,Not intended for normal hands,"Reviewed in the United States on October 25, 2022",Color: White | Style: Console,True,"I bought this unit because I own a Nintendo WII from years ago.  I saw an ad for a sports game that looked like a similar experience the WII used to provide.  Sadly the software engineers decided not to mirror game play that WII owners are used to, opting for slightly different trigger management making it hugely frustrating playing if you have a history with the older WII games.  Bad idea. I had hoped that other titles would be better but the general design of the system REQUIRES you manipulate the micro-sized controllers - either as attached to the tablet or held in a funky grip gadget, or as independent controllers.  If you have lived with any of the X-Box or PS systems you will immediately feel the lack of mass and claustrophobic button placement on the Nintendo controllers.  My adult fingers are squeezed against the right joy stick and the “B” button, the left controller has even less real estate.  I expect that devoting lots of time to a specific game would eventually train you to use the tiny controllers, but why would you.  Just put the money into a real system with normal hand sets.  I will be returning my Nintendo Switch OLED mainly because it is scaled and focused on children.  The system itself seems well made and performs as expected, it’s just too small.",

While limited to 720p resolution, the 7"" OLED display does not dissappoint. The display is vivid without being harsh and colors really pop adding etra dimension to games.  The onboard sound is improved over the original; however, I would suggest that you pair this with a set of wireless headphones for a truly great gaming experience on the go. I use a set of AirPods for this purpose and it sounds great!I would highly recommend this for portable gaming. If you are primarily using this as a docked system, I'm not sure that the updates warrant an upgrade from the original model, but the upgrades to the portable handheld gaming experience are truly worthwhile.",

Not only for the demands of todays games but also for better framerates and overall performance. The lags and stutters are still annoying both in games and on eshop, AAA games still either skip the Switch or it gets inferior cloud ports(as the hardware isnt strong enough to play most AAA 3rd party titles) which you cannot play portably which kills the purpose of a portable game console.

Nintendo Switch – OLED Model w/ Neon Red & Neon Blue Joy-Con,1.0,Charging doc left joystick wiggly,"Reviewed in the United States on December 19, 2022",Color: White | Style: Console,True,Charging doc doesn't work at all since I opened the box I have had the devices for less than a week. But on the 15th of December was when I wanted to purchase games on my new console I went to go get my device it was at 50 percent when I put it on the charing doc when I go get the device it's at 22% battery I tried different wall outlets same result. Also the right joystick is a bit more losse the the left joystick when attached to the console. I don't know why I'm having these issues when I didn't buy a used device I spent almost 400 dollars on a brand new device just for my stuff not to work properly.Btw for anyone looking to get an Nintendo switch i did some reseach when your charging doc is blinking rapidly when plugging the ac adapter it doesn't work AT ALL!! It's supposed to be a soild green light no blinking.But another thing is that when I was playing my game on the nintendo the background where there was nothing black as it is suppose to be but however when i started to play more i started to notice the black was beginning to be more green and was 3 hours into playing just imagine how it is now and also the device is very slow when loading the shop or anything most definitely a delayed respond and this was before I purchase any games just imagine now and even when I'm playing offline it's lagging on a game that isn't multi-player. Thanks Nintendo....🙄 overall my experience when using the device itself hasn't been the best but the games make up for its short comings alot of short coming might I add...😒😮‍💨,5 people found this helpful

However, when it comes to TV mode, the Nintendo Dock is a big failure in its design which awkwardly covers the whole console when it's docked.What is worse than the previous switch model, Nintendo is proving their anti-consumer way by changing the firmware for the OLED so that third-party docks won't work or usually max at 480p. There is not any reason to cap it at such resolution in the name of OLED. The third-party docks I have ( from bestbuy) work fine with the regular model but not the OLED. What's more interesting, using the OEM dock from the regular switch and OLED console has no problem at all.

Nintendo Switch – OLED Model w/ Neon Red & Neon Blue Joy-Con,1.0,Broke after two uses,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on October 24, 2022",Color: White | Style: Console,True,"Bought this as a gift for my 10 year old step son for his birthday.  After he used it twice, it would no longer charge. Return window closed two days before we realized it was broken. Contacted Nintendo and they wanted us to box it a specific way, including purchasing bubble wrap to mail it to them where they will have it at least three weeks. Contacted Amazon for a new system since it broke immediately and they refused to honor since it was passed the return window. I paid $350 for a new device and it immediately breaks. I don’t feel like I should be the one having to jump through the hoops with the manufacturer and be without the use of the product during that time. Amazon should send a new one and they should deal with Nintendo to get the other one fixed. I could understand if we were several months after purchase but it literally broke within two weeks. Amazon customer service would not allow me to speak to a supervisor and said the supervisor will contact me back. I have lots of meetings at work and don’t have time to just sit around waiting for a return phone call. They would not allow me to hold for the supervisor. Again, why am I the one having to waste my time to get a functional product that I have already paid for? I also will not purchase gifts early anymore if Amazon isn’t going to honor situations like this. I received it August 25th but his birthday wasn’t until September 13th.

The display should not be overlooked the tech behind it is unlike anything in the industry. For those unaware, when they say an OLED has the “blackest blacks” it’s 100% accurate. When there is a black pixel, it’s turned off rather than backlit like traditional LED panels. That combined with the technology of OLED and you have the most brilliant picture available. This display is absolutely incredible and combined with all the great titles Nintendo has, this is the best choice for fans who don’t have a Nintendo Switch.

I thought the switch would be a good alternative to something like a gameing laptop and its good for that but with everything you purchase between games or joycons or cases or controllers this system quickly becomes well over $500-$800 really quickly. The worst part is the nintendo ""membership"" now its nice if you want to play all the old games nintendo has ever released but im not into that i want to play the few games i want to enjoy. But unlike any other newer console ever release  nintendo can not and will not back up save data without this ""membership"" which is just really bad form. I put a old sd card into my switch just in case i needed the room later but little did i know switch automatically saved game files to the sd card with no option to change until after downloading to the sd card which i did not want. And one of my fears came true that the sd card is bad so it ended up corrupting all the game data on the switch and so far i have spent 4 hours download and moving and fixing and i font even think i will get my save data back.Edit: i yook another star away because i just discovered im not allowed to play online with friends unless i buy nintendos membership.

I would rate the value for hardware at five stars, but their idiotic draconian software restrictions are designed to punish owners who buy digital games, even though 99% of Switch games are digital-only. Even though I OWN and PERSONALLY PAID FOR all my downloaded games, and Nintendo has records of those purchases, I can't use them (not even exclusively) on this new OLED Switch unless it can find a wifi connection to verify ""if the game can be played"". If I have legitimately downloaded a game onto my own system, and it already verified it, why can't it believe that five minutes later I still have the rights to that game? It's idiotic and an unnecessary hassle that serves no purpose except to coerce people into buying multiple copies of a game they already paid for. For that, minus two stars, Nintendo.",9 people found this helpful

Upon inspection, the print on the package was in English, but the box said “Middle East/Southeast Asia.”  The owner’s manual was missing and the power cord was for a foreign country. In the box was an aftermarket adapter, but it was not for US outlets.  This was discovered when my daughter attempted to plug the device in and sparks came from the outlet. I attempted to initiate the return through the app and was forced into a chat box. I spoke to six different customer service representatives over the course of an hour in order to obtain a return shipping label.

Nintendo Switch – OLED Model w/ Neon Red & Neon Blue Joy-Con,2.0,Disappointed...,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on March 31, 2022",Color: White | Style: Console,True,"I have a V2, and I wanted to upgrade to an oled model. I play 99% of the time in handheld mode.Received mine yesterday, very happy. Started to play some games (Metro, BOTW, Metroid Dread, Diablo 2, etc..) to see the improvement. The screen (size, color, remanence) and the general feels in-hand feel prenium compared to the V2!The display has a greenish tint overall, but I also noticed big stains on both sides of the screen (in real life, it really looks like in the pictures). Even after fiddling with the brightness, auto ON/OFF and vivid/standard settings, still had the green stains. The image had also a ""sandy"" kind of look.Maybe some of these ""properties"" are inherent to OLED screens, but in my case it was too heavy to not notice. I could clearly see the difference in colors between the sides and the center. I liked this model, the size, the colors, the dock, the 64gb memory, but I am sad & disappointed because I wasn't expecting to receive a damaged product.I decided to return it and not order another one because I don't want to waste my time testing/returning devices.We'll see what will be released in 2023...",3 people found this helpful

Nintendo Switch – OLED Model w/ Neon Red & Neon Blue Joy-Con,2.0,some improvement. some stagnation. some detriment.,"Reviewed in the United States on March 2, 2022",Color: Neon Blue and Red | Style: Console,True,"improvement:larger OLED screenwired dockbetter kickstandstagnation:included Joy-Con Grip still doesn't chargewhich means if you use it you're constantly removing joycons to charge.this leads to additional avoidable wear and tear to the point that you just buy a dedicated pro controllerthis in turn means that the included Joy-Con Grip is not really used and is basically landfill trash.detriment:the game cart slot cover has been unnecessarily changed making it harder for older people or for gamers with some wrist dexterity difficulties to open it to replace cartridges.this is possibly intentional to steer people to ""lease"" digital games instead of buying to own physical copies.i bought this for a grandmother that already had a collection of carts from the original Switch that she would no longer be able to swap out. so i returned this and got her another present instead.looks like on its own Nintendo just doesn't learn about user experience and building/maintaining customer love.as long as it feels it that satisfies the critical mass it will gladly throw others under the bus.hopefully other products like Steam Deck will help it wake up and reevaluate its actions",4 people found this helpful

Nintendo Switch – OLED Model w/ Neon Red & Neon Blue Joy-Con,1.0,Very Disappointing - Never Buying A Nintendo System Again,"Reviewed in the United States on January 21, 2022",Color: White | Style: Console,True,"I waited for months to get this and had alerts set up on Honey when it was back in stock. We were waiting out for the 4K system but decided to cave on the OLED to play Bayonetta 3 and Pokemon games. Finally was able to order one at the retail price in early December as a late Christmas gift to the family. It was a massive mistake. Once the item arrived, it was in a damaged box (not Amazon but Switch itself). No big deal, it seemed fine. At first, I was having a hard time getting on our network. Then it started having issues playing Let's Go Eevee. I was ready to give up on it and said to start a return in mid-January.Feeling guilty and not wanting to get out during bad weather, I thought I would give it another try. About halfway through playing Lets Go Eevee, the joycons started to stop working randomly. It would do basic up and down, but not right and left, and some of the other buttons were randomly not working.I was about to start a warranty claim until I noticed on the website that part of its 'subscriber' features also takes your saves hostage. You have to pay to send your saves to a new system through their 'cloud' feature. Never had we had a game system do this. We decided to give up and start the return process again between the hardware issues and this. After this, I don't think I will ever buy a Nintendo system again.",11 people found this helpful

But parts of the screen have a green tint that's more pronounced at certain brightness levels, and darker grey-ish colors have a static fuzzy overlay at any brightness level. Seems like Nintendo sourced some leftover OLED screens with no QC for these and it shows, definitely not worth upgrading.They also covered the screen in a thin layer of plastic that scratches really easily. I understand why -- the Switch OLED is supposed to be kid friendly, and the plastic is supposed to keep any shattered glass contained if you drop it. But I don't take mine any further than the couch, and it already has a couple small but annoying scratches after less than two months, whereas my V2 didn't have any after two years.",7 people found this helpful

Nintendo Switch – OLED Model w/ Neon Red & Neon Blue Joy-Con,1.0,No warranty from Nintendo and avoid OLED.,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on October 22, 2022",Color: White | Style: Console,True,"The C input in the console quit working after 9 months. Amazon replaces within a year if you buy within a Window for Christmas but of course it’s sold out so I bought it in January. After an hour long chat I got the Nintendo warranty fine print.  If they determine it’s your fault you pay. If they can’t repair it they will send you an old one with scratches, etc. Asurion warranty was much better in that it provides for accidents. This was clearly a defect but Nintendo won’t own it. It’s a shame. My whole family has Switches and I have the only OLED. It’s newest but first to fail.

I’m a huge Nintendo fan, but I’m not waist of $400 on this piece of crap.  I’ll save it for new PS or XBOX.  I’m so let down on this.  Even going from the original 3DS to the NEW 3DS XL felt better.  How did Nintendo mess this one up.  Basically, here is the same dang switch remained.  You get a brighter color on the screen.  Who cares?  I can put it on my TV and do the same thing.  And then the games look like terrible on the switch because they are made for the new OLED.",7 people found this helpful

Nintendo Switch – OLED Model w/ Neon Red & Neon Blue Joy-Con,5.0,Looking For Fun? Look No Further,"Reviewed in the United States on March 27, 2023",Color: Splatoon | Style: Console,False,"The Nintendo Switch, in particular the OLED model, is arguably the best Nintendo system to date. With the ability to play NES, SNES, N64, GB & GBA via its subscription service along with a variety of first party titles (Mario Kart, Super Smash Bros, Zelda), there’s really no way to pick one up and not find something to do. Is it as powerful as a PS5 or an XBOX Series X? Nope. Where as they play games at a steady 60 frames per second, the switch plays games at half the rate at 30 frames. This detail may me little to you as since it’s not particularly easy to tell, especially on first party games. But when it comes to ports of big games like Skyrim or The Witcher 3, it runs them as well as it can but they’re significantly more fun on systems that can handle their hardware. It’s impressive that a portable system can play them at the cost of performance, though.If you’re looking for a video game console that you can play on the go and at home and you’re not focused on playing games at 60 FPS, the Switch OLED is without a doubt a great option. Its versatility, accessibility, and overall quality will help you make memories for years to come.",

My husband plays Xbox on our 75in TV and I like to sit on the couch next to him and play my own games. I had the animal crossing switch which I had been so excited about getting, so I thought about upgrading to the OLED for a long time before actually doing it. IT WAS WORTH IT! The screen is impressive. Beautiful, vibrant, and easy to see/read. Also, IT HAS BLUETOOTH! I didn't know that before buying it, so it was a welcome surprise. If you play a lot in handheld mode, I highly recommend the upgrade to OLED. So glad I did it!",

Nintendo Switch – OLED Model w/ Neon Red & Neon Blue Joy-Con,5.0,Great Product,"Reviewed in the United States on April 3, 2022",Color: White | Style: Console,False,"I find the Nintendo Switch a great product to buy.  Some reasons that drew me into buying such an expensive gaming console is because the Switch is portable, has lots of interesting games, and has a lot of cool features.First, the Nintendo swich is portable.  It is almost considered a handheld device.  I can play with the Switch on the couch, hook it up to my computer or television.  The possibilities are endless.  When I go on a trip, I can pack it up and take it with me.  I can’t really do that with the Xbox or the Playstation.  The Xbox and the Playstation have to be connected to the TV in order to play with it, not to mention all of the wires and plugs that have to be packed up.  It’s not convenient like the Nintendo Switch.  The new Switch has a battery life of 9 hours compared to the older models which was 6.5 hours. That’s almost 3 more hours per charge.  The screen is approximately 6.2 inches which is comfortable for my eyes so that they don't have to squint to look at the screen.  The detachable joy cons are really nice to have.  They are light and wrap around your wrist.  The switch is not like any gaming console out there.  It’s a one of a kind because it’s a gaming console that is portable and that can also hook up to your TV.  There is nothing else out there like it.Next, the Switch offers a wide variety of games from fighting games like Super Smash bros, racing games like Mario Kart, to building simulators like Minecraft.  They also have developed a wide variety of fantasy games like the Legend of Zelda.  My favorite game to play with my family is Mario Kart because it has different characters, challenges, race courses and cars to choose from. It’s very interactive so you feel like you are actually in the game yourself.  I can play it for hours because it is so addicting.Lastly,  the overall look of the Switch is just awesome.  The design is simple but comes in a variety of colors and themes.  You can buy different color joycons (controller) and a pro controller along with  different color cases to make the Switch your very own.  The choices are endless and are what caught my eyes.Overall at $299, I think the Nintendo Switch is a good buy.  It’s very portable, has a wide variety of games for the family and has a very sleek design.  I would recommend buying one if it is within your budget and you love to play games.",10 people found this helpful

Nintendo Switch – OLED Model w/ Neon Red & Neon Blue Joy-Con,5.0,51 year old Gamer Dad weighs in “Do not Fault the Switch because of Scalpers” Best Switch period.,"Reviewed in the United States on November 5, 2021",Color: White | Style: Console,False,"Thoughts of a 51 year old gamer dad.I wish people would stop faulting the system because of People’s Greed. The Switch isn’t at fault - it’s scalpers and resellers that use bots to buy up all the stock in a heartbeat and then resell at 2-5 times MSRP. The problem with the current Pre-Order system is merchants like Wally, Amazonian, Besties Buy, and others allow this practice to continue to happen. Your anger needs to be directed at them for not doing something to prevent this. Limiting sales of 1 per house hold, Address, or verified IP address would limit this but all these retailers seem either too dumb or just don’t care to enact it because they are selling their stock. This same issue has happened with PS5s and the newer Xbox’s too. However Tar-jaé 🎯 does limit their sales. Which is how I was able to get a system for my son and myself. One of each color. Anyway I didn’t want this to be the review of the purchase - because I understand peoples frustration, just they are taking their anger out on the product instead of the real reason that is upsetting them.As to the Switch OLED, it is by far the superior system. There is a premium feel to this new unit compared to the older version. For and extra $50 you are getting double memory space out of the box, a true glass OLED screen which makes your whole library of Switch games come back alive. There is no comparison….the OLED screen is stunningly beautiful. You can really tell on any game that has black on screen. Luigi’s Mansion, Metroid Dread, and any underground Mario level, and Breath of the Wild will simply take your breath away…again. Then the build quality is just incredible. The bezel on the front (what there is of it) is metal, the body length kick stand and side rails are all metal. So, Joy Cons not only lock into place but feel incredibly sturdy this time around. No Hamburglar “wobble wobble” - if you get that joke you’re my people.  A newer designed dock with has 4K upscaling built in? And the included HDMI cable is also 4K compatible this time around….those all inflate the cost of production so I can’t see that being a coincidence. Nintendo has plans to use those upgrades.  So all the complaints I’ve heard about the $50 price bump seem nonsensical. I’d honestly say it’s worth more then $350 but Nintendo did what it did to keep it at that price point - including scaling down the packaging this time around to save on cost where they could….which I would rather have more system and less cardboard.So when you can, and find these in the wild or back on retail shelves - Don’t line a scalpers pocket - you should definitely upgrade your system if you’re a Nintendo fan. I personally love the system and my son loves his. They were well worth the retail price.",5 people found this helpful

I had the first switch that came out until I gave it to my nephew because he was constantly wanting to play it and He ended up breaking it so I was like, here yah go kid… you get to keep my $300 console lmao. It was well worth the wait though! I’m liking the redesign, and I’m privy to both handheld and TV game play. It’s always best going into something  without having high expectations that people seem to have a lot these days of. That’s how disappointment is created imo. Honestly, I’ve got way more in my possession now than I ever thought with my old switch. I’m extremely pleased with the slight upgrade, the screen the size of the screen and the display is beautiful, it’s what I had expected with it being an OLED given my experience with OLED (a realistic expectation of course). I definitely give it 5 stars and will cherish this for years to come! If you’re looking for a better upgrade, you’re not going to find a console like this for $50 more than the original that came out before it. Buy it.",
Nintendo Switch – OLED Model w/ Neon Red & Neon Blue Joy-Con,5.0,A worthy upgrade for me,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on January 11, 2022",Color: White | Style: Console,False,"I have the original version 1. Then I also bought the Lite when it came out, but after a while I just felt like the screen was too small. I went back to my version 1 and was getting tired of picking it up to play it and finding the battery always needed charging. So I took a chance on this OLED and I'm finding the battery life is pretty much doubled. Other improvements:PROS:Much longer battery life via better power managementGlass screenBigger screen size/smaller bezelsColors look much more vivid and sharp, games look better than everMuch improved audio speakersMore memory (only 64GB, but still double the previous versions)Better kick standImproved dock, can now use a wired Internet connectionTighter Joycon connections to the consoleImproved WiFi receptionCONS:Same processorYou might also need new accessories to fit the slightly larger sizeOnly 4K on TV screenFramerate? Example: while Metroid Dread looks fantastic and is supposedly 60fps while playing, the framerate drops to 30fps in the faster cut scenes. It's pretty noticeable.OVERALL:The $350 price is steep for lacking 4K in handheld mode, no processor upgrade, minimal memory upgrade and the same framerate as previous versions, but there are the improvements to consider. Seems like another Nintendo wallet-grab release, but not a total teaser. In the end I'm very happy with the device. It's hard to recommend upgrading to the OLED from the previous V2 Switch, but as an upgrade from the V1 or the Lite, you might want to consider it after you factor in additional things like tax, shipping, extended warrantee, re-purchasing any accessories that don't accommodate the OLED's slightly lager size, and new screen protectors, before you decide if it's worth the final total to upgrade.",

I feel that they should've mentioned this somewhere in the marketing. The joysticks also aren't perfectly responsive and there is a noticeable, albeit small, reactionary delay when pressing buttons. They could improve it by giving it an actual 1080p HD screen and a higher refresh rate. The 60hz refresh rate feels like 30.

Nintendo Switch – OLED Model w/ Neon Red & Neon Blue Joy-Con,4.0,Switch 2.0? Yes & No,"Reviewed in the United States on November 28, 2021",Color: White | Style: Console,False,"Hard to believe 4 years ago, Nintendo really came back from the brink of despair with the release of the Nintendo Switch. The console took the concepts from the Wii & Wii U and made it the mainstream for gamers to enjoy their favorite video games at home & on-the-go. The hybrid console is definitely a game changer in fun. There also have been so many wonderful titles that also came around the bend with the Switch like The Legend Of Zelda: Breath Of The Wild, Super Mario Odyssey and Animal Crossing: New Horizons. The Switch also spawned other versions of the console like the handheld Switch Lite, which brought handheld gamers into the console line, with some bells & whistles a few years ago, with strong results. Now, Nintendo is taking the basic Switch hybrid and expanding it for handheld gamers young and old, with better results.The Nintendo Switch OLED brings in all the strong concepts of the original Switch and expanding it with a brighter OLED screen. The hybrid console may not be as unique as the original Switch, but takes it a step up for those that might not want to play the console outside of connecting it to the TV, with a brighter screen, a stronger battery life and a bigger memory and storage for your favorite Switch games like Yoshi's Crafted World and recent titles like Metroid Dread and Super Monkey Ball Banana Mania. Looking at the console and playing underrated games like Sonic Forces and Pac-Man 99 was a absolute joy and incredibly fun to behold on the hold and looked better than when hey were originally released.I found it to be a joy playing the Switch more in handheld mode here in this console, the screen looked much better and brighter, like it does on my TV. It feels good. You also have a few extra improvements here too such as a built-in stand so you can use it more in the underwhelming tabletop mode from before, which is a better joy while playing gems that you could not play in handheld mode like 1,2, Switch and Super Mario Party. It felt pristine and clean. The new and improved joy-cons work just as well as the original ones Nintendo made and feels neat and clean. I found them to be better for control and just easier to manage than the original ones. The new dock also steps up nicely, with a few flukes though. For myself, it might not be as tight as the original Switch dock, it feels a little looser, but when connected to the internet with ethernet, you get a stronger internet connection for downloading games, or streaming games with Switch Online. There are just a lot of improvements that take the original Switch and uniquely makes it a little better in the end that makes the games feel better than ever.But nevertheless, the Switch OLED has a few faults within it, and than is largely going to depend on the kind of Switch gamer you happen to be. For one, not all of the accessories are compatible to the Switch OLED. That shows with accessories and grips from third-party companies. So, you may need to upgrade in the end for some cases and peripherals. Also, if you are primarily playing the Switch in handheld mode only, you might not want to upgrade to the newer console, because it does not offer anything new to grab you and just stick with the Switch Lite. Also, it does not have a faster processor than the original Switch does, considered it was planned for the Switch Pro model, which intentionally was going to be planned with the OLED model and sadly because of the processor shortage that has effected tech companies world, you have the 2019 processor that was included with the remodeled 2019 version. Not that it is a bad thing to worry about, but for those that did get the 2019 revised original Switch model, you might not want to buy the Switch OLED model.When it does come down to the Switch OLED, it handles well in the very end and you mainly get what you paid for. Truthfully, the Switch OLED is not a model for everybody in the end, and that can be a the one blow with the system. If you have the 2017 model, and need to the upgrade to the Switch OLED because of a better battery life of extra memory for games, that would be a yes. If you own a Switch Lite and never had the fullest Switch experience with the original hybrid, that would also be a yes. However, if you bought the 2019 revised Switch model, you might want to go into the Switch OLED, because all you would be getting would be the better screen and you may want to wait for a newer more improved model of the Switch down the road. But with my experience with the Nintendo Switch OLED, I'm having a lot of fun with it, and playing more in handheld than what I had played the original Switch. I do recommend you play around with the Switch OLED and kick back and have a lot of fun with the next step up in the Switch hybrid legacy.Graphics: A-Sound: AControl: A-Fun & Enjoyment: B+ for solo play; B+ for multiplayerOverall: B+",2 people found this helpful

The wait was worth it. I truly love the big screen, the dock, the joy con colour, and kickstand. I compared with my friend's version 2 switch and I noticed the OLED is much faster. I was recommended to get the version 2 because it's cheaper. Sure, maybe there isn't much of an upgrade but I feel like it's better than version 2. The gameplay looks smoother and colorful. I also like how the switch comes with a protective screen installed instead of having to buy another. Don't buy from the scalpers. I'm so happy I was able to buy one.",2 people found this helpful

Nintendo Switch – OLED Model w/ Neon Red & Neon Blue Joy-Con,1.0,Faulty Joy-Con and disappointing service from Nintendo,"Reviewed in the United States on August 5, 2022",Color: White | Style: Console,False,"After only 2 weeks of owning this and very minimal use, especially to the button that isn't working, the down button on the D-pad for the switch requires 8x more force to activate than the rest of them, I put it on my scale and all the other buttons register when the scale reads around 100g, but the down button doesn't register until I press hard enough for the scale to read 800-1000g, which is just not acceptable for playing. So I got a faulty Joy-Con, not that big of a deal, but Nintendo's solution to the problem was to ask me to send my Joy-Con in for repair, so after only 2 weeks of owning it I'm going to have to wait another 2 weeks (not sure how long repair takes, just guessing) without being able to play it? This doesn't seem like a fair way to handle faulty products to me, so I'm giving this 1 star, I like the system, but it clearly can come with flaws, and then the service to resolve them is just so disappointing. So just be aware when buying this that if something goes wrong, you're not going to have a good time.",

Nintendo Switch – OLED Model w/ Neon Red & Neon Blue Joy-Con,5.0,Nintendo Oled Switch from Amazon Treasure Truck,"Reviewed in the United States on November 22, 2021",Color: White | Style: Console,True,"First, this is my second Nintendo Switch system.  My first is the Mario edition switch and it still functions well.  Despite only small incremental upgrades with the Oled version, here are my main reasons for the upgrade:1.  My eyes are getting old, so at a slightly larger clearer oled display, it helps with the visual in handheld mode.  With the original, I noticed that I tend to leave it docked and hardly used it as a handheld.2. Lots of reviews fail to mention that I can finally link my wireless bluetooth headphone.  That was sorely missing from my Mario edition Switch.  Headphones vastly improve handheld functioning and enjoyment.Nintendo Oled is not a next gen console, and I get that.  It just come with enough improvements for me to justify upgrading.  I am looking forward to going back into my library of games and replaying some of the old games I have, in handheld mode.  At $350 MSRP (please try not to purchase scalping prices), I recommend it as a buy.  I dare say safe and spend the extra cash on the oled version versus the switch lite edition.

I was very surprised that the controller with the screen actually IS the console. You just sit the console into a charger and it becomes a TV console. Mind blown. The box was surprisingly small, I guess because the console is so tiny. Very easy to set up and get running, although the annoying part was linking Nintendo accounts (theres two different types) from my 3DS XL and phone apps, and getting everything connected. Once done though, its super simple. Pleasantly surprised by the games available in the eshop. Lots of indie games and good games on sale for $1.99 and $4.99. Its a lot of the same indie games I see on Steam (PC), and I wasn't expecting that. No complaints so far.

Nintendo Switch – OLED Model w/ Neon Red & Neon Blue Joy-Con,5.0,If you have a lite or the first generation switch this is worth the upgrade,"Reviewed in the United States on January 9, 2022",Color: White | Style: Console,True,I am absolutely in love with the OLED. I had the original first generation switch and I liked it but the battery life and the sound volume was lacking to say the least. This upgrade is Amazing. I get easily 3 extra hours on it compared to the original switch and I no longer have to wear headphones to hear my game. Also that extra inch in the screen makes a huge difference. You would think it wouldn’t because it’s only an inch but it really does. Not having that black border around the screen is very nice and slick and the extra enteral storage is great!!! My younger brother had the second version of the switch that has a better battery and when you compare his to the OLED there’s not that big of a difference when it comes to the battery so unless you just absolutely want the bigger slicker screen it may not be worth the upgrade but if you do have the original like me it’s more than worth it.,5 people found this helpful
Nintendo Switch – OLED Model w/ Neon Red & Neon Blue Joy-Con,5.0,"Not worth buying if you already have a switch- otherwise, it's the one to get!","Reviewed in the United States on December 25, 2021",Color: White | Style: Console,True,"In short- it's a great console, but I wouldn't recommend it if you already have one and usually keep it docked. If you primarily use handheld mode or own a Lite, it might be worth the upgrade for you. If you're a first-time buyer, this is the one to get.Most of the hardware is identical to the previous revision, so I'll go over what matters:DESIGN: In addition to an overall much more modernized design, the whole device has a much better quality to it and feels sturdy in the hands. It's a much more premium console, both in look and feel.SCREEN: It's larger, brighter, and more vibrant. Putting it next to an original switch makes the old screen look dull and dated. The glass screen is covered in a layer of plastic, so make sure to pick up a screen protector.KICKSTAND: It feels sturdy and easily moves to whatever position you'd like. I've actually used it quite a lot more then I expected to. It's a great upgrade from the flimsy kickstand on the original switch.DOCK: It looks nicer and has an ethernet port. Not much else to it.OTHER: The internal storage is doubled to 64gb, which is always nice to see. The speakers also sound a bit better compared to the original console.In short- for people who prefer handheld mode, it's pretty nice.

It was super apparent when I had the OLED and my OG Switch side by side to transfer my profile and data over.

Nintendo Switch – OLED Model w/ Neon Red & Neon Blue Joy-Con,5.0,Awesome system.,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on August 7, 2022",Color: Neon Blue and Red | Style: Console,True,"Versatility defines this system and it rocks.  It doesn't boast the power of the bigger PS* or XBox* systems but the graphics are really good and the game writers are obviously pushing the available hardware to it's limits.  Games such as Zelda Breath of the Wild have scenes that cause the rendering hardware to stagger because they are so rich.  It's not a problem but rather a testament to the quality they are trying to offer.The magic of this system is being able to play the newer versions of games that you grew up with.  Seeing Zelda come to life after playing on 16-bit hardware is like watching Michael Bay bring the Transformers to life.  Truly amazing.The system can be used on a TV or as a portable handheld console and has a built-in stand for a table top mode.  You can play multiplayer both on a single system on the TV or by networking multiple consoles either over a local network or the internet for Play with remote friends.The game selection available is amazing.  There's not only new versions of your favorites but you can play the classics as well with a subscription that has a family pass option.The newer OLED model is definitely worth the extra few dollars if your on the fence.  We bought 2, one for each boy, and the only problem we're having is that you can only play games on a single console at a time unless you buy a 2nd chip.  This is mostly just an issue for single player games like Zelda when they become household favorites and everyone wants a turn.  Having effective parental controls provides a solution for that problem though.",2 people found this helpful

I got mine from best buy. The amazing screen on it is a great step up from the old. I was watching the old one that my friend plays and seeing the difference was incredible. It’s a huge step up as it’s way more vibrant and immersive, the sharp colours, and the amazing back stand give it a different feel than the old one. I’m so glad I waited to get the new OLED rather that get the first generation. Incredible running and amazing for handheld mode as well as when it’s docked. It’s great for travel and I use it all the time 10/10 would buy again.",

Nintendo Switch – OLED Model w/ Neon Red & Neon Blue Joy-Con,5.0,Awesome Platform,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on February 18, 2023",Color: Neon Blue and Red | Style: Console,True,"Awesome product.The Switch platform is a great solution for on the go life. I like that it is small enough to not take up too much real estate in my entertainment center.  The included dock for the joysticks is nice as it feels like a regular controller.  The buttons are a bit smaller than I'm used to and the button mapping is pretty opposite from Playstation which has been a small learning curve for me since I have not played a Nintendo system since the N64. The user menu is something new for me as well.The load speeds seem pretty fast however when using the Nintendo store the browser seems a slow. I really like that whatever game you were playing is readily available on the menu and you can go between game and menu quickly and easily.I don't believe Netflix can be viewed on the Switch but other services I think are available.I feel like the console should come with a screen protector as the original model's screen would scratch from the dock, so if you do not have one, be careful when re-docking.",

If you have a Switch though I wouldn't recommend this upgrade unless you play it a lot on the road. In mobile mode this thing is a huge upgrade in terms of visuals. The screen is bigger and even chaotic games like smash brothers look fantastic. The controls are basically the same as the Switch, so you can use your old joy pad if you have them or get a  new one. Overall if you mobile game with it, I would upgrade, or if you never had a switch before, highly recommend this. But if you have a switch and don't mobile game much, don't bother.",One person found this helpful

The OLED display is a significant improvement over the standard model, providing brighter, more vibrant colors and deeper blacks. The handheld mode is also a nice touch, allowing her to take the Switch with her on the go.In terms of gaming performance, the Switch has exceeded our expectations. The games run smoothly and look great on the OLED display. The included Joy-Con controllers are comfortable to hold and provide a good level of precision.The build quality of the Switch is also top-notch. It feels solid and well-constructed, and we have no concerns about it breaking or malfunctioning. The included dock is also a nice touch, allowing us to easily switch between handheld and TV modes.Overall, we are extremely satisfied with our purchase of the Nintendo Switch OLED model.

After turning the new switch oled on I realized I had nothing to worry about because it starts up in English! It plays any regional game as long as you set it to the region your from.

Doesn't seem like it, but it is well worth the $350 price tag. It is the premium version of then Nintendo Switch Lite. If you are primarily using in TV hook-up mode you won't get your money's worth stick with original switch. If you are using mostly in portable or semi-portable mode (ie using the unit's screen) it is well worth the money. The switch lite still has its place -- for the kids you don't entirely trust to be reasonably gentle with it, or not get it unit and/or account banned using hacked firmware for pirate ROMs. The cases for OLED switch aren't that great. The switch light can get tougher cases because no need to accommodate detachable joycons.",

Nintendo Switch – OLED Model w/ Neon Red & Neon Blue Joy-Con,5.0,Love it,"Reviewed in the United States on May 5, 2022",Color: White | Style: Console,True,"I definitely recommend third party joycons or a big grip case. This replaced my Lite that started drifting, the stock joycons are so uncomfortable, even compared to the lite without a grip case. I bought a case with just the little humps on the back like my lite grip case, but that didn't work well and got controller shaped joycons for $40 and couldn't be happier, the ones I got charge on and with the switch but also have individual batteries, they have LEDs around the sticks but I leave them off to save battery life. The system itself is exactly the same, the big screen helps my aging millennial eyes not need to squint. It's got more vibrant colors viola an option in the menu that comes automatically on, which imo makes some games look oversaturated, but most games looks great with it. The battery life is amazing compared to the Lite, feels almost double. As far as I know literally everything else is the same inside the console, games all run the same, the resolution is the same. So far in 3 months I've only played handheld which is the biggest downfall of the system, it's uncomfortable out of the box, it is 100% necessary to buy a grip case or controller shaped joycons.",One person found this helpful

Nintendo Switch – OLED Model w/ Neon Red & Neon Blue Joy-Con,5.0,Probably one of my favorite “console” purchases of the year,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on November 6, 2022",Color: Neon Blue and Red | Style: Console,True,"Wow, wow, wow. Well let’s start by saying. I’m a handheld kinda girl, but I love traditional console gaming as well. This year alone I’ve invested in the PS5, xbox series S, the steam deck and I still okay on my psvita that I’ve had for a few years. And man does the Nintendo really really compete. So let’s compare the switch to each of these consolesNintendo vs Ps5: playstation clearly has a lager game collection way more variety etc. It’s a big beautiful console that takes up a lot of space. But the graphics are nice. Ive had it for about a month and I think it’s fine. Ive played spider man, stray, cyberpunk and some other games similar to those. (Open world) it’s good. Now on my switch the biggest pro is. I can take it literally anywhere without the need for wifi as long as I have the cartridges. It’s a beautiful oled screen that comes with it, a large section of games and I call this a jrpg powerhouse. I only play my jrpgs handheld. Psvita, even using psremote play to play the final fantasy series which is a hassle if your wifi isn’t the most stable on the planet lol. A lot of jrpg games are about $20 cheaper on the switch than it is the steam deck so that’s a plus.  I guess all in all it can’t really be compared to the ps5 but I can say I’ve had my switch for a few days and have played on here more than I’ve played on the ps5 so far.Switch oled vs psvita: I’m one of the people without the oled vita’s so right off the rip the oled switches screen is 100x better, brighter, and more beautiful. Before the switch I used to play all types of jrpgs on my vita. The old final fantasy series (very gritty and doesn’t look thag good especially compared to the remasters on ps4/ switch/ps5 and steam deck.) all of my games on my vita was free so that was a plus. (I won’t get into that here though)😂 now I love my vita. Probably my top 3 favorite… consoles? But after playing the switch and compare the exact same games. The difference is night and day and I’m honestly really sad because it seems this may be my last year even picking up the vita as the switch is slowly taking over my attention.Also the screen is bigger so that’s a plus. Playing persona on the switch is way better than psvitaSwitch vs steam deck. Okay steam deck wins by a ballpark just due to the amount of games to choose for alone. I mean really, nearly your entire triple A steam library. BUT it’s so heavy, so bulky and I’m never ever taking out of the house just due to the price and how long I waited to get it. Plus it’s a handheld but portability isn’t really in the picture unless you take a huge bookbag with you everywhere you go lol. I love the steam deck. I play it all the time. The only things the switch has on the steam deck is portability, The oled screen, and the Nintendo library of course. You can’t play Zelda, Mario and nearly any Nintendo games on the deck. And as I stated above the JRPG games are cheaper on the switch than the deck. But steams notorious discounts can creep up on you and you can get a bunch of games for like $40 I love thag, Nintendo doesn’t have really many good discounts on games. And lastly for the deck. Man it gets loud as heck lol.Xbox about the same that I’d say for the ps5 but if my internet connection was more stable then cloud gaming probably would have beat the switch by a few points. This is just my personal experience. I like playing cloud gaming in the home (btw cloud gaming is a mobile xbox gamepass playing via internet connection on iOS devices, pc and android) so mobile video game service. The best out there and it’s only $15.00 a month. I like it for the home but for me the point of mobile gaming is being able to play anywhere. But public wifi at work, out shopping etc is not stable at all. So the switch wins in this category.For kids. By far I say the switch. Everytime I pick up the switch I wish I had a child of my own to share it with. If I had this when I was a kid, I would’ve been the happiest kid ever.For adults I say it depends on what you like. If you like nostalgia then absolutely yes. If you like portability yes✅ If you like playing cod, halo infinite, Miles morales, metro exodus etc. Console is way better for you. Even a steam deck by far.",3 people found this helpful
