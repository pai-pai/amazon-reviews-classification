"Acer 21.5 Inch Full HD (1920 x 1080) IPS Ultra-Thin Zero Frame Computer Monitor (HDMI & VGA Port), SB220Q bi",5.0,Great Budget Monitor!,"Reviewed in the United States üá∫üá∏ on September 9, 2020",,True,"This review is for the SB220Q series (1920x1080) 75Hz monitor variant.  At a $90 price point as of July 2020, all of the praise this monitor has gotten and continues to get is pretty well deserved.  Right out of the box the factory calibration is pretty awful as with most TVs and monitors (I‚Äôll never understand why that is), but Acer‚Äôs built-in menu gives you a wide range of control to tweak the image quality to your liking.  Here are some of the most noticeable Pros & Cons after using this monitor daily for the past three weeks:PROS:- The colors can be very vibrant and the sharpness makes everything nice and crisp both up close and from a distance without going overboard.  Although the spec sheet does not specify the exact Adobe or sRGB color gamut range, it does have a stated 72% NTSC coverage (keep in mind that the NTSC color gamut has the highest level of color reproduction), which would imply that it should have close to 100% sRGB coverage.  This is pretty standard for most sub $200 monitors (note: the unit that TechSpot tested came in at around 93% of sRGB coverage mostly losing detail in the green range so your unit‚Äôs reproduction may vary).  The 6-bits + FRC (equal to 8-bits) color depth is also an industry standard for entry level monitors and is completely fine for casual use.- This montior‚Äôs ‚Äú100,000,000:1‚Äù Dynamic Contrast Ratio (DCR) (non-standardized measure of contrast for videos) definitely seems to outperform my other slightly more expensive budget IPS monitors (the HP VH240a and ViewSonic VS2412-H)  that only have 20,000,000:1 and 50,000,000:1 contrast ratios respectively.  However, note that it still has an industry standard 1000:1 Static Contrast Ratio (measure for non-moving images) which isn‚Äôt great but is perfectly acceptable for casual viewing since only the highest tiered ($400+) IPS panels exceed that point with 1,500:1 being the maximum native contrast typically achievable with an IPS.~ A quick side note about that ‚Äú100,000,000:1‚Äù DCR number:  there is no industry standard methodology for this particular measurement so the number itself is mostly useless marketing fluff.  But as I noted, compared to the two other monitors with the same industry standard SCR, this monitor did seem to outperform them both in that area.- Its 102 PPI pixel density actually makes a subtle difference in image quality when viewing up close compared to my 24 inch 1080p monitors that have a 92 PPI.  Text seems to be a bit smoother in comparison.  This is purely an advantage of having the smaller 21.5 inch screen.- The Color Adjustment Menu allows you to adjust both the RGB and CMY gains, bias, hues, and saturation levels to get a better color balance.- The Picture Menu lets you adjust the screen‚Äôs brightness, contrast, gamma, and blackness (‚Äúblack boost‚Äù) levels while also providing a ‚Äòblue light‚Äô, ‚Äòadaptive constrast‚Äô (ACM), and a ‚ÄòSuper Sharpness‚Äô on/off switch.- The Game Menu has FreeSync (for AMD GPUs) and Overdrive optionsCONS:- The bezels are a bit thicker than I woud‚Äôve liked (they‚Äôre about 1 cm on the top, left, and right sides) making the frameless design nothing more than a gimmick.- The top-down viewing angle is noticeably darker compared to looking at the screen head on.- Despite having a good DCR of 100M:1, the blacks are still a bit too bright for watching anything with heavy dark scenes since the display itself does not have any HDR capabilities with high contrast control zones aka local dimming (to be fair, this is completely expected at this $90 price point and is only being mentioned as reference for those that may be thinking of using this monitor to watch TV/movies).- The Picture Menu‚Äôs ‚ÄòSuper Sharpness‚Äô option is just an on/off switch; it does not give you a more granular adjustment control over the amount of sharpness to apply.- Even with all of the image quality adjustment options available in the settings, the whites remain on the slightly warmer side of the color temperature chart.  It‚Äôs not that noticeable when viewing on this monitor alone, but the difference can be seen if you have another slightly cooler display adjacent to it.  This is most likely just an issue with my particular unit since other reviews have noted their unit had a more neutral or ‚Äúnear perfect‚Äù white temp.- It only has a paltry 15¬∞ degree back tilt compared to most other budget monitors being able to tilt closer to 30¬∞ degrees (this is super nitpicky as compromises are to be expected at a sub $100 price point).- The Power button is completely indistinguishable from the rest of the menu buttons (both in shape and spacing).Overall, if you‚Äôre looking for a nice quality budget monitor to look at spreadsheets, word documents, and do some internet browsing or even some light casual gaming, then this is a great choice.  If you are a competitive gamer, photographer, professional editor, or a content creator then you‚Äôll obviously need to invest in a higher spec monitor.",102 people found this helpful
"Acer 21.5 Inch Full HD (1920 x 1080) IPS Ultra-Thin Zero Frame Computer Monitor (HDMI & VGA Port), SB220Q bi",5.0,Absolutely Amazing Value - Some other features not even listed!,"Reviewed in the United States üá∫üá∏ on November 12, 2018",,True,"This monitor is definitely a good value. Does it have superb color and contrast? No. Does it boast the best refresh rate on the market? No. But if you're tight on money, this thing looks and preforms great for the money. It has a Matte screen which does a great job at eliminating glare. The chassis it's enclosed within is absolutely stunning. It features a VGA and and HDMI port. The screen automatically detects signals and turns on when a source is turned on. When the selected source turns off it quickly scans and switches to any other sources. If no connections are available it goes into standby automatically. The power chord is a good 6 or more feet and easy to wrap with half of it being very thin wire. The ON LED is not distracting or too bright. When it's off it looks like a borderless monitor. And unlike what other people say it does have tilt, just not forward or left to right. It stands up straight or leans back. Unfortunately it doesn't have VESA mount holes, but under 100 you can't be that serious about your monitor setup. Small text has some problems fully rendering when using VGA so I recommend using HDMI. If you use the Windows 10 settings to configure how text is displayed though it fixes this, but not all will know how to do that. It doesn't have speaker, and I am thankful that most monitors don't. This monitor has A LOT of settings for gaming, night use, color adjustments, and general settings and all can be saved into 3 different gaming profiles. You can even change what settings appear in the quick menu. When u press any of the menu buttons, the menu pops up and clearly illustrates all the buttons. This monitors menus are super easy to understand and navigate and that's a rarity in its own. Also worth noting; it can display crosshairs and display the monitors current refresh rate. It also packs FreeSync for AMD graphics card users. If you only have DVI, you can get DVI to HDMI chords as long as your computer's video out supports it. The base and monitor couple together with one screw that features a hand flap so you don't need a screw diver if you don't want to use one. It is decently sturdy and the screen doesn't distort even when pressed on with strong pressure. The base is quite large, but wont be a problem for most. I haven't noticed any screen delay compared to my 300 dollar 1ms response time monitor (and I'm pretty picky). It's contrast is a little flat in some scenarios but appears much more dynamic in games, especially with some tweaking. With that said, I like that it looks flat when working on documents because it makes it much easier to focus.All in all, this monitor is filled with a good balance of features and looks like a very solid 1080p 75Hz IPS screen for any monitor under $160, let alone the $80 I paid. If you don't absolutely need a better refresh rate and aren't planning on spending more than 200 dollars then I would say just buy this monitor. It's durable, feature packed, and looks fantastic in all use-case scenarios. I'd give it 1000 stars if I could.","1,547 people found this helpful"
"Acer 21.5 Inch Full HD (1920 x 1080) IPS Ultra-Thin Zero Frame Computer Monitor (HDMI & VGA Port), SB220Q bi",5.0,No complaints so far,"Reviewed in the United States üá∫üá∏ on April 1, 2023",,True,Shopping was delayed by one day. Package arrived in great condition and with plenty of extra cords. The base was slightly hard to get on but use a little muscle and ur good. I got this as a second smaller screen for my gaming set up and it‚Äôs very helpful for filming and gaming and all the other multitasking things at the same time lol the base seems sturdy too and has a slightly larger footprint which is great since I‚Äôm clumsy and shake the table often. As a simple and affordable monitor I recommend it. Makes my switch look great.,3 people found this helpful
"Acer 21.5 Inch Full HD (1920 x 1080) IPS Ultra-Thin Zero Frame Computer Monitor (HDMI & VGA Port), SB220Q bi",4.0,"Affordable, decent quality, occasional pixilation, very green (RGB)","Reviewed in the United States üá∫üá∏ on March 28, 2023",,True,"Bought this after my Asus monitor started to get bad. At first, I had a problem where the image was very yellow, which I noticed when the white Acer logo appeared green. I was not able to fix it on my computer, I had to mess with the monitor's RGB Gains, which was aggravating my hand since the controls were on the underside of the monitor. After a couple of days of trouble shooting, I got the whites to an acceptable tone. Occasionally, in areas covered by a flat bright color, such as an image of the sky, I could see the pixels, but it can be overlooked, especially if you are playing a game or watching an action movie.",
"Acer 21.5 Inch Full HD (1920 x 1080) IPS Ultra-Thin Zero Frame Computer Monitor (HDMI & VGA Port), SB220Q bi",4.0,Don't forget to buy an HDMI,"Reviewed in the United States üá∫üá∏ on February 8, 2023",,True,"This is my second of these monitors that I have purchased, so even though I have not used this particular one yet, I will review my previous one.  I am bookkeeper, not a gamer.  This screen has served me so well as a second screen for my iMac, that I am purchasing another one so I can have 3 screens.  Sidenote, I have even packed this screen up and taken it on the road, the screen got scratched (of course) but otherwise, I had no issues dragging it around with me in a laundry basket in my rough riding pickup.Let's get to where this product lost a star.... it doesn't come with an hdmi cable.  It has the old pin style connector in the package.  If it was the only screen I was connecting, this would be fine, but if you're buying this as a second or third screen, order an hdmi cable (or whatever you prefer).  I feel like hdmi mostly replaced the old pin style a long time ago, and it would not have cost acer much to put both cables in the box, hence... 1 star lost.  Overall, a plenty good screen.",12 people found this helpful

I'm pleased with the size, brightness, and picture quality -- all a huge improvement over what I had been using, and at a great price. HOWEVER. These monitors are VERY thin and light, with a lightweight base. The result is that they move VERY easily. If I bump my desk, the monitors shift. If I have to reach behind them (such as to feed a cord behind the desk), I'm afraid I'm going to bump them and tip them over. If I'd shopped for these in store instead of online, I would have purchased something that's more stable/more hefty. Overall, though, I'm happy with them.",2 people found this helpful

I was on a budget and decided to get this monitor as an external display for my laptop, I use it for gaming and everyday use.Pros:- Good size (I wasn't looking for a big monitor)- Fairly thin bezels. They are still a bit thick but aren't as bad compared to other monitors.- Decent color accuracy- 75Hz is fairly smooth. There is some ghosting when you're gaming, but if you don't pay too much attention, you won't notice.- Good for gaming.Cons:- Took me a while to calibrate. This monitor does not come out color accurate out of the box. The whites aren't always white and blacks aren't always black.- Screen bleeding. Being an IPS display, it's kind of bound to happen. If you lower the brightness, it won't be so bad (depends on where and how bad your screen bleed is)- No HDMI cord- No built-in speakers",8 people found this helpful

"Acer 21.5 Inch Full HD (1920 x 1080) IPS Ultra-Thin Zero Frame Computer Monitor (HDMI & VGA Port), SB220Q bi",5.0,"Great quality, fantastic price!","Reviewed in the United States on February 17, 2019",,True,"I purchased this monitor for my wife to use with her Alienware R17X4 laptop. She had broken a key on her keyboard but also wanted a little larger screen. So, I purchased a wireless keyboard and this monitor. She now uses the powerful Alienware laptop as a desktop with a larger display and a wireless, movable keyboard. She is a very happy camper.Others have commented on the great graphics, thin design, and good quality build for a great price, so I won't repeat those details here. I will however point out a few tips:1. At first, it seems the stand will not tilt. But it does! Grasp the stand firmly and then tilt the monitor back to the desired position. Note it does not tilt forward or side to side, but does tilt back (facing more upwards towards your eyes) which really helps in most settings.2. If you don't get a signal, make sure you plugs the HDMI cable into the ""HDMI out"" port on your PC, not the ""HDMI in"" port. Duh. I had mine plugged into the wrong port until I found my reading glasses and saw the problem.3. We changed three settings which you may want to also do if you have a laptop. First, we changed the display settings to choose between ""Second screen only"", ""Duplicate"",  or ""Extend"". We chose ""Extend"" so she can have two documents open at once on the two monitors, her laptop screen and the new monitor. You just drag one document off the edge of the monitor to move it to the other screen.4. Next, we found that closing the laptop, when she only needed one screen, put it into hibernation and shut everything down. We went into Control Panel and changed Power Settings under ""What happens when you close the lid"". We changed it from ""Hibernate"" to ""Do nothing"". Now the laptop keeps running even when the laptop is closed.5. Third, most Windows laptops are configured so you have to drag things off the right edge of your new remote monitor to get them onto the laptop screen. However we wanted her laptop setting to the left of her new monitor, so it was confusing to have to drag something off the right-hand edge of the monitor to get it onto the left-hand screen on the laptop. We went back into display settings, where you can drag the two monitors in the settings to reverse them. Now, she can drag items from the left-hand screen to the right-hand screen by dragging them in that direction, and vice versa. Much more intuitive to use that way.With those changes to the settings, she can open the laptop and use it as two monitors, dragging and dropping documents and apps from one screen to another. When she closes the laptop lid, it reverts to a single monitor (the new Acer) but does not go to sleep. This is perfect for what she needs. She can still power off the monitor when not needed for an extended period. Also, the laptop speakers still work when she turns on the sound even when the laptop is closed.I highly recommend this monitor for anyone wanting a very good quality, cost-effective solution.",7 people found this helpful

I built a zombie containment unit for Halloween a few years ago in which it used a monitor to give the illusion a zombie was trapped inside the unit.  I used a very cheap monitor in the past and found that it looked okay when looking straight on at it, but any angle from the sides or from the bottom would wash out the image and the illusion was broken.  Given that the ""window"" was about 5 and a half feet from the ground, anyone shorter couldn't view the video.So, I found that I needed a type of monitor that had wide viewing angles so you can see it from off angles instead of just straight on.  This monitor has an IPS board that allowed for these sharper viewing angles.Here are some things that I looked for when researching a monitor to buy:* Largest monitor I could buy for under $100 USD* Lightweight as it would be hung on the inside of the ""unit""* Bright/vivid video* Sharp viewing angles without loss of image quality* at least 22"" diagonal width.  The previous monitor was only 15"" so I wanted to get a larger size for more realistic size ""zombiie"" within.This monitor checked off all the boxes.  I also had a $15 Amazon gift card which softened the hit to the wallet.Once received, I hooked up the power cord and an HDMI cable that went to a small digital video player that had a memory card which played the trapped zombie clip.  I didn't attach the base as doing so would not allow me to mount the monitor inside the cabinet.  This isn't a Halloween prop build video so any details of the unit is limited to the monitor itself.I used a felt material inside the cabinet along the edges where the front of the monitor would be in contact with to protect the screen as this is a bezel-less screen on the top and sides.  I didn't want any scratches!  No bezels was the only real drawback to the monitor.  Funny to think that as any other use would welcome no bezels.Anyway, the clip I uploaded is the monitor integrated within the cabinet.  I'm really happy with how it turned out and having this monitor has really took this prop a notch up.Overall, I recommend this monitor if you are looking for a monitor with sharp viewing angles.  Colors are good, no dead pixels on my screen and the price was right for the size.  Other than how I use it, I can't say much more.",32 people found this helpful
"Acer 21.5 Inch Full HD (1920 x 1080) IPS Ultra-Thin Zero Frame Computer Monitor (HDMI & VGA Port), SB220Q bi",5.0,Good deal for a throwaway monitor,"Reviewed in the United States on February 9, 2021",,True,"I used to live in a cool, quiet house in a valley but had to move into a hot and noisy apartment in the city, with no A/C. The temps inside get up to 88 F on a hot day with a 90 F high! As room temp is considered to be 68-72 F, I was worried about my high end Lenovo ThinkVision monitor ($300) and HP color laser printer ($400) being fried or corroded in the heat and humidity of this wretched climate. So I placed both in my air-conditioned self storage unit while I look for better living conditions.To replace them, I decided to buy this $85 Acer monitor and an $85 HP inkjet printer (which costs less than a black toner cartridge for my color laser) and I could pretty much dump then when I move abroad to live (my main intentions). While the Acer is no match for the color saturation, overall screen quality, and bells and whistles of the Lenovo (which was pretty much hand-picked at Best Buy before I pulled the trigger on a good monitor), the Acer has surprised me for such a cheap monitor. It's sharp and color contrast is excellent. My main issue was the screen background being yellowish-green compared to my Lenovo or my Dell XPS, however it got whiter with time as the monitor burned in. In addition, I used the preset screen settings and found a couple that was able to whiten up the screen quite a bit, so that now, it's not bad at all.For $85, I expected soft, blurry text with dull colors in which case I'd return the monitor but I have no complaints now: sharp, excellent color saturation and contrast, and decently white background. Just be aware it has ZERO USB ports, no USB charging port, no HDMI or DisplayPorts, and no audio out port - nor height and tilt adjustments - like my Lenovo. In addition, Acer deleted the audio out port that the earlier models had. Well, I guess you get what you pay for. It's probably worth it to spend 3-4X the cost of the Acer to get a good monitor like the Lenovo, but for my purposes, the Acer suits me fine. I might have to find room in my self storage to keep the monitor as it's too good to throw away!",

"Acer 21.5 Inch Full HD (1920 x 1080) IPS Ultra-Thin Zero Frame Computer Monitor (HDMI & VGA Port), SB220Q bi",4.0,Tilt controversy solved,"Reviewed in the United States on June 21, 2019",,True,"Good monitor for the price.  Nice picture, no dead pixels.  Menu system allows for lots of adjustments, but is hard to navigate thanks to a roughly 5 second timeout if no buttons are pressed.  Be sure to download the .PDF manual, it has lots more information than the printed one that comes with the monitor.Both manuals say that monitor will tilt, but at first it would not budge with any reasonable degree of force.  My husband, whose mechanical skill is high, looked over what appeared to be the hinge joint at the top of the base pedestal.  It's made of steel, and it looked like there was a nut that controlled the friction of the hinge.  However, the nut is inaccessible to a wrench while the hinge is installed in the pedestal.  Removing four screws from the pedestal allowed the hinge to come out.  Loosening the nut did not free up the hinge as expected.  The rivet on the other side of the hinge joint was still causing excessive binding.  Application of some silcone lube didn't help, nor did working the hinge back and forth using tools.  Eventually my husband resorted to drilling off the driven head of the rivet and punching it out.  Note there are several small washers on both the screw and rivet that need to be kept track of.  Rivet was not reusable.  It has a shoulder on it, which should have kept it from binding the hinge, but apparently the wider portion of the rivet was too short.  He replaced the rivet with a 6mm screw.  This involved both reaming the hole in the outer hinge bracket and grinding the screw head so it would fit inside the pedestal.  A nut was installed just a little more than finger tight on the new screw.  Some Loctite might be advisable for monitors that get frequent tilt adjustments.The original screw, stack of washers, and nut was reinstalled, and the nut adjusted to what seemed the correct degree of tightness.  The hinge was reinstalled in the pedestal.  When the base was attached to the monitor, it tilted easily and stayed where it was put.This job took a considerable amount of skill, and probably voids some warranty or other.  Not for the clumsy or faint of heart.  FWIW, many users will likely find that loosening the friction nut will free up the hinge enough to make it work properly, without dealing with the rivet.The hinge is well designed and plenty beefy, and the amount of leverage available to the user when it's joined to the base and monitor is considerable.  However, there's a high risk of breaking the plastic parts of the monitor case or pedestal if the user gets too frisky.  A little more attention to QC by Acer or its suppliers should have made this a non-problem.",One person found this helpful

Does it have superb color and contrast? No. Does it boast the best refresh rate on the market? No. But if you're tight on money, this thing looks and preforms great for the money. It has a Matte screen which does a great job at eliminating glare. The chassis it's enclosed within is absolutely stunning. It features a VGA and and HDMI port. The screen automatically detects signals and turns on when a source is turned on. When the selected source turns off it quickly scans and switches to any other sources. If no connections are available it goes into standby automatically. The power chord is a good 6 or more feet and easy to wrap with half of it being very thin wire. The ON LED is not distracting or too bright. When it's off it looks like a borderless monitor. And unlike what other people say it does have tilt, just not forward or left to right. It stands up straight or leans back. Unfortunately it doesn't have VESA mount holes, but under 100 you can't be that serious about your monitor setup. Small text has some problems fully rendering when using VGA so I recommend using HDMI. If you use the Windows 10 settings to configure how text is displayed though it fixes this, but not all will know how to do that. It doesn't have speaker, and I am thankful that most monitors don't. This monitor has A LOT of settings for gaming, night use, color adjustments, and general settings and all can be saved into 3 different gaming profiles. You can even change what settings appear in the quick menu. When u press any of the menu buttons, the menu pops up and clearly illustrates all the buttons. This monitors menus are super easy to understand and navigate and that's a rarity in its own. Also worth noting; it can display crosshairs and display the monitors current refresh rate. It also packs FreeSync for AMD graphics card users. If you only have DVI, you can get DVI to HDMI chords as long as your computer's video out supports it. The base and monitor couple together with one screw that features a hand flap so you don't need a screw diver if you don't want to use one. It is decently sturdy and the screen doesn't distort even when pressed on with strong pressure. The base is quite large, but wont be a problem for most. I haven't noticed any screen delay compared to my 300 dollar 1ms response time monitor (and I'm pretty picky). It's contrast is a little flat in some scenarios but appears much more dynamic in games, especially with some tweaking. With that said, I like that it looks flat when working on documents because it makes it much easier to focus.",

At first, the monitors seemed dim which was rather disappointing, but I tried out some of the display settings which has made the picture much more pleasing to look at.  There is a subtle glare when darker images are on the screen which is much more apparent than my other monitor, but not horrendous.  In short, there‚Äôs probably better monitors out there but for a cheap, 1080p monitor I feel it‚Äôs worth it.I will note that the monitors are supposed to be able to tilt.

They were around the $90-93 price range. I gotta say, for the price, I am very satisfied with how well it's done for me. My family also has no complaints using this monitor with their own PC's. The bottom base of the monitor is super easy to install. No built-in speakers, but if you use external speakers and a headset like me, you don't even need/want them. As I mentioned in the title, these are not VESA-mountable so if you're looking to mount these monitors, look elsewhere.Some of my main games are League, Apex, Monster Hunter: World, Final Fantasy XIV, Final Fantasy XV, Call of Duty: Black Ops 3, and Tekken 7. This is a decent range of graphics intensive and non-graphics intensive games. I had zero issues with response times and frame rates. They all run smoothly with my GTX 1060 (as long as you play on medium-ish settings). Sure the colors aren't mind-blowing but I don't care at all. I personally think it kicks ass for the price.When it comes to non-gaming stuff, like school or work, there's not really much to ask for other than a monitor that can turn on and work, and this monitor is definitely capable of doing everyday tasks. The 75hz is also very nice.I don't use these monitors anymore as I have upgraded my setup, but I should mention that during the last few months of using these monitors (I had a dual monitor setup), one of the screens randomly goes black every now and then, then turns back on. It can get pretty annoying and can even cost you during crucial moments in-game.Other than that, this monitor was part of my first gaming PC build and I am still very happy for how much it has done for me.

The viewing angles are actually so bad for left/right that there is only a very small position where I can leave my head so that there is no discolouration on the sides, worse than any TN panel I've ever seen. Also, it looks like there is a lot of excess light directly off center to your head's position, as if there is backlight bleed that shifts as you move your head left and right while staring at the screen.Since this was purchased to be my second monitor, it isn't that big of a problem to ME specifically... but it also means it's impossible to keep my head in the perfect position, due to it being off-center to me. I actually had to tilt the screen somewhat sideways (instead of being flush next to my main monitor) so that the sides would mostly look normal in terms of colour.Now I WILL admit that it is possible this is a defect with my actual screen, possibly some problem with backlight bleed or something, but since this is my only sample size, I must rate it accordingly. If Acer has a problem with my statements, they should step up their quality control game and not let a monitor like this pass inspection for sale.Now, the good! For a breakdown, I've rated this a 4/5 for gaming, 3/5 for picture quality, and 5/5 for brightness, here's my take on each:- The input lag is quite low; there is no system lag while working on it. Being above 60Hz also gives it a solid edge for gamers. Gamers generally care less about viewing angle issues like what I described, so as a gaming screen this should not be too bad. Unfortunately I still cannot ignore the viewing angle problem due to how bad it is, and I will never rate any screen below 120Hz as 5 stars for gaming, so it settles at 4.- Picture quality is actually quite good. The contrast is great and the colours very crisp - if the viewing angles and backlight shenanigans were a non-issue i would probably even rate this 5 stars (largely considering the price), but alas, 3 stars.- For brightness, it's certainly bright enough for my needs, though I've not used it in direct sunlight. The anti-glare works well and it keeps its picture quality and visibility perfectly fine even with a flashlight shone at it. I cannot ask for more, so full marks here.All in all, for $90 I cannot truly complain. It does its job of being a screen for discord, watching videos/anime, and handling my stream alerts/notifications. It's light and easy to set up, the on/standby light is not bright yet still well visible, so not distracting in a dark room. Unfortunately viewing angle issue and discolouration it produces ALONE is enough for me to say consider other options, but the rest of the screen pulls it up a bit.If this is going to be your main monitor, and you are not someone who does little but game on your computer? Stay far away. If you need a cheap, decent screen for gaming or this is going to be a low-importance second monitor? I'd say it's up for consideration, if only because it's 75Hz at this price point.",14 people found this helpful
"Acer 21.5 Inch Full HD (1920 x 1080) IPS Ultra-Thin Zero Frame Computer Monitor (HDMI & VGA Port), SB220Q bi",5.0,Wish I had gotten this sooner!,"Reviewed in the United States on July 13, 2020",,True,"My laptop screen finally burned out and I needed a quick but still decent solution since a whole new computer is out of budget right now. Boy, did I luck out finding this! At 22"" it's about a 5"" upgrade from the original screen in roughly the same footprint on my desk. And wow is it SHARP... and BRIGHT! I can now sit back further from my desk without straining my eyes while editing photos, reading, and watching videos. Since I'm not a hardcore gamer I can't speak to its performance in that regard, except to say that emulated DOOM ran perfectly smooth and looked great on it :-DMy only real gripe is that the buttons for power, display settings, etc are located under the bottom edge of the screen, which is really inconvenient, and there's no labeling or anything on the front edge to correspond to which button is which, so until you learn the layout by muscle memory, you might have to do like i did and keep the diagram from the manual as a cheat sheet. Once you get into the menus, however, there are plenty of options to tweak to your heart's content. I really like that there's a ""blue light"" setting for working at night or when you just want to give your eyes a break (obviously, you wouldn't want this on if you're editing photos, but for reading it's fantastic). There's also a display widget for certain models that you can download from the Acer website that gives you point-and-click desktop access to some of these adjustments without having to use the monitor buttons. A nice touch, but it would be nice if ALL the features could be accessed through the widget as well.Setup is plug-and-play; I literally had this out of the box and ready to go within minutes (you will need to supply your own HDMI cable if you don't have one; only a VGA cable is included). Apparently some models have built-in audio; I can tell you that the SB220Q that I have does NOT have audio out, so you will need external speakers to run the sound from your system out to if that's an issue.VERY happy with this value monitor!",4 people found this helpful

I changed no settings other than making text bigger after switching from my tv to this so why are things so grainy and blurry with this ""number 1 ranked"" monitor?  I only bought this monitor to help my eyes.. I have bad eyesight and as I age it's getting worse. Going from a 43 inch tv to a 21inch monitor is difficult but It's helped me enjoy streaming more since I still use my tv for streaming. It's helped me play LoL better because now I don't have to look two feet to the side anymore lol. I am disappointed with how hard it is to clean the screen. My tv screen is also hard but it never absorbed water(maybe my tv has a coating or something). I wish I would have known this screen absorbs things before I tried to clean it.. Made a permanent smudge(maybe its not permanent and I just don't know what cleaner I'm supposed to use on screens). I had old monitors that were SO easy to clean the screens(LCD flat panels..). Since I've been using this monitor and keeping my tablets blue light filter on I have not had a single eye strain related eye twitch. I just wish it were capable of being cleaned and that things weren't so GRAINY.  The only reason why I'm not sending it back is because it's clearly helping my eyes not get as strained..... I would have given it less stars if I didn't care about my eyesight as much. I can confirm it has tilt but I couldn't figure out how to get the tilt to STAY tilted without re screwing those two screws back in(which made it not tilt anymore lol..) So I wedged a Popsicle stick in it to keep it SECURELY tilted. Luckily I can't see the eyesore when using the monitor even with it tilted back. I'm not sure why it takes 6 seconds for this monitor to turn on. My entire pc only takes 13 and its 8 years old(with a newer nvidia gpu that makes me want to go back to amd sometimes). I wish the power light didn't blink when in standby mode. I'd love to not turn this monitor off when I'm not using it because it goes to standby mode very quickly after my pc is off and only uses 0.05 watts more than being off and plugged into outlet but that blinking power light is too annoying.",One person found this helpful

I have a dead pixel and if I hadn't found it, I probably would have lived comfortably until I step up my monitor experience in the future but now that I am fully aware of the single pixel that glows opposite of my desktop wallpaper, video streaming and photo editing. It scratches a part of me that triggers some discomfort.

FIRST pros!1. The ease of use was fine.  After hooking it up, I simply hit the on button, the first switch from your right just to the right of and behind the prominent LED.  The led is subtle and blue when on.  I didn't need to set anything else.2. It DOES tilt, but it isn't that obvious.  Once assembled, you have to push the top of the monitor to tilt it.  It should be a little easier, but it is fine.3. The picture is fine.4. If you have a VGA monitor, it comes with a cable for it.  I got a long hdmi cable to hook it up.5. The price seems about PERFECT!  It seems the smaller ones are not much less, if they are at all, and ones that are slightly larger cost a LOT more, so this seems to be the current sweet spot.  And in this range, this particular model is probably about in the center of the price range.The ONE con I had was that I spend so much time looking for a monitor with a good track record, that I slipped up on getting my one nice to have I hoped for, AUDIO.  This has no audio, apparently.  Otherwise, it is FINE for the moment.  I spent a while, and even went to anther company, to make sue the reliability and features were there.  Here's hoping I feel the same way 2 years and more from now.  The last monitor I got, for another system about 4 years ago, and STILL working well, is a model that isn't made any more, and the related monitors have a lower general rating than I would like, so I picked THIS one.BTW I didn't rate gaming, as I don't play games.

There is only a vga cable and power cord in the box.I bought this to use with my older mac mini (mid 2011) using a thunderbolt to vga adaptor that I already had. However I tested it right out of the box as a second display with my Acer windows laptop. My review is therefore for these two systems as shown:1) With Windows (Acer) laptop: I connected the vga cable to my acer laptop and it instantly recognized and duplicated the screen without a hitch. There is a bit of tilt to the monitor on the mount which allows it to be adjusted backward or forward (like an up or down neck motion). The colors of my desktop wallpaper appear true to the original and crisp, however words were blurry until I updated the drivers in Windows Device Manager and tweaked the resolution to be the same on both regular setting and 'active signal resolution.' ONE WORRISOME ISSUE came up: There is a horizontal flickering/flashing white line near the top of the monitor running two-thirds across the width. It did not affect the display because it was outside where the display frame would be but it made me think the monitor was internally damaged. UNTIL I connected to my Mac Mini...2) With Mac Mini mid-2011:  Immediately after using the monitor for about two hours as a second Windows display to my Acer laptop, I disconnected from that system and connected the monitor to my Mac Mini 2011 model. Without any need for additional tweaking the display was immediately recognized, resolution and scaling were good, and my wallpaper slideshow is breathtaking. The colors are much more beautiful than the Windows system on the laptop, but I suspect this has more to do with the actual graphics card of the much older Mac Mini. Most notably however, is that the flickering and flashing white horizontal line is not showing on the Mac display. I have no idea what to make of this. Luckily I bought this monitor to use with the Mac Mini so for now I am very happy of the quality and rendering of this display for the price.",3 people found this helpful

However, I fixed the problem, and I now am keeping the screen.  I think it's a good product for the money.I am using this monitor with a docking station for my laptop.  I initially used an HDMI-to-VGA converter to then connect a VGA cable to the monitor.  The VGA cable was the one shipped with this monitor.  That setup was very problematic.  The display quality was okay but not great, but the real problem was that the screen intermittently turned off and on, multiple times per hour.  It was unworkable.Today, I went to Walgreens and bought a simple, 6-ft HDMI cable (HDMI plug on both sides, it is not a converter).  I plugged the HDMI cable directly between my docking station and this Acer monitor.  The image quality is now very stable and greatly improved.  I also have not experienced the intermittent off-on issue, even though I have been watching movies with heavy graphics (e.g., I tested it with a trailer for World of Warcraft).So there you have it.

We‚Äôve played with the colors and brightness, but that just made the colors weird or the image too dark.- The input naming is not consistent nor intuitive.  It took a few days to decipher what the weird labels meant.  It would have been better to just keep the names HDMI 1, HDMI 2, and HDMI 3.  I would like to have more control on their naming and which ones to display as options.- The audio often does not work when switching to an HDMI-connected device.

Sometimes it takes a few tries to get it working.- The TV sometimes becomes non responsive, and the power light flashes several times.  We can get it working again after pushing the power button a few times, but it takes a minute.  This usually occurs while trying to get the audio working.- The AirPlay does not work, which is the main reason I went with Vizio and this TV.  It took a few tries to sync my iPhone to the TV, but then it only worked for a few seconds before the TV froze.  This has happens every time I try using AirPlay.This is my first experience with Vizio.  I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs the brand or this specific cheap TV, but I plan to spend a little more to buy a better brand next time.  I would return it and get a refund if it wasn‚Äôt past the free returns period.  The only good thing about this TV is that it keeps you from turning into a couch potato because it takes a lot of manual fiddling to keep it working.",One person found this helpful

I spent forever looking for the right monitor and let me tell you I am so glad I made this purchase and saved some money. Lets go with some pros and consPROS:- cheap! Super great price!- Slim! It is sleek and fit perfectly on my small desk- HD! Covers the whole monitor with no negative space! (my old monitor did not do that)CONS:- Some color rendering! You will probably see when you first open google chrome on your computer that some of the same colored items and displays have lines through them. I am no expert but I assume this is because of the low pixels to render. However, when you open up a game or a video, that goes away, so I wouldn't worry too much about it.- Only 3 outputs! There is a VGA output that is slightly outdated and is not used for modern models of PCs. There is also an HDMI cable which is what I'm using to hook it up to my computer. Then there is the plug. The lack of outputs may limit some possibilities but if you're just looking for a monitor that can display your computer than you should be fine.OVERALL:Really good monitor and especially for the price. If you are just getting into PC gaming like me, and especially if you have a budget, then this is the best option.",3 people found this helpful

I dropped a LG monitor 22"" a few feet and because it has a bit stronger/thicker bezel, it survived.  There is no way this would survive a small fall. This isn't necessarily a bad thing because ppl don't usually drop their monitors, but it's something to consider.  Also, because the bezel is so thin, there is no room for VESA.. and this is where I would take a hard pass for this monitor.  VESA is required for myself. Personally, I don't think anyone who wants any type of customization (with their setup) to purchase a monitor w/o VESA mounting.Overall I would recommend this monitor if it's at $90 and you if you do not need VESA mounting.  Also it's important to note that it does not have audio pass-through, which is helpful if you wanna extract the audio from the HDMI and have no other ways of doing it. I use the audio pass-through on my other monitors to connect to my speakers.  This is helpful for things like use with the Nintendo Switch which doesn't have an audio port on the dock.",3 people found this helpful

I haven't had it long enough to know if there will be screen burn-in but the price is really good so if that happens some day it won't be a big hassle to replace it.I can't speak for gaming as the refresh rate may not be appropriate for that, although I've enjoyed games at this refresh rate so it might be great -- Find out elsewhere as I have no idea.  Personally for gaming I'd use a bigger monitor but this is the right size for my needs.I'm using the VGA input because that's all my surveillance system has for output.  I was worried the VGA input might not produce a good picture but was pleasantly surprised... it's really excellent.  My photo doesn't do it justice.  I've also attached short video where you can see squirrels running along my fence.I like that this monitor is light weight and very thin.  And yes it DOES tilt on the stand, although it doesn't move up or down.  Personally I will mount it to a wall.  (Actually ""in"" the wall by cutting into the drywall, then adding a picture frame so it looks like part of the home.)  The thin profile, light weight, and thin bezel will help the installation and produce a good-looking result.I also like that the power supply has a small brick, from which a thin low-voltage cord connects to the monitor.Good picture, great price, and a nice physical profile.

Hooked it up to my current PC and it works like a charm. The colors are vibrant and there's no hiccups or delays that I've seen. This monitor does NOT come with an HDMI cable, as I had anticipated, but does come with a VGA connector only. Be sure to keep that in mind when ordering.The only real issue I have is with the brightness. The monitor doesn't dim to my liking (which is, admittedly, just personal taste), but the max brightness works wonderfully if you like your monitors beaming. It does not have any mounting capabilities that I can see, as it doesn't have the VESA hole patterns on the back, or any hole patterns for that matter.Overall, the monitor is nice to use. It's sleek, thin, and light. It works exactly as you'd expect a monitor to, and it works well in that aspect.

I know this is common in the LCD world, and might be due to ordering from separate batches, but I just wanted to mention it.  I adjusted the color balance on the warmer LCD (I prefer cooler colors), and got it the colors pretty close, but I can still see a small difference in color between the two if I have a program open that spans both monitors.2) The height of the bases is slightly different between the two.  I have both monitors side-by-side, and are at the same angle, but one of the monitor bases is just a few millimeters taller than the other.  Addressed this by sticking a few thin pieces of cardboard underneath the stand of the shorter monitor.Moral of the story: if you want more than one monitor, I suggest buying them at the same time. You might have a better chance of getting similar-looking monitors.  If you buy them from separate batches, you may end up with monitors with slight differences.",

The tilt feature works well, and I don't have to turn the monitor off every time I leave my desk. It just starts up again when I ""un-sleep"" my laptop.For the money, it so far it seems like a great buy. Will update this review if that changes.",2 people found this helpful

It's more or less imperceptible unless you're working alongside another monitor that has high image resolution (i.e. my Macbook). I work with scans of 16th century documents, and the monitor display is good enough to work with. I'm not sure what a gamer would say about the resolution. I, too, thought the monitor did not tilt, but it does! Grab the column at the base and slightly push the monitor screen back by pushing at the top of the monitor. DON'T PUSH TOO HARD!

I have been using this monitor for around a couple months I would have to say. I have been loving this monitor. Great everything to be honest. Now, sadly if I wanted a second one I might have to upgrade the desk. I personally use mine for console gaming though, so I am not sure how it would operate with a PC.No controller of any sort included, however the monitor does have buttons on the bottom right. The very first one on the right is the power button (when I first got it, this was hard for me to figure out.) and the other buttons switch around a few things. Now for me it automatically detects my HDMI which is great and it also can have VGA cords connected (in fact it comes with a VGA cord).My only dissapointment is that it has no speakers (no audio) so you have to use a headset connected to either your console or PC whichever one you are using it for. If your using a Xbox One be careful, because that console is known for having headset audio issues. Works great with my PS4 though and it did with my Xbox One X as well.Disclaimer: My phone isn't the best with picture quality, so don't judge the monitors quality off of my picture haha.",
"Acer 21.5 Inch Full HD (1920 x 1080) IPS Ultra-Thin Zero Frame Computer Monitor (HDMI & VGA Port), SB220Q bi",4.0,Important which connection you use,"Reviewed in the United States üá∫üá∏ on November 27, 2018",,True,"I purchased this monitor to replace a several years old, but nice Dell model.  The build on this one feels light and cheap, but then it was 1/4th the cost of the previous monitor, and a monitor does not really have to put up with a lot of stress.  I use it for work (browsing, reading, some graphics) and a little personal (video), but not gaming or anything intensive so cannot speak to that.  What I did learn is that the input for video matters, a lot.  Initially I connected the monitor using my current VGA cable (one reason I chose this particular monitor).  The picture was fine, but I discovered that it did a poor job with any photo/video with dark tones.  In a darker or shadowy picture, all detail was lost (the image looks almost black in some cases).  This could not be remedied by adjusting contrast, etc.  It was bad enough that I decided to shop around until I found an alternative monitor, at about double the cost.  Just before initiating the return, on a whim, I changed the input to HDMI.  I figured this was more about HD video quality, etc.  But as soon as I made the switch, everything got better.  Suddenly photos looked perfect, problem solved.  This monitor does not come with an HDMI cable, so if you don't have one, I recommend purchasing one in addition.  The only other thing that is worth knowing is that, as mentioned in the description, this monitor cannot be tilted.  Because the base is round, propping it up is unstable.  For me, its fine, I have it tilted up, and it sits on the desk.  It would wobble at a bump, but its not really ever getting bumped.",51 people found this helpful

I have bought two so far and have not had any complaints on picture quality. I do have a couple of little issues that are just a personal preference more than anything:1) As you might have read already, there is NO Vesa mounting points on this monitor. Now this is fine for the two monitors i bought since the desks i bought them for do not have arms, but I like these monitors so much (especially the price) I wanted to buy some for the office, the only thing is that all of the work stations have computer arms.2) I do wish that this display was a little bit brighter. For the most part it is fine, definitely brighter than other monitors at this price point, but just as a personal preference i wish it could go a little brighter.All in all i love the two monitors that i have bought, and other than the two nit picky things i said above i dont have much else to complain about.

If you put them side by side, you will notice it, but it hasn't bothered me at all. Again, not a problem for my use, and I did not deduct any stars.Having said all that? I love these things. The monitors have performed flawlessly since I installed them (I use two) and they match color and brightness perfectly right out of the box. Like I said above, they're sharp, crisp, and bright.

The first one works completely fine. Switched over to the second one to test it. After 25 minutes of use, a line of dead pixels appeared across the middle of the screen and the bottom half started stuttering. After rebooting, the bottom half still stutters and a line of dead pixels still remains that runs across the middle of the screen. I guess I just got unlucky with getting a faulty monitor, but it is still a pretty big inconvenience having to deal with getting it replaced (hopefully).However, a functional one works great and the picture quality is pretty decent (nothing spectacular). I don't think the iPS makes that much of a difference because it's only 21.5"" so you'd be sitting pretty close, but it's still nice to have. Coming from a 13"" Macbook Pro, the screen size feels much larger without being overwhelming. If you're looking to have a dual monitor setup, at $89.99 each, it is great bang for your buck. If you want a dual set-up with a VESA stand, you'd have to buy two separate Acer VESA adapters, which would cost you $50-60 for two adapters alone.

I will shop around. Price hike is too greedy for this. Another reason why I am reluctant to review on Amazon now - unavailability, as well as price hikes just because. I'll just keep the 1 I have and move on. My original price was 89.99. This new price is just one reason people ""hate"" Capitalism. ***",One person found this helpful
"Acer 21.5 Inch Full HD (1920 x 1080) IPS Ultra-Thin Zero Frame Computer Monitor (HDMI & VGA Port), SB220Q bi",5.0,"Bright, user friendly, and affordable","Reviewed in the United States on March 15, 2020",,True,"When this monitor first arrived, the packaging was pristine and the monitor fit snugly in the packaging. The setup was extremely easy. The base and the neck of the base come detached from the screen, and they just slide together very easy with no tools required. When you turn it on, it autoscans to find what inputs you have plugged in. This feature can be turned off in the menu. The menu is simple to learn and easy to navigate. You can set the brightness, contrast, etc. manually, but there are also a number of preset profiles you can choose from. The screen can be made to be very bright if you like it that way, but if you're more comfortable with a more dim setting, it's easy to adjust. The color is very good too. The picture of the screen doesn't quite do the real-life experience justice, but the colors are captured very well. I have absolutely no complaints about this screen and will be buying 2 more next month. At $90, which is the price I bought this at, I really have no reason not to buy more. None of my friends believe me when I tell them the price of this screen, particularly after they've seen me gaming on it.",2 people found this helpful
"Acer 21.5 Inch Full HD (1920 x 1080) IPS Ultra-Thin Zero Frame Computer Monitor (HDMI & VGA Port), SB220Q bi",4.0,"Decent monitor for the price, but got one with a line of dead pixels","Reviewed in the United States on June 9, 2019",,True,"Picture quality isn't the greatest, it's an IPS panel, which is nice, but colors look pretty dull. For gaming, motion appeared surprisingly smooth. IPS panels usually have pretty high response times, which leads to ghosting and just motion in general in games doesn't look great, but didn't notice any ghosting or anything like that on this. Also surprised me the options in the menu. Menu is really easy to use and has a blue filter option, gaming options to optimize picture, freesync, has an overdrive option, and the crosshair aim thing.For a really cheap gaming monitor this would work pretty well, but I warn the picture is pretty lacking. If you're just looking for a monitor for web browsing and what not, I'd probably look for something with a little better picture quality.All in all though, probably one of the cheapest monitors I've ever seen and really doesn't disappoint. Main problem I had, and the reason I'm giving it 4 stars, is it has a like 2 inch line of dead pixels. Not sure if they would return it for that, and not sure if I want to deal with the hassle.Oh, and it's super thin, which is nice. It also has the thin bezels, but there's a like half inch black space between the actual displayed picture and the bezels.",

However, I cannot find a reason. My monitor arrived with zero dead pixels and a great picture given the price range.Since building my PC I have been on a 55"" 4K TV and later a 32"" 720p TV. The additional bandwidth this monitor is capable of makes a noticeable difference in gaming responsiveness.  While I still experience occasional tearing in games where my Video card is rendering frame-rates beyond the capabilities of the 75Hz it's still not enough to warrant going to 144Hz or 1440p. Having a Radeon 580 means most of my gaming still falls well within the specs of this monitor.Although monitor speakers almost always stink. It would have been nice to have a built in speaker and not give up additional desktop real-estate for speakers.

But I do programming, so in that respect it is decent enough.I currently use a mac with this, I use my Mac in clamshell mode since my mac screen broke and it is too expensive to get it replaced. The Mac is connected to the monitor via HDMI, and some customers might experience a downside upon first hooking up the monitor with the Mac: black borders on the screen. This appears to be problem with underscanning, and since Mac removed the underscan adjustment tool, the method I used to get the full screen can be found by searching: ""BLACK BORDERS ON YOUR EXTERNAL DISPLAY?

Just be careful cause it does not tilt very far. There is some kind of mechanism in the base that allows you to do this.

This monitor accomplishes all three of these very well, and my only gripe with it, is that it has no height adjustment. I had to use a box to put under the monitor so that I could see it without looking down. I knocked off a star for this, but if I could've only knocked a half-star I would've.

"Acer 21.5 Inch Full HD (1920 x 1080) IPS Ultra-Thin Zero Frame Computer Monitor (HDMI & VGA Port), SB220Q bi",4.0,Great but mounting issues,"Reviewed in the United States üá∫üá∏ on July 18, 2019",,True,"Originally purchased 2. The screen quality and form factor is superb. These things are paper thin, light and have very tiny bezels. One huge problem. They are not VESA compatibile (without an adapter). If you're looking to use these monitors on a separate mount, you might as well look elsewhere. Unfortunately, you are stuck using these with the stand they come with--which all things considered is a decent stand.You can make these monitors VESA mounting compatible, but it requires a proprietary adapter that runs you $20-$30!!! As much as I would like to go the route of adapters, the big issue for me lies in my monitor configuration. I use a monitor in normal, horizontal layout and I use another in vertical layout (useful for spreadsheets.) The ""clip-on"" mechanism these monitors use to connect to the stand is not ideal--nor would I feel it smart to use--for a vertical monitor configuration. All it takes is one small bump sideways and the monitor would become freed from the mount.  Unfortunately, I am not wealthy enough to take that risk. I need my monitor secured.In conclusion: great monitors, but if you're looking to mount them to anything other than the provided stand, consider other options",

Everything looks sharper and prettier.  Also, this monitor has an anti-glare screen, so your view won't be obstructed by background light.  The extra 15hz that this has over my old monitor hasn't stuck out to me yet, but it's nice to have.  It also supports Freesync.  I don't know who still uses VGA in 2019, but it comes with a VGA cord.I do find it strange that it only supports HDMI and VGA, when there are other formats out there, much better than the latter.  It'd be nice to have more than one HDMI port, in case I wanna hook up other devices, but it wasn't a deal-breaker for me.Overall, it's a great monitor for the asking price.  It looks good, displays well, is light and doesn't take up much space.  If you're okay with the limited amount of ports (which seems to be pretty standard for monitors around this price), then you'll be satisfied with this one.

I wiggled and jostled, pulled the back panel off and reseated the ribbon cable but nothing has changed. The color will occasionally change from red to blue or green, but a big red very near the center of the screen makes it a bit difficult to focus on anything.

No dead pixels and the picture is crisp, bright and colorful.  It also works with another, cheaper Windows 10 based mini stick PC.  Sometimes I temporarily switch to that to print something, as my mono laser printer is too old to work with my Mac.Keep in mind that the HDMI connection is straight out of the back, so you may want to consider an HDMI cable with one end having a 90 degree connector.  Make sure to look at the pics of the monitor so you get a cable with the 90 degree connector the right way rather than upside down.  This way the cable hangs down instead of sticking straight out.",

Monitor works as intended, but the hassle in getting a replacement with the endless ""customer service"" loop from Acer will prevent me from ordering another Acer product again.Price paid with tax : $95Arrived on time, but monitor was defective. No damage to box. Tested with two desktop computers (one Nvida GPU, one AMD GPU), a laptop, and an Xbox one. Tested with HDMI first, and VGA second, on all devices except VGA on Xbox. With all devices, same issue exists. Monitor cycles between pink, yellow, and clear hued screens, with a 1 second interval between hues. Tried with default settings first, and modified all settings to try to find a culprit. Nothing stopped the cycling from occurring. I attempted to reach out to Acer on two separate days, via web chat, and phone. After a wait of over 20 minutes for both methods, both times, the web chat said there ""There is no one to assist you at this time"", and the phone call just dropped. I have just initiated a return through Amazon, instead of trying to deal with Acer. I am a little surprised, as I own 4 other Acer monitors, and none of them have had an issue. I understand factory mistakes happen, or perhaps it was damaged in transit or storage, and that's why I tried to deal with Acer about it. But with over 80 minutes across two days being spent just trying to talk to someone form the company,to ultimately never talk to someone,  I will not be purchasing Acer products for awhile.",

I considered a BenQ which I had purchased before, as well as HP, Asus Dell and other Acers. This Acer was priced right and came with the connectors I needed for hook-up. The display is pleasing and far superior to the monitor it replaced. Hard to compare to the BenQ which also has a decent display. My issue with the BenQ that was being offered at the time was that it was refurbished and I preferred to buy brand new. The Acer was also slightly less expensive.

But I do not want to blame that on anyone because the actual size (21.5 inches I guess) was written with the product and it was my reponsibily to check that. One of the things that I liked about this screen is that it is thin which I usually have not seen with other screens. But one of the things that I didn't like was that it was fixed in every direction, meaning that to rotate or anything like that the whole thing had to be moved. And the other thing is that when I was adjusting the screen using my keyboard from the Windows 10 computer, the screen would just pop up and show me the brightness scale going up and down, but it actually wouldn't change the brightness. So, I was a little confused, but then I figured out that to adjust the screen, there are actually buttons at the bottom part of the screen which I can use to adjust the brightness. But I do not know why the command from the CPU didn't work.My CPU which I bought with this product by itself had a problem. So, when I returned that, I decided to return this.

Sure it was $15 more but it had an HDMI port, which in my opinion should be on everyone's list when buying a new monitor now a days.  Sure, you could go with one that just has a SVGA port for a couple bucks less. Maybe your computer has a SVGA port, you have an adapter, or you planning on investing in a docking station. I still think you would be better off having the HDMI port. You will never be able to get the kind of picture out of SVGA that you get with HDMI and in a couple years Goodwill will be about the only place you can unload monitors with SVGA only.

Once the tower was built, I plugged in my computer (HDMI from the graphics card interface), and was greeted with the message ""input not supported"". After some research, I learned that I needed to update my display drivers to output HDMI, but, in order to do that, I'd need to get the machine running and install windows, and to do that I'd need to use a monitor. I could have used the Mini DP output on my graphics card, but I learned that the monitor didn't have a Mini DP input. Several hours later, with the help of another borrowed monitor, I was finally able to update the drivers and use this one. All that toil and trouble to see an adequate picture, at max brightness.In short, if you need a Mini DP port, don't use this monitor. For everyone else, this is a good choice for starter monitors, but don't hope to get a great deal.

I then hit Fn F8 to select extend screen and I was up and running.The only issue I ran into was my laptop speaker stopped working after a few minutes.

The colors are fairly bright and vivid, and it makes for a great makeshift TV.*Size - 21.5 inches is big enough for me to be able to do my work more efficiently, and it's not too big that I can't fit it on my desk. It may run a little small for other people, but I find it to be the perfect size.*Value for money - I think it was at a great price (around $75) and I can definitely justify my purchase as the monitor both looks great (slim profile reduces bulk drastically and makes it a great fit on my desk) and feels great to use.",

The connections to the base is really strong (it's not clip on plastic, there's a metal locking system w/screw at the bottom for a solid connection). The size fits my heritage desk perfectly.

Really, everything else is good or was something that I simply forgot about, tilting was only a slight nuisance, as long as you focus on even pressure and pressure on the base plate, you avoid any scary sounds.",

It gets brighter than needed and the bezels truly are quite thin making it feel as though its larger than it is, in my opinion. The menu is easy to use and the power light indicator flashes if you leave the monitor on, however it isn't bright enough to be bothersome and screen goes completely black (as if it were off) when no source is detected. It's refresh rate is good enough if you play games and the colors are great too.

Acer guarantees fewer than six dead pixels on this size of display, and it's not in the way, so I'm not too fussed, even though this is the first display I've ever bought that had any. (This is also the cheapest display I've ever bought.) There's a bit of bleed-through at the bottom-right, where the controls are, and pressing the bezel near the controls flexes the screen enough to affect it. It might be possible to damage the display by grabbing the frame there while you're adjusting the controls, which would be my natural inclination. After adjusting the contrast and brightness, it looks pretty good. I could definitely watch movies and do normal tasks on it.",

I think this is because the monitors seem to have built in bezels that keep it from being truly ""bezel free"".

It does not have a speaker either. However, given what you pay for, this monitor is a beast. The IPS panel has amazing colours and a full HD resolution, which is good enough for 21.5'' size because the monitor is small so the pixel density is increased. It is also bright enough for sure. The stand is about as basic as it gets so the screen can only tilts a bit but the height cannot be adjusted. But again, you are not paying that much so no complaints there. It is a great package for people on a tight budget but want to have a good experience with a monitor bigger than their 13'' laptop.",

I've NEVER had a monitor failure of any kind on a monitor less than 10 years old. What are the chances that I have another very early death? Isn't Acer a good company?Well, apparently the odds of another failure are 100%. I received my new Acer SB220Q on July 28. This morning, September 8, it died during use, exactly as my first monitor did. There are definitely some substandard components inside this model. Now I have a 13 year old monitor plugged in as a temporary substitute.An LCD monitor should have a guaranteed 10 year lifespan, not less than 2 years. Even a monitor that lasts only 3 years would be a travesty. But I have purchased two Acer SB220Q monitors now.

So far this has not presented any issues with quality so I'm pleased with the results of running these in dual configuration.

But it can arrive dead, and if it does you may have to pay.Update Later Same Day: I got home after 8~10 hours randomly started working/started off green? but other than that worked as intended. Its specs are amazing, menu great, and most improtant looks amazing. However, you lose on the moveablity of other more expensive monitors",

It is very light and thin. There is hardly a frame bezel, and if you were to place two side by side it will be pretty seamless.

You can tilt and rotate the monitor. It doesn't come with VESA mounting holes so if you want to attach it to an arm that will not work.

When that happens, I need to adjust the cable/monitor and so far it has been working (less than a week that I had it). I know it's monitor's fault, and not cable's fault because the same thing happens with my VGA and HDMI cables as well as with VGA cable that it came with. I'm too lazy to return/replace it and it's possible that very soon the screen will be messed up permanently and reconnecting cables won't help.

It was 1080p, 75hz, and 21.5 inches. The monitor was 21.5 inches, yes, but I have never seen a more strange border around a screen. The border was about a 1/2 inch thick, and about an 1/8 inch on the bottom. Less of a functionality thing, more just poor aesthetic. However, this monitor was not 75hz, and that was a big problem for me. I went to display settings, the highest refresh rate setting was 60hz. I tried overclocking, and it topped out around 70hz. This was the second time this has happened to me. The first time I let it slide because I needed a new monitor, but this time I was very frustrated. I saw everywhere, ""1920x1080, 75hz"". And if that means 1080p runs at 60, and other resolutions can run at 75, then don't put those 2 numbers anywhere close to each other. And, additionally, the monitor itself was just bad. The monitor flickered, when I moved my mouse it would have a weird white tint, and when I was just scrolling through a webpage all the text would get a weird shadow while scrolling. The only reason I gave this 2 stars was because it was 1080p like advertised.",

HOWEVER, the monitor itself is hard to adjust brightness and display settings due to unlabled buttons below the monitor, it is sort of touch and guess with trial and error of what controls what, but you should not have to touch it much after the initial set up. For gaming on a budget, this monitor is excellent!",

The monitor I received had a large white bleed out from the bottom left side and the pixels were very visible from your typical desk length when watching a video--Haven't had this issue with other monitors of the same or larger screen size. Every time I watch a video or play a game, there would be a white glow covering the bottom left corner (approximately 5x3 in) which is very annoying and takes away form the experience.Hopefully you will receive a unit with less defects. It looks really slick.",

Even on HDMI it looks worse than a decades old VGA monitor. I bought it to use as a second monitor, mostly for text and chat apps and even for that purpose it's unbearable.Colors look incredibly pixelated, giving everything a ""screen door"" effect. You can notice it most prominently with light blue. What shows up as a solid light blue rectangle on my primary monitor shows up as essentially a series of vertical blue lines on this piece of junk.Secondly, the contract is absolutely horrible. It always has a washed-out look. Adjusting the contrast didn't resolve the pixelated color issue. There's a permanent hazy tinge to the screen that makes your eyes hurt.Anyone who reviews this monitor positively simply hasn't used another monitor made this century. Of the thousands of amazon products I've bought in my short life, this is a serious contender for the worst one ever.",

This monitor made me immensely happy, increasing my productivity and focus in the class and other endeavors.However, after about a month of having it, there were suddenly dead pixels in a corner of the screen, completely obscuring the right corner from being readable. Annoying, but I didn't have another $100 to spend, so I could deal with it. When I noticed these dead pixels, there was also a strange screen flickering, but it went away after a bit, so I ignored it. However, this was an omen because two weeks later the screen flickering became so constant that the screen was basically unreadable. I updated drivers, replaced HDMI cables, attempted to reduce electrical noise near the monitor... Some things worked, but nothing completely solved it.Which brings me to present day, where the second screen won't even bother to show my desktop anymore. Now it just flashes the Acer startup logo over and over again. I don't know why this screen decided to fail on me, but since it started failing outside of the return window I guess I'm just SOL.

Greenish pixels appeared all over the screen, which made it look terrible, especially when trying to watch videos. Checked all the connections and settings, couldn't find any issues. Googled around, and couldn't find anything on the internet either. Then about an hour after it started, it stopped. Only thing I did was *lightly* slap the back of the monitor (mostly from frustration) and the issue disappeared. My wild guess is that it was caused by a poor internal connection. I'm worried that the issue will come back, but it's been another week and no issues so far. I'll update this review if anything changes. Of note is that the return window is now closed - hopefully Acer will honor the warranty if it happens again.Also, there's no VESA mounting holes on the back, which is just an unacceptable oversight IMO. It would be super cheap and easy to add them into the manufacturing process, and without them, I'm forced to blow 20 bucks on an adapter to be able to use a mount. For a $90 monitor without a height-adjustable stand, it's really kind of a rip-off to not have them. Overall, I give this product a 3.5/5 currently, rounded up to a 4.UPDATE: The same green pixelated issue came back last week. Tried everything, can't get it to go away. Monitor is essentially worthless now. I'm looking into the product warranty. STAY AWAY from this product, and spend a little more to get a reliable brand.",7 people found this helpful

The colors were always a little muddled, but since I was using it as a secondary, it wasn't bothersome. However, I have owned it for less than a year and anything left open for even a short time (less than an hour) is burning afterimages onto the screen, even my desktop image is burning. Each time this occurs, it's taking longer and longer for the images to fade, in a few places it doesn't look like it will ever fade away. The screen overall is becoming rapidly grainy, I've never seen such a deterioration on a monitor before.Edit: After contacting their customer service and discussing their limited 3 year warranty (which does state repair/replace/refund options), they refuse to refund me purchase price, insisting instead that I send the monitor off to them at cost to myself for repairs. I do not trust that this would give me more than another 7-8 months before another failure. Will not be making a purchase from this company again.",

I have this hooked up to my laptop docking station for work which I use during the day, and it‚Äôs also connected to my personal computer for gaming and other personal uses. I think it‚Äôs safe to say that it couldn‚Äôt handle that amount of usage. Now I have to use my tiny laptop  screen for work and have no display for my PC until my replacement comes in. So if you are like me and constantly using it, might be more worth your time to shell out the extra cash for a better quality monitor. Luckily it broke in time for me to return for a refund.

It has a lot of trouble connecting with my thunderbolt 2 port (only this monitor has issues, I use this port on many other displays with no issues). Also makes give you the feature to split the screen between windows and adjust where the split is but if you split the screen on this monitor, you can't adjust the split and both screens are usually unusable. You have to gather the windows are your laptop display to be able to adjust then constantly move it to the other display until you get the right setup (as soon as you change applications, you have to start over again). Really inconvenient. Lastly, the brightness hardly adjusts down. At the lowest setting, it's still much brighter than other monitors which makes it hard to use if you work at night with the lights out.Maybe for really casual use, it would be okay but if you're serious about work, then don't buy a monitor that limits the functionality of your machine.",One person found this helpful

"Acer 21.5 Inch Full HD (1920 x 1080) IPS Ultra-Thin Zero Frame Computer Monitor (HDMI & VGA Port), SB220Q bi",2.0,Base connection to monitor does not secure well.,"Reviewed in the United States on June 12, 2019",,True,I found that the snap in connection of the base to the monitor is not secure. Handling or moving the moniotor while only holding by the base is dangerous and as in my case caused the monitor to come apart from the base and fall to the floor and breaking the screen. When you put the base together to the monitor it sounds and feels like it has connected well (snap in) but will not stay together well if any other direction of force than down is applied. Even after i got a replacement and knew about this weakness it still was dicey moving the monitor. Be careful. Other than that the picture quality is good and it works well.,One person found this helpful

We are collecting the parts slowly but surely.  I am not a computer nor gaming expert, but I have a general understanding of technology and whatnot.  I guess I would say I know what's good and not good.  We don't have the brains of the computer yet, so this review will be about the monitor alone.  I hooked up a Roku box to get an idea of the display.  I went to gaming channels on YouTube to see how they would look once we got this all together.First off, I am amazed at how thin this screen is.  On top of that it's feather-light.  Easy to assemble the stand.  It only has one HDMI port and one VGA port.  Is this enough for a good gaming computer monitor?  I'm sure I will find out later.  It would be bad for a TV, that I know.  The display is clear and bright.  Now understand I am looking at the display vs. a TV.  That's all I really know.  I'd give a sharpness victory to a decent HDTV.  This monitor's display looks good, but I feel it could be better.  Once I got the gaming video up on the screen, I felt the monitor did complement the game more.  This could also be indicative of the Roku box I was using as well.Speaking of which, the monitor has specific pre-sets just for game, such as ""racing"", ""action,"", and ""movie"".  This I liked.  I need my monitor settings as simple as possible.  I don't want to have to fiddle around with warmth, sharpness, and things of that like.  Overall I like it.

See update below.,"Reviewed in the United States on April 11, 2019",,False,"First I want to say I gave it one star for gaming because I have NO IDEA how it is for gaming.  Had I been able to skip that rating, I would have.  Color seems fine, screen quality seems fine.  However, my desktop comes up with 1-1/2 blue lines on the left and right hand sides.  A thin blue line at the top of my desktop picture.  And some kind of ""ghost"" just above the system tray gizmo that's always at the bottom of the screen.  I called Acer tech support and got a very nice gentleman who could barely speak English.  His final conclusion was that the monitor if faulty and now I have to ship it back for repair or replacement.  The good news is I will be reimbursed for shipment and won't have to pay a dime to fulfill this annoying operation.  I read so many good reviews about this model, I didn't hesitate to buy it.  Right now I'm frustrated to the max.  I'm no techie and have no techies near me who could help me out, so I have to go with what the Acer rep said.  This monitor if very close to the one that died on me, and yet, after pulling up a program on hulu, I see I have 1-1/2"" black bars on either side of the screen.When this finally gets resolved, I will update--if I can figure out how to do that.  LOL.UPDATE 4-15-19:  I was pretty sure the problem was some setting in the monitor.  I emailed a brilliant techie friend of mine about the problem, including sending him screen shots of what the desktop looked like and what the setting for resolution said.  He said there was nothing wrong with the monitor. [Oddly enough, the screen resolution was set to properly.]  He took over my computer remotely, went into various settings--I have no idea what he actually changed.  He was moving the cursor around so fast, clicking on this, that and the other thing, that I couldn't follow the procedure.  After maybe 10 or 15 minutes, the monitor was working perfectly.  So much for Acer tech support.  I've upgraded the rating to 5 stars because now that it's working properly, I love this monitor.  Colors are bold, Iris Mini works well to block out ""blue light"" without distorting colors, text is in focus and as sharp as I'm used to seeing it.  All in all, I'd recommend this monitor.  I didn't see a review here mentioning the same problem I had, but I'd still give my recommendation with the caveat to have a techie friend available who can easily fix the same problem I had should you run into it.",
"Acer 21.5 Inch Full HD (1920 x 1080) IPS Ultra-Thin Zero Frame Computer Monitor (HDMI & VGA Port), SB220Q bi",5.0,Beautiful Feature-Packed Monitor,"Reviewed in the United States on July 13, 2018",,False,"For the price this is a great monitor IF you want it for gaming and IF you are OK gaming at 1080p.IMPORTANT: Since this is an AMD Freesync monitor, you should really only buy this if you have a Freesync compatible graphics card (otherwise you're paying extra for functionality you won't use).  That said, if you have one this should sync up with no issue (my RX 480 immediately recognized it as compatible).A nice bonus is that this monitor has a 75Hz refresh rate instead of the standard 60, which results in smoother gameplay if your card is capable of 75 FPS at 1080p.  The 4 ms refresh rate is nice (but also expected at this price point).  While this not being 120Hz is a bit of disappointment (120 Hz at 1080p is a current sweet spot for gaming machines), at this price its understandable, especially given the inclusion of Freesync.The monitor itself is very striking, with almost no bezels and a thin profile.  I personally love the look (there is even a fun textured circle pattern on the base), but its important to note if you use an monitor mounted webcam or similar.  Since there are practically no bezels that sort of solution won't work as well on this monitor.The monitor itself is an IPS monitor, which means great viewing angles and good color accuracy.  With my Spyder5Pro I measured 97% RGB, 70% NTSC, and 75% AdobeRGB.  These are good values for gaming and everyday use, but not sufficient for professional photography, videography, or similar.  The monitor also shipped with washed out colors - calibration made a noticeable improvement to the display.Overall I'm very, very happy with this monitor.  It includes all the right features at the right price, with nothing extra (i.e. no speakers, which is a plus here in my mind as it cuts down on the price and keeps the display thinner).  Beyond that, its stylish, fairly lightweight, and a breeze to setup with Freesync.My only complaint so far is the color accuracy out of the box - its still very pretty, but there being such a noticeable improvement from calibration is a bit disappointing ... I would have liked it better calibrated out of the box, without the need for professional calibration tools.",5 people found this helpful

I recieved this one from my parents for the holidays (I had it on my holiday list). Picture is quite good and clear and viewing angles are much better than the TN display on my last monitor and on my laptop. The monitor does rotate back about 15 degrees but the mechanism is very stiff which worries me (try placing your hands on the sides on the thicker portion).The bezels are very small on 3 sides, probably around a centimeter. The software for tuning the image is a tad laborious since all the buttons are on the rear of the monior unfortunately. I/O wise the monitor has a small laptop sized power plug, 1 HDMI port and 1 VGA port. The lack of USB or a second HDMI port is dissappointing, but it appears to be standard in this class.Honestly my biggest complaint is the glossy plastic finish on the stand. I HATE this finish if its not just an accent since it collects fingerprints, dust and scratches just by breathing on it. My Xbox One has a similar finish and it looks like I attempted to balance a live kitten on it (there are heavy scratches even under the rubber feat my hard drive sits on). Having a matte plastic base and stand would make this product much better.",

The screen has a flat texture which is excellent for any glare or lighting issues. With that being said my biggest upset is with the stand and mount options for this monitor. It sucks.. and big time.. for 1 the stand is integrated so much into this monitor that it can NOT be removed without damaging the screen. What do I mean? So my problem in particular is my monitor leans down on the left side (about half inch drop) which can be quite annoying at times esp for gaming. So my thought was to try and slightly bend said plastic stand to help correct the fault, then my screen flickered..in a very bad way, as if this bracket itself was pushing on the screen panel from behind.. huge problem.. and no vesa mount either.. which is also a con for me needing my monitor to be wall mounted. But I knew this going in. Budget and time. I needed a monitor and this did the trick but will not be a monitor I will keep or reorder in the future. Considering 7inch to 77 inch screens almost always have mounting options. Just silly for a current product to be lacking in something so easily fixed.",

Not a problem, my old speakers are fine, but it's an example I guess that this is quite a basic model, although it delivers what I want in a monitor---a beautiful screen with nice graphics, at a price that seems quite reasonable to me (I got this to test, but I'd buy it at the price listed for sure)  So I'm happy!",7 people found this helpful

Second, it‚Äôs a monitor not a TV. You don‚Äôt expect a monitor to have speakers it‚Äôs just common sense. Also no speakers isn‚Äôt a reason to give it 1 star.

That is that that it cannot take a VESA mount so it just sits on the desk on its little stand. The stand it comes with only allows a bit of tilt, so in order to raise and lower the height you must put it on a stack or risers (the right way) or do like a lot of folks and put it on top of small Amazon boxes or something similar. Some of you may work in a place that still has physical books you could use for this as well ...The reason, I think, that this otherwise nice monitor cannot take a VESA (four hole mount about 4‚Äù across) in the back, is that it was apparently designed to look as super thin as possible at the modest price point. As a result, there is not really enough monitor body to put screw holes into. This is one of those things that happens when someone designs something and then doesn‚Äôt have to actually use it when the prototypes come out (or ever). Looks neat with the thin bezel and very thin side profile, but since I actually look at the screeen of my monitor, use multiple monitors in my work area, and need to be able to adjust height, angle, placement, twist it around for visitors to see during meetings, etc. I need to have that VESA mount or a much more articulated stand like the old DELL monitors had. I could do with a bit less style and this one super functional feature.So, a five star (for the price) monitor made into a 3 star monitor for single screen users who need no mounting flexibility.

My monitor was delivered back to their facility per my FedEx tracking number, yet I have been unable to get a hold of anyone that can do anything about my issue. I simply get put into Chat Box Hell with a ""lvl 1"" agent who informs me that they can't do anything about my problem and I should try again later.I've sunk way too much of my life into dealing with these people and I've given up.  At this point, I'm convinced they're going to keep my money and never give me a working monitor. I will never buy an Acer product again and I will always associate their company name with the absolutely horrendous customer service and product quality I've received at every time of this miserable experience.",One person found this helpful

If you are looking for a great monitor, at an even better price point, don't pass this one up! You will not be disappointed.Please Note: If you are an avid gamer, this is not the monitor you want unless you need something to get by until you can get one with a higher Hertz & refresh rate.

The monitor is very lightweight, just 5 pounds .5 ounces (without cables) and not massive looking on my desk.Since my old 2010 MacBook pro does not have HDMI I am using a display port to HDMI converter cable.

Very happy with my purchase.Looking forward to seeing how this monitor displays with my upcoming AMD Ryzen build...Highly recommended, lightweight, and a great price.EDIT:  Enabled the NVidia graphics card on the 2010 MacBook pro running Linux 20.1 Cinnamon and now the monitor is displaying 1920x1080 flawlessly.  :-)",One person found this helpful

"Acer 21.5 Inch Full HD (1920 x 1080) IPS Ultra-Thin Zero Frame Computer Monitor (HDMI & VGA Port), SB220Q bi",5.0,Perfect,"Reviewed in the United States üá∫üá∏ on April 6, 2021",,True,Perfect. The setup is super simple just push in three parts into each other and its ready to go. The monitor comes with a VGA cable instead of hdmi though which my computer doesn't support but that wasn't a problem for me since I already had an extra hdmi cable for my tv which I just used instead. The monitor definitely tilts fowards and back and I don't feel like it's going to break either. The monitor is sturdy and it's just perfect.,
