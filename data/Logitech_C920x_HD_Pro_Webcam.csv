"Logitech C920x HD Pro Webcam, Full HD 1080p/30fps Video Calling, Clear Stereo Audio, HD Light Correction, Works with Skype, Zoom, FaceTime, Hangouts, PC/Mac/Laptop/Macbook/Tablet - Black",5.0,Solid webcam,"Reviewed in the United States on March 9, 2023",Style: Webcam,True,I needed a new camera for my streams and all of my friends suggested this as they use it themselves. The cameras quality is superior to what I was using before. The camera is wide view so you get a good range of image. The only thing I would say is a negative is that my computer automatically shuts down on its own sometimes (for reasons unknown still) and will cause the camera to glitch upon next use and the camera sometimes won’t work unless I unplug and plug it back in.  I’ve noticed this issue mainly with discord but haven’t tested it elsewhere. It will freeze the call and not turn on unless I do as stated above. Slightly annoying. But still a solid webcam despite my slight issues. Would highly reccomend,One person found this helpful

It doesn't look like webcams have evolved much at all in the past 15 years, so this camera appears to be as good as any available.However, the auto focus doesn't work very well at all.  Many times my camera is out of focus and I have to move around until it re-focuses.There is no privacy cover included.  The base for the camera is terrible for two reasons - 1) I have new monitors with very slim edges and this camera's mount is thick enough that it covers the top edge of my viewing area on the screen.  2) The mount doesn't seem to double as a traditional desktop stand.  Maybe I'm just missing something, but I don't think it can just stand on the desk in a good way that doesn't require a separate tripod stand.Overall, this feels like another mass-produced product with very little thought put into the design and execution.The worst part is that I don't think it's worth returning it because I don't see any other webcams available that look like they've evolved past the 90's designs.  Literally every laptop I've used with built-in webcam has worked better than this camera.I don't recommend this camera for the price.  It might be ok if the price were around 80% less than the current price.  It's really very basic and just performs adequately.",50 people found this helpful

All three cameras stream video at 720p unless you are using Zoom, in which case the C920 is capable of 1080p. C270 captures less background due to smaller sensor, not as good if you are trying to record an activity or more than one person but better if you are trying to only capture your head and shoulders for work meetings.I ordered the LifeCam Studio($64), Logitech C270($22.99), and Logitech C920x($59.99 with $10 'limited time' discount) cameras to compare. All three cameras worked immediately upon being plugged in on a Windows 10 Enterprise laptop from Dell. I will be posting this review on all three cameras.All three of these cameras stream at 720p using WebEx, and indeed the fine print on the LCS and C920 state '720p video calls', so they are not capable of streaming at 1080p despite the 1920x1080 sensor (C920 can do 1080p with Skype only). My limited testing was using the drivers Windows assigned upon plugging in the devices in a relatively high-light environment. I will update with observations in low-light scenarios.C270: The cheapest of the cameras with a 1280x720 sensor, this camera had the worst color accuracy but surprisingly decent picture quality in terms of sharpness considering price. As seen on the photos, there is a blue tint to the image but that may not be the case in low-light environments with warm light. Since it has a native 720 sensor, it looks a little more zoomed-in than the other two, but that means less background which I actually prefer. ** I'm cheap when it comes to equipment I'm buying myself for work and the other cameras didn't offer sufficiently better performance, so I'm keeping this camera. **C920x: Best color accuracy, best picture. You can tell it has a 1080 sensor as there is a lot more background than the C270, I don't want more background so this is a tick against in my view.Life Cam Studio: Color accuracy is off, in high-light environment it gives a reddish tint and makes my face look like I'm flushing.. but you can tell I'm not from the other pictures. Again, 1080 sensor includes more of the background which I didn't want for WebEx meetings. I was also disappointed with the auto-focus, picture is a little blurry even after auto-focus does its thing (which is sporadic, I was blurry for a while before it did anything)",33 people found this helpful

I am a zumba instructor and  I didnt have issues with focus  .  I was taking another instructors class a couple of hours ago. The light came right on right before her class when I was in my own meeting to test it out. I may need a mic for teaching my own classes but they seemed to hear me fine after her class. Just for clarity with my intro and after class speech I might upgrade. It is hard to hear other instructors whatever they have  so ill do what I have to do. It look amazing clear compared to yesterday in my bedroom. I will teach in the family so I see how that does. It semed to show more of my room like movie bluray movies behind me and the window a bit more. So may be that is the wide view. On there screen I didnt notice it as much. Maybe when they share the screen. I wasnt really looking I was dancing . I just saw how much brighter I was and the colors were hitting perfect. I turned down the brightness on my PC. So I took the glare  off . No washed out colors . Everything seemed pretty clear and true to my outfit and skin tone. I even could see the hair on my face well. As another reviewer said. I shaved before class. I had whiskers everywhere.  It really picks everything up. Dresser was deep brown. My lava lamp was on point. I could see the top of it. I have that good view now. The computer cam seems dark in comparison. And with the adjust to low light on. Or should've been on.Update: The camera comes on in camera mode if you click on the camera in the upper right corner. It switches from your installed computer camera. So It works that was and on zoom. Previously it just said audio in the settings with no picture . No image. Then it came on zoom and looked perfectly clear. Now it works on both. Camera and zoom.,

Great price too at a time when webcams have become like Bigfoot...many reports of their existence but only a few people have actually found one lol.After reading from others I was a little concerned about this being a legit C920. Many places around the web claim it's a Chinese clone but after receiving it, there's no doubt it's a Logitech webcam. The box has Logitech product code and Logitech instructions are included.I read one reply from a Logitech associate that stated the C920x is not an official product. That leads me to believe this is a promo item or something. Clearly it isn't packaged in a retail box designed for shelf display. It's no doubt a C920 though ith the addition of a free trial of Xsplit. I don't have any desire to try or use Xsplit but I'm happy I was able to grab a C920 cam for just $70, which is $10 lower than current MSRP and about $20-$30 lower than the camera is selling elsewhere.The only thing I can figure about other reviews here stating it's blurry or auto focus doesn't work is they either got a bad camera or need to change their lighting or settings. This thing is crystal clear! It picks up every line and blemish on my face so...it may be a little too clear, revealing my age lol. When dialed in under the right lighting, it picks up individual hairs on my head and beard stubble. If you have a good front light, placed just behind the camera and no overly bright lights behind you and you're having problems with the image or focus then I would suggest that you simply are unlucky enough to have gotten an individually defective camera....it happens. I use a 10"" ring light in front, a lesser bright fill light on the side and indirect, colored led light behind and the image is perfect! 1080 is nearly as good an image as my daughter's DSLR camera...

I originally bought this to use my larger monitor as my primary but not have my everyone looking at the side of my head during zoom calls. It's very easy to set up and the separately installable Logi Capture software works relatively well. It allows you to add effects like frames or text and digitally zoom in. You can then select the Logi Capture video feed in conferencing apps and will get the adjusted view. I use this to zoom in since my monitor is not as close to me as a laptop would normally be. However, I do not like that the Capture software is permanently recording (hence the blue lights on the webcam). There might be a way to have it automatically start when a zoom/teams/webex/whatever meeting starts but I haven't found it yet.Overall, picture quality and autofocusing has been good. I know one person who had issues with autofocusing but it turned out to be a hardware defect and they got it replaced. I know several who have had this camera for many years and my older, 1.5 year old camera is just as good as this new one.The original one I bought had a privacy screen included but this does not. That's unfortunate but easy enough to create a makeshift one. Plus the blue lights make it clear when the camera is supposed to be live.I have never used the speakers on this camera and generally do not use the microphone since I have a dedicated mic. In the few cases that I have, people have preferred it to the built-in laptop one which had a lot of static.The USB cable is adequately long so it will work just fine for desktop users. Unfortunately, the cable is not replaceable so when my cat chews through this it will be time for a new webcam.",3 people found this helpful

I teach online so my camera gets constant use. The image quality is terrific, especially after using the setup software to increase the camera resolution. The camera is plug-and-play, requiring no setup in either Windows or Ubuntu Linux. The only minor complaints I have are that images are dim in low light (make sure your face is well-lit from the front!) and that it occasionally re-focuses spontaneously and causes a few seconds of blurred video. But 99 percent of the time the image is excellent.Audio quality is very good too, but the microphone can be overdriven, causing distorted sound. This is seldom a problem for voice calls but if you're using it for something louder like an acoustic instrument you should turn down the microphone gain in either the camera setup or the application itself, and make sure from the person on the other end that they're not hearing distortion. With the mic properly set you get decent audio fidelity, no matter what your sound source is.My biggest complaint about this webcam has nothing to do with the device itself. It's too popular. It's almost always sold out at the Logitech store, and when they do make some available, they are snapped up by resellers who scalp them at a $15-$30 premium.

I was using another one I had bought on Amazon that was not a familiar brand and it came with no software. It was just a plug-and-play and I had no way to check the camera before my meeting. This camera comes with software (which I do not fully utilize but it has a lot of options) and I was able to get the picture as I wanted.What came as a really nice surprise was the quality of the microphone. My other camera could not cut out background noise. My home office has a pellet stove in it which can get a bit loud when the fire is roaring. I used to have to turn it off during my meetings which allowed my office to get cold so it was uncomfortable. I was using this camera and had a unplanned meeting and apologized for the stove noise in the background. The other person said they can only hear me and I'm coming through loud and clear. So that was a big win for me. It also cuts out my pets if they're not right next to me and in the other room.I also like the look of this camera and it's easy to tell when it's on and off. The picture quality is very nice and I never have any issues of a fuzzy/out-of-focus picture. I can recommend this camera to anyone who has a lot of video meetings with background noise. It's excellent!,

Unless, I'm overlooking something I don't see how you can move the camera view around (i.e. left, right, up, or down). If you can't, what's the point of having those arrows around the image on the screen. So, did some research and decided to use OBS Studio which works very well with this webcam.So, overall Logitech didn't disappoint when it came to the quality of the C920x.

When I needed an additional webcam for a laptop, I decided to get another one. When I landed on the page for the C920s, there was a new version available, the C920x. I decided to buy the newer version.The C920x looks identical to the C920s except that it doesn't have a privacy shade. When the C920x arrived and I plugged it in, there was no Plug 'n' Play download. When I went to the Logitech web page for the C920x, it said no software, no documentation, no ... etc.The C920x has VERY limited settings controls. The picture quality was terrible and with the available adjustments, I couldn't get acceptable picture quality.What did come with the C920x was a license key for a three-month license of XSplit VCam software, which would give me the controls I needed: brightness, contrast, hue, etc. I went to the XSplit website to find out more. Sometimes, it is helpful to read the 1 Star ratings, and the ones for VCam were pretty withering. And when a product gets 22% 1 Star ratings, that is usually a no-go for me.After more poking around, I found some advice from a reviewer that I will pass along:Go to the Logitech websiteClick on the Downloads tabDownload and install LogiTuneIt isn't as good as Logitech Camera Settings and Logitech Capture that came with my C920s, but it will give you the ability to adjust the picture quality.I would STRONGLY urge Logitech to end their agreement with XSplit and send buyers of the C920x the software that comes with the C920s.Update: You CAN find Logitech Camera Settings software on the Logitech website, but you need to look for it. If, in Support, you navigate to C920x and select Downloads, you won't find it. That's because the website pre-selects Windows 11.

Sharp image?  It was AWFUL.Ah, but there is a 'fix'—kinda'.  At least for the Mac:The big problem is not actually the camera itself, but the truly unusable software LogiTech provides to control it.If you download and use the LogiTech ""Camera Settings"" or the ""Logi Capture"" from the LogiTech website, you'll have nothing but trouble.  What a couple of stupid, inferior applications.  Instead, you need to find a 'third-party' camera settings app.I downloaded an eight-dollar app from the Apple Store (since I'm using a Mac).  It is called, astoundingly, ""Webcam Settings"".Now the camera works much better.  In fact... WAYYY better.  I even added a 'star'.Among other features in this Webcam Settings app, there is a ""sharpen"" tool.  This greatly helps clearing up the image.Two problems left to solve:1)  I have not seen any improvement by using 60fps instead of 30fps.  The motion remains blurry.To qote LogiTech Support: ""Logitech Capture is not compatible with Big Sur, any changes will not work on Capture. You may try third party app to adjust the fps. Thanks.""Yeah, thanks.2)  The camera still does not have the clarity of a real camera, and the background remains ""noisy"" with lots of grain floating around, even when the image is filled with light.~  ~  ~Ah, webcams.

I searched Logitech’s website, and could not come up with any useful software. I also searched the web and saw nothing. Maybe the webcam just can’t be adjusted in anyway on a Mac?My only other concern is that the front mount flange is long. On today’s almost borderless monitors this could be problematic. On my Dell monitor the flange blocked part of the top menu of the operating system on Big Sur/MacOS. Luckily I have a monitor light on the monitor that does not block the menu. So I just perched the webcam on the top of that monitor light stand, and it kept the menu by being obscured.On the plus side its low light performance seemed acceptable for the price.

Connectivity and setup was quick, easy, and intuitive, and rarely do I ever have a problem with the computer not communicating with the camera.",One person found this helpful

I suspect some driver issue due to a Windows Update that I could probably have figured out, but I figured it has been over ten years, so I should ""upgrade"" to the latest and greatest.I mention this because it means I have over ten years of experience using a very similar Logitech camera with the same software and in the same exact space with exactly the same lighting and thus have very realistic expectations of how the camera should work. I have also used built-in laptop cams in the same space without these issues.Here is a list of some of the horrible things about the C920x:- Image color balance, brightness, etc. are awful. On camera, my face is either glowing red or bright white rather than the correct, natural skin tone.- Auto-focus frequently gets confused and blurs everything out. It seems like me slightly moving will trigger this and then I have to make big movements in front of the camera to get it to correct the focus. I have coworkers who have the same camera and same issue and any time it happens, you know instantly what camera they have.- The app to adjust the camera settings for things like pan, zoom, color balance, brightness, etc. forgets settings often. With the old camera, I could zoom and pan in the settings app to get myself situated in the proper position and then any app I used would have this correct position. That works for a little while with the new cam, but it eventually reverts back. This is an even bigger issue given the above mentioned color balance, brightness, etc. issue as I can make this slightly better (but not as good as the old camera) in the settings app, but it'll eventually lose these tweaks and suddenly I'm zoomed out and glowing red on a meeting.- No driver or settings app updates in years. It seems like this camera has been abandoned by Logitech and they have no interest in fixing these issues.",9 people found this helpful

I made a crude but effective sliding lens cover out of a chunk of polyethylene I had in the garage.This is a very good webcam for money and quality is as expected by Logitech.",2 people found this helpful

The problem is 2 fold - (1) If you want to do any sort of customization (zooming in, focusing, exposure, etc.), it's quite a pain. I spent hours watching Youtube videos and researching how to change the settings before finally have to download and install software that finally let me change the settings. I thought I had overcome the issues, and now I was good to go ... However ... Problem number (2) ... Even after dialing in all my settings, the camera would continually ""glitch"" by randomly going dark, randomly over-exposing, going in and out of focus, cropping the image, etc. ... So, as I'm going live, it glitches, and I have to open up the software, reset everything, then dial it back in again. I went live on a live-stream 3-5 times in a row over 3 days, and there wasn't a single time it didn't have an issue while I was live-streaming that I didn't have to stop and say, ""Hold on guys, let me go fix this real quick"". To be fair, yes, once the glitches were handled, it worked great. But the fact that I had to do so much heavy lifting up front just to change a few settings and the fact that I have to overcome glitches on the fly every time I live-stream makes it simply not worth it. I'm now sending it back and either upgrading to the c922 or simply buying from a different retailer.

The issue is no software to turn off autofocus. So I picked up this Logitech 1080p thinking it would work better on my Windows 10.  Unfortunately, the light adjustment is not good.  I'm posting 2 pics showing how much better the MS LifeCam does with making the lighting look very natural and soft compared to what this new Logitech looks like.  Settings are identical for each camera. Is there any setting that maybe I'm missing here?  This lighting is too harsh and washed out.",3 people found this helpful

I have no complaints with the quality of the picture.The problem is that the software is apparently not compatible with Windows 11, which is what Logitech Support told me.The Logitech Capture software is decent software.  When I try to use it with Windows 11, it has a simple but extremely irritating issue of regularly adjusting the input volume to 100 without me changing it.  This is beyond problematic.  It could damage my output devices, so this is an unacceptable flaw.When I reached out to Logitech Support, they said that Windows 11 wasn't compatible with Logitech Capture.  They recommended that I use LogiTune instead.After spending a few hours with the LogiTune software, I have no idea what it's even supposed to do.  My audio input device isn't showing up, and I can't find a way to even record from the software.I don't even care about the video quality that much.  It's all about the audio, and it turns out that my input device, an Audio Technica AT2020USB+, isn't compatible.  This is not only an extremely common condenser mic, but it is one of the two gold standards when it comes to condenser mic products.And LogiTune doesn't support the other one, either.So now I have to decide whether I want to buy a new camera that hopefully comes with some modern software that I can actually use, or if I want to actually buy some software that allows me to use the camera.",7 people found this helpful

There's a way to add on software where you can disable it, but what's the point of having auto-focus in a camera, if the only way to trust the image, is to disable it?I give it only 2 stars because it does otherwise function.

The second photo is a photo taken from my 2021 Macbook Pro. Both were taken in the same room, same lighting conditions, about 2 minutes apart.Save your time and money.

First, this is a very bad workaround. The camera should just work with Zoom, Skype, Teams, etc. Second, there does not appear to be a logitech app for the Omni TV app store, so this won't even apply to my case.Original Post -I bought an Omni TV which is supposed to have Zoom capability. But Zoom isn't available in the App Store for Omni TV. Still Amazon suggested I buy this camera as an accessory for my TV.

I have read some reviews where people complained about the audio and that somehow other microphones weren't compatible for use with this camera. I use both the built-in microphones and together with outboard microphones. One of the comments on a review below said something about gold standard microphones not working? That makes no sense to me since I use Pro Audio Equipment with mine using XLR mics through and audio interface. But, again I still use the built in mic for teleconferencing. The complaints seem to be software related? Don't understand that since you really don't need software other than the drivers unless  you are doing videos... in that case you are, like me, using separately purchased production software. For Zoom and other teleconferencing apps its only a matter of selecting your audio/video sources (same with production software). You may select those sources independently though any software package out there. If folks are relying on the packaged capture software then that's the problem. Packaged software with a webcam is not intended for much at all. There is plenty of low-cost/no-cost video software out there that kicks the crap out of any basic package that comes with a webcam. I do seem to remember some quirks with the logitech capture software when I tried it but that's pretty normal for ANY basic capture software. It ain't written to make movies. I bought a webcam, not their software besides the driver.",

The capture software lets you pick to prioritize white balance or frame rate and I chose to sacrifice the frame rate so my neon backlighting is vivid! In natural light, it's no problem and the framerate is great. I don't stream, but I'd say it's casual streaming quality.Some people might not care, but I love how secure it is on my monitor.

Personally I think the Wirecutter and other sites oversell this as it pales in comparison to using a full fledged camera as a webcam. It is a bit better than the internal camera on a Dell laptop, but the mic is very poor in comparison, so I would rely on an external USB mic instead. This unfortunately is common across all webcams.Out of box, this has the best quality of any webcams I tested between Nexigo N660P which was about neck and neck with this, it it weren’t that the default settings and software were ultimately a let down. Make no mistake, the C920 is not the best camera at all, but it is the best and easiest dedicated webcam to use at its price point. Probably the Brio is going to be much better but it is also about 4 times more expensive.Also I do prefer to to adjust the settings just a bit to increase the saturation and contrast, otherwise it is fine and no one will notice or care much either way.I have purchased the C920S after returning this one since the S has the lens cover which is necessary for privacy. One thing no one mentions is that there is a slight Bokeh effect in the far distance of the image: this is good for taking away attention from the background and putting focus on you as the subject, but subjectively for image quality the N660P looks better because it has edge to edge sharpness.I only kept this over the N660P because the default settings were acceptable while the N660P default were a bit bad. This itself makes it easier to use because most if not all webcams will reset to default after the computer is reset which is a critical issue - the only resolution is a bit of burdensome programming, or a proprietary software that may or may not be available or even recommended.",3 people found this helpful

I am using it with an M1 MacBook Air in clamshell mode. I sit about 2 feet from the screen and have a huge amount of light. I am always slightly out of focus. It also loses focus quite often and starts seeking around the room. There is little backlight to confuse it and I am much closer than the background. The $20 camera with fixed focus at least didn't have this issue. If I move my face within 1 feet it will actually focus and I am given a tantalizing glance of how good the camera could be. Then I sit back into a more normal position and it loses it again. I even tried paying $8 for the webcam settings app on the Mac App Store. That allowed me to turn off auto-focus. Unfortunately, even in manual focus, it can't focus on me sitting 2 feet away. What a waste of money.Update: Via web chat I had a rather frustrating conversation with Logitech customer service. Eventually, they told me I probably had a dodgy unit, so should get it replaced. I ordered another and compared the 2. No discernible difference. Neither can properly focus beyond about a foot. I will keep one of them, as there doesn't appear to be any better options on the market. Don't expect this thing to be very sharp though. Hopefully another company will invent a camera that can focus properly.",2 people found this helpful
