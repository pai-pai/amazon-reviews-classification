"Seagate Portable 2TB External Hard Drive HDD — USB 3.0 for PC, Mac, PlayStation, & Xbox -1-Year Rescue Service (STGX2000400)",5.0,"Lightweight, Fast, Portable","Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on April 3, 2023",,True,"I really love this hard-drive!Pros:The storage capacity of this hard drive is truly impressive. I was able to back up all my important files, including photos, videos, music, and documents, with plenty of space to spare.The transfer speed is very fast thanks to the USB 3.0 connection. I was able to transfer large files, such as high-resolution videos and RAW photo files, quickly and easily.The hard drive is very lightweight and compact, making it easy to carry around with me. I appreciate that it doesn't take up much space on my desk or in my bag.The design of the hard drive is sleek and modern, with a brushed metal finish that looks great. It matches well with my Mac mini and other devices.Setting up the hard drive was extremely easy. I simply plugged it into my MacBook Pro and was able to start transferring files immediately. I didn't have to install any software or drivers.The price of this hard drive is very reasonable, especially considering the large storage capacity and fast transfer speeds.Cons:While the hard drive isn't particularly loud, it can be a bit noisy when it's in use. I noticed a slight humming sound when transferring large files.The hard drive doesn't come with a protective case or cover, which could be a concern if you plan to travel with it frequently. I would recommend purchasing a separate case or sleeve to protect it from scratches and damage.This thing provides plenty of storage space and fast transfer speeds, making it an excellent choice for anyone who needs to back up large amounts of data. The hard drive is extremely lightweight, compact, and easy to use, with a sleek design that looks great. While the noise level and lack of a protective case are minor concerns, they do not detract from the overall quality and value of the product. I would highly recommend the Seagate Portable 2TB External Hard Drive HDD to anyone in need of a reliable and high-capacity external hard drive.",18 people found this helpful

He wanted an internal storage unit but I talked him into this one. It is external but he won't be moving it around. Also preferred this price over the others.He figured out how to move the games over pretty quickly after plugging into the unit. You can move more than one over at a time so he loaded up 4 and it came up 100 min to move! Frustration #2. Frustration #3 was accessibility of those games and loading them back to the console to play. He didn't belive the games could be accessed when they were on the storage device.  So I talked him into lunch. :) Somethings they just need to experience the whole process to understand.Come back with a happy tummy and the games are moved over. He also figured out how to access/play the ones saved on this device so now we have no more frustration. Woo Hoo! Lol!Yes I would recommend this storage unit and my son really would too, but he won't tell me...I overheard him telling a friend about it.",50 people found this helpful

"Seagate Portable 2TB External Hard Drive HDD — USB 3.0 for PC, Mac, PlayStation, & Xbox -1-Year Rescue Service (STGX2000400)",4.0,It will work for Mac running Monterey,"Reviewed in the United States on December 28, 2022",,True,"Like many others I could not get the computer to recognize the drive and the as I procrastinated one day it just showed up - there are answers for that so I am going to skip to how to make it work for your Mac running Monterey. The Seagate drive is made for Windows but if you reformat it by erasing it it WILL work. So, go to Disc Utility and select the Seagate drive and erase it by first naming it, the format it as Mac Journaled, then, and this is the important part, select Guid Partition Map.If for any reason the erase fails it's because your system preferences are open, just restart the computer after closing all the windows that are open. Then the erase will work, that is how it gets formatted for a Mac.Now go to Time Machine and select the Seagate that  you have named (I named mine the name of the incredible tech support person at Seagate) and tell it that you want to replace whatever you had before with this new one.So, I had a Seagate drive that I bought in 2019 that just stopped working one day. My tech support guy told me to always eject the drive by dragging the icon down to the trash when it's not in use - then it will last a long time. Power surges kill them, mine died when I turned off the computer in the middle of something in a panic over what I thought was a breach. It was nothing, but the little drive never worked again and so only 3 years later I had to buy another, but I will be more careful.Anyway, I hope this advice works for you but if not the tech support people at Seagate are great.I took off a star because there is no info on the website and none came with it either.",62 people found this helpful

Works with android even tho it says its for windows. All you need to do is format it for android. Which is very easy to do. Slightly bigger than a playing card. Very light. I would recommend buying a case to protect from shock or drops. The shell is hard plastic with no drop protection. The only thing that would be a con ""for me anyways"" is that the cord is very short and you will need an adapter for usb to usb c. Does not come with any adapter. Receives power from device it is plugged into. So you can plug your android phone in and it will operate fine. It says it has Bluetooth as one of the connections. It does not have Bluetooth or wifi that I have found which is fine for me.",9 people found this helpful

It is not uncommon for a PC to expose both USB2.0 and 3.0 without labels: which can cause unexpected slow transfers.The drive isn't to be roughtly handled and while operating should not be moved or touched (although I have a little without consequence).The drive takes longer to write than read:  this is in the advertised specifications to see plainly - it does exactly as it said it would do - precisely.Read the pre-purchase specs:  Drives do not come formatted ""especially for you"".  They absolutely must be preformatted with one filesystem only:  due to microsoft apple ubuntu (and others) in a kinda war - it's likely the format may need reformatting before use.  Seagate has no magic to know ""which you need"" nor could they:  this ""war"" includes hiding formatting specifications.",

I've had it on one spot for a whole year and I dont travel with it. It sits on my desk plugged into my computer. However, due to some sort of software or technical issues, I have not found the answer to as of yet, all I know is that it is not my computer's issue, its the hard drive's issue. Nothing is wrong on the computer end. But for some reason it likes to ""time out"" for lack of a better term. Randomly, and that's what's annoying about it, I could be using it for work and it just shuts off on me. Leaving me to unplug and replug. Several times a day. Nothing happens to it, it does it all on its own. Due to me unplugging and plugging back in so many times a day, obvioulsy the cord was going to wear.

So, for over $50, I dont think this is a good product for the money. For over $50 I expect the device to work properly for one, and two, the cord should hold up  more than a phone charger holds up. Maybe its the plug design on the device. I dont know. But something needs to change, because this obviously isnt working. I'm disappointed in this product.",4 people found this helpful

"Seagate Portable 2TB External Hard Drive HDD — USB 3.0 for PC, Mac, PlayStation, & Xbox -1-Year Rescue Service (STGX2000400)",5.0,"Slow, Reliable, & Shuckable.","Reviewed in the United States on January 24, 2023",,True,"I'm giving this 5 stars because it's a perfect back-up drive to support 3-2-1 backup strategy. Some general notes and considerations below:1. These are SMR drives, as are all 2.5"" hdd drives over 500gb. When these drives are new and empty, the write speeds are pretty comparable to other hard drives but as the fill up they do slow down a bit. If you are using these for backup and archival, you need reliable storage, not blazing fast speeds and these are great.2. These drives are Shuckable, meaning you can break open the case and take the hard drive out and use it in your own enclosure or laptop. This is important because if the drives USB connector wears out of breaks, you have options to recover your data and continue using the drive. Most Toshiba and Western Digital external hard drives have proprietary connections and can't be used in another enclosure, so if your USB port on those drives fails your entire drive is trash.3. High Capacity at low cost. You don't need the highest quality drive to protect your data, you need multiple decent quality drives so you can have multiple copies in case a drive fails on you. The price per TB of these drives is a great value.",37 people found this helpful

When they hit, it may be too late to rescue your precious files and digital photos. That's why I believe in backups, and the reason why acquired the Seagate Portable 2TB External Hard Drive Portable HDD – USB 3.0 when I had a fair amount of reward points accumulated somewhere.This is the second brand name external HDD that I've used of more than 500GB and the 4th one that I have used in recent memory (the other 3 were a generic one I assembled with a COMPUSA external HDD enclosure and a Western Digital 20GB HDD, the other was a SyQuest removable external drive (remember those?) and another brand-name 1TB). It's so small (smaller then my other 1TB drive) that it can fit in the corner of my emergency evacuation bag.The Seagate brand has been around since the birth of the personal computer era and, as both a user and a computer service technician, I had a history of generally good and reliable experiences with it. So, I was looking forward to a similar experience and, generally,  I've been pleased.Oh, I forgot: just when I recently opened the box it came in, it slipped from my hand to the floor, 2 to 3 ft. “Game Over!”- I though. So,... with some trepidation, I connected it to my Windows 10 Home laptop computer and, Voila! It worked! Just in case, I downloaded and installed in my computer the Seagate's SeaTools for Windows and tested it overnight: passed. I copied the contents of my other 1TB external HDD to it. Rugged, isn't it. No issues, so far.Once I registered it by running the “Start Here Win” routine from the drive, I got to download and install the “Seagate DiscWizard”, a nifty program offered as bundled to clone, backup and restore drives and data files. I ran an Entire Computer backup (the equivalent of a full backup) of my laptop and it did it in 11 minutes and 39 seconds: not bad. Then, I tested restoring by deleting an image file from my regular user account, rebooted the computer, ran DiscWizard, had to enter my administrator's password, selected Recovery (the software's term for Restore) and browse down to the file I knew was missing and restored it to my user account. That was easy, but,... DiscWizard won't allow for incremental or differential backups. On the other hand, every time you run an entire computer backup, the program overwrites the previous backup. If you are backing up or recovering a laptop computer, be sure that 1) its battery is fully charged and 2) that its connected to its own AC adapter and 3) “backup fully, backup often”.A worst case scenario of the Seagate external drive becoming non-responsive or missing part or all your backup, may call for Rescue DATA RECOVERY SERVICES, included with the purchase of the drive. This is a plus (although, I prefer not to have to use it).I look forward to use it as my main backup device, while turning my other 1TB drive to a day to day external storage unit.

The 5 terabyte model is also an excellent deal (just five years ago i would have thought 5 terabytes of storage for only 110 bucks was completely insane!) and I may decide to get an additional 5 terabyte model in a few months, and repurpose my 2 terabyte drive for something else.  In a month or two I plan on buying a 2 terabyte internal SSD to install as a second drive in my PS5, and having both a 2 terabyte Internal SSD AND a 5 terabyte External HDD should future-proof my PS5 console for quite a while as far as storage space goes.This 2 Terabyte External HDD works wonderfully; I have loaded it up with all of my current PS4 games and still have a full terabyte left, and I have not noticed any loading slowdown on any of my PS4 games installed on it, including DooM (2016), Spider-Man, and Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night.",7 people found this helpful

BIG THUMBS DOWN!Edit - As I was going through Amazon to see if I could return this (after the 30 day window) I saw an area that helped to reformat the drive for a MAC. I *think* it's working now...only did one time machine backup so it's difficult to tell. Still not helpful that this information isn't available from the get-go, so a 3 star rating for this reason seems appropriate.",

You most likely won't lag but it's best to be safe. Also, Fallout 4 might be laggier if you install it on your EHD with mods running. Other than those specific games everything runs perfectly.

"Seagate Portable 2TB External Hard Drive HDD — USB 3.0 for PC, Mac, PlayStation, & Xbox -1-Year Rescue Service (STGX2000400)",5.0,Great portable hard drive at a decent price!,"Reviewed in the United States on March 15, 2022",,True,"I only buy Seagate or Western Digital products for my storage needs because they have never failed me. It's setup to run on Windows from the get go but I use Linux so I reformatted it to be more compatible. I have to do that with every portable hard drive I get but the process doesn't take long. It does have extra software on it but even if you use Windows you can remove it to free up more space on the drive. I'm not sure if you would have to reformat it for a Mac or not. Maybe check the description and see if its Mac compatible. I would think it is but I may be wrong. 2TB of space is a lot more than most people actually need but some of us have years worth of stuff we like to save. So if you have a lot of music, movies, documents, pictures etc, this would be ideal for you. Just remember it is a standard hard drive so if you drop it, especially on a hard surface, poof goes all your data. Not every time, that is if you're lucky, but a lot of the time that will happen or there will be damage to the hard drive that can cause read/write issues. Solid state drives are more reliable but also more expensive. Anyway for a 2TB portable drive at around $40 something bucks isn't a bad deal. As long as you're careful with it and do regular backups. Don't want to lose your data in a computer crash!",

I used it for a 450GB Time Machine backup on a 2012 MacBook Pro, and Time Machine estimated it would take15 hours. It didn't actually take that long (more like 8 hours), but on my MacBook, the backup speeds nonetheless seemed fairly poor. For perspective, I can *download* 450GB over my 1 megabit fiber optic internet connection in around an hour. It's very possible the backup speed is limited by something in MacOS or something in the MacBook hardware, so I can't blame this drive with any certainty.  Plus I care more about reliability, which is an unknown to me until I've used it for around a year.",

The packaging really threw me off and just felt odd for Seagate.. almost as if it was fake.. but so far it seems legit. But for those saying “it’s not working for my Mac, or did not format right for Mac” they clearly didn’t do their research. The drive comes READY for windows because it’s the most used computer OS.. and regardless It’s ALWAYS recommended to format your new drive regardless of the OS. The drive should be formatted to MacOS Extended ( Journaled) and GUID partition because it works best with spinning disk hard drives. Nothing lasts forever, so make sure you back up your most important data, always. I’ll definitely update this review in the coming months.",2 people found this helpful

Both are literally priceless, at least to me.I notice that some reviewers have groused about transfer speeds, but for most of us that is not the highest priority. Moving pictures to the hard drive is a one-time affair, and who amongst us is old enough to remember when one left the computer run all night long?After a month’s usage, the files have been successfully retained, with no copy errors.I’m impressed that this one item has 186,000 plus reviews, the most I have seen for any product.

If you are a Mac user, I would recommend finding a different external hard drive to purchase for a simple plug and play purchase. To make this usable on your Mac, you need to follow a fairly detailed sequence of steps through system preferences on your Mac. This is definitely a ""tech native"" purchase for those under 40 years old and that have some familiarity with how to reformat external drives to be compatible with a Mac. For PC users, this is a simple plug and play for the most part, and you can drag/drop content very soon after installing. An additional hurdle for Mac users is that the default shipment is USB.

Takes roughly over night and to a day. Done.I do use iCloud for my mac products, movie making, etc.But, SLR photography and a bunch of stuff from my last HP prefer keeping hard drives. Plus, no need to leave any of this unnecessarily on the MacBook Pro 2021.Using this for business production and publishing so wanna keep it underwhelmed by ‘stuff’ and focus on exactly what I need.I like Seagate’s user-friendly storage. With an Aukey, I’m able to plug the old drives easily into the new mac C port.I use to use Carbonite for hard drive storage at a facility. Should something happen to the devices?With this, you have annual renewals for more than the price of a couple of devices and recovery fees. This is a great option if you live in a flood zone or are not comfortable using a device like this.It’s my opinion these have gotten simpler and easier to manage, so it's a preferential thing for me at this point.I'm buying another because I've filled up a one and two TB backup. Want one for just the HP. Mostly RAW photos from pro photography shoots.I recommend this device if you need a simple to use hard drive for all your data, photos to valued work.Makes it very easy to use between devices without them loading down their hard drives.⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️💯",One person found this helpful

It greatly increased the storage of my game console although I had to use one of the only two available UBS ports. So far I have no complaints about it; the unit was easy to install; the PS4 recognized it immediately, but I had to change the settings so the PS4 used the portable as the primary storage unit and only after the PS4 reformatted the unit. Afterward I had to uninstall some of the games and reinstall them again so the PS4 would store the data in the new drive but with that out of the way, I was able to then reinstall many of the games I had to remove previously because of the lack of storage space. It's a good buy, I do recommend it. Please remember that this is is not an SSD but a hard drive.Pros: Plenty of storage, easy to install, very quiet (not totally, of course).Cons: Not as fast as an SSD.On a side note: I recommend you consider adding a battery backup (UPS) for your PS4 to protect the drives from damaged in case of brownouts or sudden blackouts. I bought a small battery backup unit for 40 US from Amazon, since 2 TB is just too much data to lose.",3 people found this helpful

Seagate, your technician should have mentioned this when we troubleshot the problem.Initial ReviewI partition 2TB hard drives into two sections: one for Time Machine and one for manual backups (multimedia).  Every three years I retire the hard drive and start a new one so I have backups for over a decade and I have reliable hard drives.

I tried two methods, two formats, two different OS computers and one Windows computer.  I swapped out the cable and how it connected to the computer.  There was no signs of damage to the box or to the hard drive.  I reinstalled NTFS for Mac, per Seagate's recommendations.  I chatted for 15 minutes with Seagate before we both decided to return the hard drive.  I'll go back to Silicon Power for the replacement.",4 people found this helpful
"Seagate Portable 2TB External Hard Drive HDD — USB 3.0 for PC, Mac, PlayStation, & Xbox -1-Year Rescue Service (STGX2000400)",3.0,Very touchy and easily disconnected,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on March 18, 2022",,True,"The connector to the drive's body is wiggly and the drive gets disconnected too easily. Even a slight movement of the cord causes it to get disconnected. This has already resulted in a partition that cannot be mounted [wasted space]. In fact, I'm fortunate I partitioned the 2 TB drive into 2 1 TB partitions before I started using it. I can only get one partition mounted. For the one that is corrupted, I had to go in and create another volume, which ends up isolating the used portion of the bad partition so that I can at least use that space.However, the easy disconnection is a real pain and risks damaging the drive. Very sad, since you never know if it will disconnect.Also, as others have mentioned, it's very slow. The cable might be the problem. Next time, getting a flash drive to time machine my mac.My advice: as soon as you can, partition the drive so if one section turns useless, you can still use the other partition. The useless volume sometimes appears and most times does not appear when I connect it to my Mac. Use DiskUtil to set up at least two partitions (not volumes). Use one for time machine and format the other exFAT so you can use it both on Mac and Windows. The exFAT partition seems more resilient than the APFS side. Once the APFS side goes bad, add additional Volumes that can use the space that is still good.",One person found this helpful

I like having redundancies, so I won't be clearing out the flash drives any time soon, but this puts my mind at ease that my documents are safe in yet another place. The drive works as it should and I've had no issues storing or transferring files from one machine to another. There was one hiccup: The drive must be formatted before you can use it and the pre loaded files that should walk you through that process were not compatible with my device. I was, however setting it up on a Macbook Pro running Sierra, so that's more on me than the manufacturer. If you are using a more recent OS, I would assume you would be less likely to encounter this same issue. It wasn't too much of an inconvenience, because you can format the drive yourself using Disk Utility. I just had to google which format I wanted it configured in and it took just a few min.

We tested the speed of the drive and were shocked at how slow its write speeds were.  Read on for our test results and impressions--  THE TEST:  We ran LAN Speed Test which is a Benchmark speed test tool to test the speed of the  USB 3 port of our laptop to the Seagate drive using 4MB test files.--  SLOW WRITES TEST RESULT:  See the attached graph.  We saw about 21 MB/s write and 150 MB/s Read.  The manufacturer claims 150 MB/s but they dont tell you if its read or write.  A bit of marketing specmanship on their part. --  POOR INDICATORS:  There is a small HDD activity indicator on the rear top.  Very hard to see from its location and from its dim brightness.  Its shocking they did not light up their logo on the front as that would have been a much superior solution. --  NO POWER LIGHT:  There is no power light on either the adapter or the drive body.  So the only way to know if its on is to see the activity light when data is being transferred.  --  NO POWER SWITCH:  There is no switch on the drive to power it on or off. --  NO SIDE MOUNT FEET:  the feet are only located on the large area side.  Even though the disk will work fine on its side, they did not provide any feet on that side. THE GOOD:  -- RECOGNIZED IMMEDIATELY  The drive was  recognized immediately by Windows 10 and by Synology DS220J NAS.  --  SYNOLOGY HYPER BACKUP WORKS:  The Hyper Backup software had no problems using the USB drive as a destination.  The drive was just slow performing at about a 29 MB/s average  for a 3.5 TB backup. CONCLUSION:  The Seagate drive is molasses slow  with a very poorly located activity light.  It might take 1.5 days to complete but incremental changes after the first backup should happen within much less time.If you found this review helpful, you can vote ""Helpful"" using the button below.",4 people found this helpful

Not surprisingly, I was a little annoyed when it did not do what I expected, so that one is being returned.HOWEVER, I went ahead and repurchased the Seagate 2 TB external STORAGE hard drive, and when I plugged it in my PS4 recognized it as such (unlike with the previous one). It is just like it says it is: compact, portable, with additional space for the various platforms (including PS4 compatibility). And yes, it DOES come with a cord, as it very well should for sixty-plus dollars. Contrary to some other reviews, my cord was not faulty and fit snuggly into the PS4 port (3.0). You can refer to the attached videos and images if you want an idea of how securely it fit into the slot.",14 people found this helpful

"Seagate Portable 2TB External Hard Drive HDD — USB 3.0 for PC, Mac, PlayStation, & Xbox -1-Year Rescue Service (STGX2000400)",3.0,Be extremely careful with this device,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on July 9, 2019",,True,"Overall I like Seagates external hard drives.  Even though this is my 3rd one in 3 years...  The storage capacity, and portability are their biggest pros.  However there could be a lot done to the device to make it better.  First off you have to be very careful when handling this device, one drop, or it hitting something in your bag during transport, can, and more than likely will cause irreparable damage.  I have gone through three because of this.  The first one dropped less than a foot, hit the carpet, and quit working.  The second one hit my laptop while I was driving home, and quit working.  The third one I didn’t drop at all, and it randomly quit after 5 months.  Luckily they’re good about their warranties, even though the application on the website is a humongous pain in the ass.  I had to restart it over 5 different times because it would randomly take me back to the home page, and you couldn’t read or click on half of the parts.  Needless to say after 3 hours of trying, I stopped and contacted them over the phone.  The person who helped me was extremely nice, and apologized about the technical issues on the site.  The second thing they could work on to make it better would be to work on the heat issue, this device gets extremely hot after using it for hours.  Lastly they could make, or purchase a better usb2.0/3.0 cord; the ones they give you are absolute crap.  They last for a few months, 6 at most before they stop working.  My guess is it’s a cheap product purchased in bulk.  If Seagate would take the time to fix these issues, I believe they would have the best EHDs on the market.  Only because of the portability, storage capacity, and customer service do I give this product 3 stars.  Without those three things, I’d advise people not to buy them.  However I do warn people to proceed with caution, and be extremely careful when using one.",37 people found this helpful

The hard drive itself has a small form factor, an LED to indicate if it has power or not, and includes a cable to connect. The price is very fair for the value you get out of this hard drive. The setup was also very easy as most consoles identify when an external device is plugged in. I recommend using the hard drive to hold all your games, then using the system memory to hold all the save data.

I saw a few reviews that warned of the hard drive suddenly malfunctioning and losing all of the stored data. I thought it was probably just a few malfunctioning units and took the chance on this hard drive anyway. The price was attractive and it seemed easy to use. For $99 I guess you get what you pay for. I will say, this product worked PERFECTLY in the beginning and was just what I needed. However, none of that really matters when one day you boot up your Playstation and literally EVERYTHING is wiped. The worst part is, I can't even seem to repair the it in any way after hours of googling and trial and error. Worth noting, I am very tech savvy so if there was a way to fix it...I would've found it.  Now, I've just got a very expensive paperweight and have to download my entire game library again. Here's hoping I have my save files in the cloud. This is a gamer's worst nightmare. So in short, feel free to roll the dice on this harddrive... it may work perfectly for you. However, to me, the fact that it malfunctioned so early in it's life cycle and many others have had the same problem, this is simply unacceptable.

The PS4/PS5 only comes with about 1tb of storage, which is fine if you only play a couple of games, but if you want to play a bunch of games, you're going to need to expand your storage.This external hard drive works perfectly as a PS4/PS5 storage expansion unit.

Lasted me awhile for sure but awhile isn't good enough if it's an integral part of your system. And it didn't just quit on me. It made a whole 6 month long event about it where I'd have to find ways of appealing its whims because my charge cable for my controller had the nerve to slightly brush the cord the drive came with. Then there's the wonderful times where it would be connected and just decide that nah its not and I'm seeing things. I need to just unplug it and restart the console and hope it decides to work and need repair because it wasn't disconnected properly. Which every time I had to do that I was gambling since it could very well corrupt every file on there. I did that a lot. I'm not sure what I did to upset it enough to finally give up entirely but I'll be honest, we're both in a better place for it.

However, this hard drive was not recognized by my Patroit Box and Samsung TV using the cables that I have been using with other hard drives.  It finally worked with the new cable that came with the drive.  This drive probably needs a little more juice or something for it not to work with cables that work with about 10 other hard drives that are 2TB or larger.  Disappointed that this one is so unique that I would have to change cables which means it is not the same plug and play that I am used to with my portable hard drives.  This is not my first Seagate so it is disappointing that it is not as interchangeable as the others.  It is not worth the trouble of returning for another one which may have the same issue.  I wonder if this one is a one-off defect or a sign of what to expect from future purchase of this brand.  I am not going to bother experimenting this with my Roku Ultra or other streaming devices.  It's not worth the extra work to try it with every streaming device that I own.",

"Seagate Portable 2TB External Hard Drive HDD — USB 3.0 for PC, Mac, PlayStation, & Xbox -1-Year Rescue Service (STGX2000400)",5.0,Just installed in Tivo Bolt Works Great (by disassembling the Tivo Bolt of course),"Reviewed in the United States on February 10, 2019",,True,Just installed 2TB version to replace 500GB drive in my Tivo Bolt.  Keep in mind for those that don't know(to the best of my knowledge) Tivo only supports old models of esata hard drives of specific models).  This is a USB3 model that I disassembled and removed the drive to install in my Tivo Bolt.  I am not running Hydra but otherwise running latest software as of 2/2019.  Installed the new drive and booted Tivo without issue.  The Tivo Bolt will boot with this as a blank drive and install the OS on it's own.  Just as an FYI after prying the external enclosure apart the internal drive model is ST2000LM007.I still find it odd that drives in enclosures are less expensive that the bare drive.  But anyway this was much less expensive that purchasing a more expensive Tivo with a larger drive.  Tivo is still the best DVR.  Sad that I think we will see it go away as streaming is taking over.  I currently have satellite TV but am going to use this for OTA for local channels and streaming for the rest then drop satellite.  Hope someone finds this useful.,

I never received an email saying the new drive had shipped to me. Just an email about feedback from the call I made.  I contacted them through chat on the sea gate web site. He asked if I had received an email regarding a credit card authorization. I asked why would you need that. He didn't answer me. I told him I was supposed to get a replacement drive then I was supposed to send the broke one back. I was very uncomfortable about sending the broken drive back anyways because I had backed up all my info on to that drive and they boast recovering information off hard drives that are damaged. They said they'd send me a free return label but had to send broken drive back first. I have a problem with companies that change what they say in the first place so I'm just returning the drive to Amazon and getting a refund. I don't feel comfortable though because they still have the drive and everything from my computer is on that broken drive.

Recently it has started to have major connection issues. The connection port on the drive became loose due to the heat it produces (It shouldn't be hot enough to melt frozen wax in a few moments...) and will fall loose and disconnect without looking loose or disconnected. I cannot count the amount of time this has cost me on my projects as it disconnects immediately closing whatever program is accessing the files on the drives (i.e. crashing my programs...) and sometimes corrupting the files altogether. I have tried to contact Seagates customer support but I cant even get past the first step as the they require a serial number that is not even on the product.

This one however did not work out so well.I formatted it for the Xbox, I started downloading some games & randomly it would just stop & would no longer be recognised. The bigger issue is that it also prevented the Xbox internal drive from being recognised. I ended up doing several restarts of his Xbox as well as a couple of power cycles but it never fixed it.Just to be sure it wasn't his Xbox at fault, I tried it on mine. I re-formatted it & started to download a couple of different games & unfortunately I encountered the same issue on mine. I know my Xbox is fine since I have my own external drive that I've never had an issue with (mine is Western Digital,) so through elimination, it turned out to be this Seagate drive at fault.I may have received a faulty product, that's probably the case, but sadly I can't get a replacement through Amazon so I am unable to say with 100% certainty whether the product is fully compatible with Xbone, I can only get a refund. Not happy about this.For the record, I think Amazon refused to do a replacement because I bought this for $59.99 & after purchasing, it went up to $62. Personally, as a gesture of good-will, replacing it & foregoing that $3 would've been a better and more efficient way to appease a Customer & resolve an issue. For the first time, I am pretty disappointed with Amazon Customer Service. I would've been more than happy to have paid that extra $3 but I wasn't even offered that option. Amazon just lost Seagate a Customer because I am reluctant to buy another now incase I encounter the same issue & have to go through the same return process & wait again before I can buy something else. I'll get another WD instead. Sorry Seagate :(",6 people found this helpful

Only chat is left and chat support is horrible. I did get it to work but a 20 minute job ended up taking 2 hours. This disk will be used for Time Machine backup on a Mac.  Performance/speed does not matter to me, nor portability.  I have another Seagate still functioning after 3.5 years. Hopefully I never have to contact support again.",

Many drives you do have to reformat for Mac. But even in the drop down menu of erase in disk utility where you are supposed to be able choose a mac compatible formatting there was none.  I then followed all the self fix steps provided but with the same result.  The availability of the mac formatting was not there. The formatting type which began with A may have been meant to be for apple but none of those would time machine work with.  What happens then is it look like it is backing up your files but it never finishes the back up (not due to lack of size or space) just keep cycling.,2 people found this helpful

Eventually we started having issues getting the xbox to allow us to connect controllers to it. I did not even consider that this hard drive was to blame. We would have to restart the xbox a few times to get the connect button to function on the console.Finally we noticed that some of our content wasn't displaying on the console. I looked through the storage and noticed the external hard drive wasn't connecting anymore. Unplugged it, restarted console repeatedly. We tried everything. Finally we got it to connect and low and behold, the controller connect button no longer functions! I still assumed i was dealing with two separate issues.So about now I'm getting pretty frustrated with the whole situation. My external hard drive is trash, and my kid's less than year old xbox one x is apparently on the verge of becoming trash. I unplug the hard drive and move it to a different xbox to see if the storage or the xbox is to blame. Now imagine my surprise when the controller connect button on the second xbox now doesn't work. The hard drive doesn't work either. Everything works fine until I plug in this particular hard drive. And everything goes back to fine when I remove it.Do yourselves a favor and buy a better hard drive.Update - I have started the quest to see if it's possible to return this device back to whatever it came from. So far seagate has said it will not be a problem as long as I give them pretty much every piece of personal information that makes me who I am. They also want me to review their information privacy policy which makes me think that my information will very soon be for sale. I guess I'll just eat the cost of this one.",One person found this helpful

It's concerning both stopped being read consistently but not at the same time.  Trying to copy files for back up, the 2 TB started real soon after buying it, disconnecting repeatedly while copying data onto it. Then it would shut off completely not to be read again at all from the PC for a long while - weeks, etc.  I travel some so didn't realize it was literally a bad non-functioning external drive so didn't realize the problem was here to stay until after the allowed refund period.  Not too long later, the 1 TB started doing the same thing, so basically I got an Element external drive that ended up not working at al.  I spent over a couple hundred dollars trying to have secure back up for very important files. Don't go with Seagate or Element.... I just want a good working external back up drive, these are not reliable brands. My PC has a lot of RAM, like 16, and I-3 Intel. It's a good system.  These things you pay a lot of money for are supposed to be good systems, they're not.  Seagate should replace both these drives - I fear now they were 'offed' on us defective, sold so they wouldn't lose money, but to the point we would.

Starts at 100MB/s+ for few minutes, than drops to average 6-8MB/s for the rest of the transfer, with occasional bursts to 10-30MB/s. 1.5TB of data is now estimated at 21h to complete. This is on a fresh drive out of the box. Obviously SMR drive. Absolute waste of time.If you are using it to occasionally backup few files, you'll be OK, if you are thinking about transferring large sets of data frequently, look elsewhere.",3 people found this helpful

"Seagate Portable 2TB External Hard Drive HDD — USB 3.0 for PC, Mac, PlayStation, & Xbox -1-Year Rescue Service (STGX2000400)",4.0,PS4 works but usb 3.0 interrupts controller signal.,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on January 16, 2020",,True,Used for PS4 and worked as storage. The USB 3.0 actually creates a frequency that interrupts the ps4 remote. This caused the controller to constantly lag or have horrible response time when using the drive. Sadly USB 3.0 is the only kind that works so I had to hide it a bit. Might be good to get a longer cable to place it farther away but i don't know if it's the close or far end that creates the lag (though hiding it does seem to help).,

When it worked, it was so very slow, there is literally no reason for this drive to use USB 3.0, USB 1.0 is sufficient for the drive's read and write speeds. The USB3 thing is just a gimick, making people think the drive is faster than older USB 2 drives. I was being patient though, since I don't expect to use the drive for anything other than backing stuff up occasionally. And then after filling it about 1/3 full, the drive started giving ""unexpected device errors"" when trying to copy files. Even windows 10 disk scan failed, due to a device error. This error causes windows explorer to freeze up, requiring a reboot to make my PC functional again. Returning the drive.Yes I got really unlucky with this drive. No, you probably shouldn't expect the same thing to happen if you buy one. Its just dumb bad luck that mine died. I would have kept it if it didn't die on me (because I'm lazy and I hate dealing with returns), but it isn't good enough for me to want a replacement.

The second I tried to transfer games back onto my Xbox to play it would freeze the Xbox and not work. I tired to call to get the device replaced through warranty and they gave me the run around and now finally after only 6 months the hard drive doesn’t work at all. It beeps and won’t even show up on the Xbox! When this happened I read reviews and all I see is people having the same issues! Seagate is a  terrible company and they have terrible products.

Hard drive crashed within 3 months of buying it.  returning it to manufacture now.  It was supposed to come with one year data rescue in case it crashed.  and apparently that was bogus also.  This is a worthless product and I would not advise spending any money on it.WE have multiple PS4s, and are considering a PS5.  WE got tired of cleaning out games form the storage on the units we have, and decided to try a external portable device.  We were very excited, got it synced up, and transferred the game from the main PS4 consul to the storage drive.  Went back in a few weeks later to play one of the game we had transferred over,  my son and I had spend over 100 hours on it, and had lost everything.  Apparently the external only works if the games are played from it, it will not copy over any of the saves or game progress.  Which defeats the purpose of using this to make room on a consul without losing the games.  So big waste of money, and neither my son nor I am interested in playing our ""saved"" games anymore as rebuilding everything that was lost with the transfer isn't worth the time.",

A 1TB only holds 930GB. Any additional data will take time to fill this one.Transferring large amounts of data through a USB hub is inefficient and impractical. I've found they run on less power and therefore transfer much slower. The chances it can crash increase. I run a health check on all of my HDs at least every 3 to 6 months depending on who often I use them. After plugging it into the PC itself, the transfer rates increase.

I purchased this seagate external hard drive that states it's compatible with Macs. It downloaded about 1/3 of my pictures then I got an ""Unknown Error"" message stating it could not download the rest of the photos.  I called Amazon and was transferred to Seagate.  It turns out this product is made exclusively for Amazon- Amazon does not disclose this information.  Despite claims that it is  compatible with Macs it needs to be formatted to do so, there were no instructions that inform of this. Also the device cannot be located on the Seagate website. I called Amazon, was transferred to Seagate.  Over 1 hour was spent discussing my issue.  I did not want to simply return the device since it had several of my pictures on it.  Although patient, and ultimately not having to pay for a new product they were able to remove my pictures and will send me a new device, one that is made specifically for Macs.  I must send the original device back, without a refund, they are simply sending me a hopefully better replacement.

I discovered that inside is the notoriously bad rosewood ST2000LM007 drive. Google ""ST2000LM007 reliability"", these drives are known to fail w/out warning. Seagate's ""Enjoy long term peace of mind with the included 1 year limited warranty"" advertisement should have been a red flag. 1 year is ""long term""? What a joke from their marketing department. But 1 year is as long as they want to take responsibility for it, so that should tell you something. Don't use this for irreplaceable backups and/or as primary storage.Original review:Never had a drive fail like this, should have paid more attention to the negative reviews, but instead trusted Seagate's past reputation and previous experience. I purchased in Aug '19 and copied some data for backup purposes. I recently made a back up of one of my computers, and did the same for another today. I went to copy a few more things back and forth today and the drive failed with Win10 telling me ""drive corrupted, can't read it"". Properties show 0 bytes capacity and 0 used. Some of my data was temporarily only on this drive so there's a good chance that's gone forever.This product deserves zero stars. Seagate does not cover data recovery in their warranty - they should for drives that fail so quickly.One other thing - the case feels cheap. It's in a flimsy plastic case and has no rubber feet to keep it from sliding around.",

I have it plugged into my Mac by way of an Anker adapter. I have my Mac on my desk. As I slid the Mac from one part of the desk to the other, the drive and adapter fell off the table but did NOT hit the floor. It just dangled from the Mac.. that's it, that caused it to die.

Complete failure. Was using for xbox and I never disconnected it. Just one morning turned on the system and the drive no longer was able to be read. Hmm, only 6 months of use and only 25% capacity used. Tried to contact Seagate to get my drive replaced while it's still under warranty.  Digital agents are slow to respond, if they respond at all. I've had three attempts where I respond to chat and no response happens over 10 minutes. The bots that just walk you through a troubleshoot menu when you first connect are not even helpful, and when you call the number listed on the site, it gives you three ads, if you decline them, they just hang up on you before you can reach a representative. The warrant/rescue service is not real from what I have spent hours trying to get help with it. I would never recommend buying one of these unless you want a disposable drive that works for a month or so.",

Taking some advice online, I tried checking Windows Disk Management, and the drive wouldn't Initialize at all. When attempting to get it to initialize, it reported a fatal hardware error as the cause.Because of this, we've now lost data that's nearly a DECADE old, much less all of my music and videos are now completely -gone-.

Seagate did authorize a refund for the one that stopped working, but I asked if it would be better to purchase the model with the external power supply.  I was told 'yes'.  So I will purchase another one.  However, you can't return the 2TB unit with a totally damaged unit.  So I now have to warn my friend to be EXTREMELY careful about how he might disconnect the power cable when the unit is running.  Seems like a flaw in the design to me.  Having learned this, I should just be able to exchange for something with the external power.  Warning to anyone purchasing.  Look for the external power.

It should have removed previous material and updated to the new material on the computer, but stopped removing and wouldn't function. My computer then began giving me warnings that there was not enough space on my hard drive, so I thought I'd read through multiple reviews. Not sure why, but opted to purchase this one due to reviews. Bad idea. It would only allow me to transfer small files. It would freeze my entire computer, forcing me to power it down manually and then boot it up again to get access to my computer again. THEN, I would attempt to transfer the larger files and it would say that it was ""estimating time"". It would say this for hours. It would stop working if my computer went to sleep. I sat the first time for two hours keeping my computer from sleeping, because it said it would take 2 hours to transfer. 6 hours later, no dice. HUGE waste of money and time. Won't EVER purchase Seagate anything again. No number for customer service/tech support provided in my packaging. Returning it. Don't waste your time. Good reviews must have been purchased or perhaps for PCs?",7 people found this helpful

I usually always buy my drives as portable drives so I can pull them out of the enclosure at a later date and use them internally. This one I did it right off the bat. It performed wonderfully up until just earlier. The drive started hanging occasionally. I went to try to de fragment it in hopes that it just needed to organize the drive. Nope stuck at 0% de fragmented for 2 hours. Tried using chkdsk. Hopefully later tonight I can salvage some data from it but I'm not optimistic. I will no longer be purchasing Seagate products as of now. I've had 5 dollar beat up used drives last years and this couldn't even last a month... how pathetic. Plus now I cant even get a refund for it because its out of its enclosure.,

It specifically states it is for Mc/PC but it is not...you have to BUY AN UPGRADE or go through a complicated reformatting process. And the fine print of their BS policies state if you reformat drive you voice warranty and you void your one year rescue protection. I am getting a little sick of Amazon not enforcing truth in advertising. You shouldn't have to wait until you get the product to find out it was all a slick lie. And reformatting for Mac/PC should not be complicated but the BS this is spouting makes it complicated. So I either reformat and lose my protections or return it. Leaning towards returning it right now because I am so disgusted.,

Not USB 3.0,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on June 8, 2020",,True,"Received drive in plastic packaging in cardboard box, as other customer images show. Appears to have been repackaged - I bought the same 2TB Seagate drive some time ago and it came in proper packaging. Appearance of enclosure itself looks and feels cheaper. Don't know if things have changed, but the cheaper appearance makes me worry about how drive will hold up.The real kicker is that I bought this for my PS4, but when I tried hooking it up it wasn't compatible. PS4 requires an external drive to be connected, between 250GB-8TB, and be USB 3.0. Only thing I can think of is it that the included cord was not USB 3.0 as advertised. I tried a different cord, and it worked, but I'm extremely disappointed that the included cord was not 3.0 compatible, and I would have been more disappointed had I not had a different cord to use, and wouldn't have been able to use the drive at all.I am usually forgiving but when I order something I expect the advertised product, which I feel this failed to deliver.",

If you use this HDD with Linux and rsync, I would suggest you reformat it first, as soon as it arrives.",

After putting all of my important files onto it, and having had it for about 3 weeks, the drive has stopped working. My best guess is that it was somehow damaged in the computer case because the casing for the drive is made of thin, cheap plastic which is prone to being squeezed. Bottom line - the construction lead to the damage and loss of function. Now I have no files. I would not recommend this product, though I would say I expected more from Seagate.
