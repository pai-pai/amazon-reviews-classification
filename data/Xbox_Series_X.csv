Xbox Series X,4.0,The Ultimate Gaming Machine,"Reviewed in the United States on April 4, 2023",Style: Series X | Pattern Name: Xbox,True,"Are you ready for a gaming experience unlike any other? The Xbox Series X is here, and it's ready to take your gaming to the next level. As a long-time gamer and self-proclaimed tech enthusiast, I was eager to get my hands on the latest and greatest console from Microsoft. And let me tell you, it did not disappoint.First, let's talk about the design. The Xbox Series X is a sleek and sophisticated console that looks like it came straight from the future. Its monolithic form factor is not only aesthetically pleasing but also serves a purpose: it's designed for optimal cooling and airflow to ensure that the console can run at peak performance without any overheating issues. And boy, does it deliver. I've been playing games on this console for hours on end, and I've yet to experience any lag or slowdowns.The controller is also a thing of beauty. It's comfortable to hold, responsive, and features a new ""share"" button that allows you to capture and share screenshots and videos of your gameplay with ease. The haptic feedback and adaptive triggers provide a new level of immersion that truly enhances the gaming experience.But what really sets the Xbox Series X apart is its power. With a custom-designed processor, the console delivers up to 4K resolution and 120 frames per second, which means you'll get buttery smooth graphics and lightning-fast load times. And if you have a TV that supports it, you can take advantage of the console's 8K capabilities for an even more jaw-dropping visual experience.Of course, all of this power and performance comes at a cost, and the Xbox Series X is no exception. It's not cheap, and it may not be the right choice for casual gamers who are content with their current console. But for those who are serious about gaming and want the best of the best, the Xbox Series X is a no-brainer.In conclusion, the Xbox Series X is a true powerhouse of a console that delivers on every front. Its sleek design, powerful performance, and immersive features make it the perfect choice for any gaming aficionado. If you're in the market for a new console, the Xbox Series X should be at the top of your list. Highly recommended!",7 people found this helpful
Xbox Series X,4.0,A+ box presentation!,"Reviewed in the United States on November 13, 2020",Style: Series X | Pattern Name: Xbox,True,"So, yeah, new generation of hardware from Microsoft but can I talk about that box?  Because that was a spectacular way to jump into the next Xbox.You open the box up and there is the Series X all wrapped up like it's in a treasure chest.  It was great!  I actually had to take some video of it because it was above and beyond what I expected from unboxing a new console.  So good job on that!I'm upgrading from an Xbox One S and from that perspective, it was definitely time to upgrade.  I've got this 4K TV without a system that properly utilizes it!  I held off on getting a One X because I knew the next Xbox system would be coming out soon enough.And here it is.Visually speaking, I'm not really noticing TOO much difference from games on the One S.  There are some added details on some of my old games to upgrade them to 4K and I notice some effects that weren't there before.  Everything is less fuzzy.  So that's good.  It's just not the same as the visual jump from the NES to the SNES.  Or the Playstation to the Playstation 2.  But it IS close to the leap from the Xbox 360 to the Xbox One.  The difference there was only noticeable a few years after the fact for me.  I imagine the same will be true here, especially since most of the games I'm playing right not are Xbox One games upgraded to 4K and not native Series X games, beyond Yakuza: Like a Dragon.And that details the biggest drawback to getting a Series X at launch: lack of a strong exclusive library of games.  While the Playstation 5 has Spider-Man: Miles Morales, Godfall, and Sackboy, there isn't anything on the Xbox that can't be played on the PS5 except Yakuza: Like a Dragon (and that can probably be played as a PlayStation 4 game through backwards compatibility).  With Halo Infinite being delayed, there's no massive reason to upgrade your hardware.Well... I SAY that but I also don't regret doing so.  I'm disappointed in the lack of exclusives but the 4K is still very nice.  And it isn't even the best part of the Series X.  That would be the load times.  With the new hardware and the new memory storage system, games load incredibly fast.  I used to start a game up and then head into the kitchen to grab a drink or whatever while the console booted things up but those days are done.  This thing zips along.  That also applies while you're in the game.  Reloads and fast travels, even cut-scenes, happen swiftly.  There's a lot of power in this rectangular box.  The Playstation 5 also has super fast load times so it's not a selling feature if you're comparing consoles but, on its own, it presents a compelling case.It's a lot of the ""under-the-hood"" features that build this system up as a good replacement for your Xbox One.  The fact that it is capable of playing a large number of Xbox's back catalog going all the way back to the original Xbox means you'll have a huge library of games to play even if they aren't brand new exclusives.  I've got a serious backlog of titles so playing them in 4K and getting into my games faster is fine for me right now.  If you are a Gamepass subscriber, you have a large library of games to choose from right out of the gate, including a lot of EA games added from their EA Play subscription service.  I spent my first day just downloading everything I'm going to be wasting my time on over the next few months.And, let me be clear: if you play on Xbox, do yourself a favor and subscribe to Gamepass.  You get some great games and many of them are upgraded to take advantage of the Series X.  It's a good deal.I'm happy with my purchase.  I wish Halo would have made launch.  I'm also happy they held it back so that when it releases, it's worth playing.  But, man, launch would have made this purchase a lot more palatable.  In the end, it comes down to where your friends are.  Mine are on Xbox so here I am.  This thing is a powerhouse and I doubt I'm going to regret having it a year or so down the line.But if you have to make a choice between this and the Playstation 5 and you don't really do online gaming with your friends, the Playstation 5 makes a more compelling case this holiday season.  Miles Morales looks really good.But if Sony's exclusives don't move you, the third party games are all multiplatform.  You can enjoy your Call of Dutys and your Assassin's Creeds on whatever console you manage to get.  In 2020, I think we could all use a win and I think there's enough to keep you busy on both consoles to check that win box.Oh! This thing also has a controller!  It is pretty much exactly like the Xbox One controller which was a slight upgrade from the 360 controller... which was an upgrade from the Xbox S controller.  This is my favorite controller layout and it feels as comfortable in my hands as the XB1 version.  There's a capture button now to take pictures and video which is something Sony added with the PlayStation 4 and Nintendo added on the Switch.  So Microsoft is a little behind but it's here now!  I have not used it yet but I'm sure I'll get around to it.Anyway, welcome to the next generation of video game hardware.  This thing is a beast of tech and should prove a worthwhile purchase. In time.  Day one, you know what you're getting: an I.O.U. note promising better things to come.But, man, that treasure box opening is pretty great. ;)",64 people found this helpful
Xbox Series X,5.0,This review isn't going to help you off a fence.,"Reviewed in the United States on February 23, 2023",Style: Series X | Pattern Name: Xbox,True,"Look, you are either going to buy an Xbox or not. It isn't a random feeling someone gets like when walking down the candy section. It's and upgraded xbox one, just like that was an upgraded Xbox 360, just like that was an upgraded Xbox. No difference than how Sony made the playstation, PS2, PS3, PS4, and PS5.Now I will say, opening this up and turning it on WILL NOT feel like it did when you opened any of the following: NES, SNES, N64, GAMECUBE (defiantly won't feel like that), OG Xbox, or the PS2. They hit different but equally, except the GameCube that thing was just a touch better. If you were lucky enough to turn these on back in the day then this Xbox will be like turning the microwave on to heat up pizza rolls. The sound of it starting and humming doesn't fill you with the antici............................pation like other systems have.Now I'm not saying that the Xbox is dull or not worth it, the ps3-5 are just as blah. None of the systems lately have had that startup experience like the ones I mentioned. Yeah for me the NES was something new to the world and it was because I was so young that it impacted me like it did but the SNES was pretty special. the N64 held its head above water just, but the GameCube was something entirely different with the PS2 right there on its heels. The og Xbox was about like the N64, it wasn't bad but it didn't get to you like other systems did.Yes I'm old, my nes has been with me since I was 5 and I didn't limit myself to a brand. I still have my Sega master system and other Nintendo/Sega systems along with every Xbox and PS system. I've even got a Panasonic 3do..... but anyway.Like I said, this review won't get you down off the fence. Only advice I have is if you want it and have the money then get it but don't be one of these fanboys that is diehard Xbox cause one day you'll hate yourself for it.",41 people found this helpful
Xbox Series X,5.0,5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on April 4, 2023",Style: Series X | Pattern Name: Xbox,True,"I’ve had PlayStation my whole life, my brother had an Xbox. I never saw the appeal, I was heavily biased on the PlayStation. I started reading reviews and researching the difference between Xbox X and PS5. I really like the internal 1TB of the Xbox. The design is simple, sleek and looks good in the house. The controllers feel much better than the old ones. The user interface is easy to use and fun to play around with. All in all, I highly recommend the Xbox X even after an entire life of PlayStation. I hope this helps you, happy gaming.",3 people found this helpful
Xbox Series X,5.0,"Xbox SeriesX =  amazing console, absolute BEAST and best value in gaming. Playstation convert.","Reviewed in the United States on March 6, 2021",Style: Series X | Pattern Name: Xbox,True,"I have been a gammer all my life, have owned almost every console since the Atari Pong all the way till the Ps4 and Switch, but I have skipped most Xbox' s except for the original that was given to me as a gift.This new console that Microsoft has made is in my opinion the absolute best in this generation. Spec-wise it cannot be beat and if superior to the PS5 I most respects. But when you use your series X and in conjunction with Game Pass Ultimate (GPU), it simply becomes the hands down, no questions asked, absolute BEST VALUE in gaming anywhere! Today Microsoft has also teamed up their GPU service with EA, and now we can get most sports games and most EA titles included in GPU. But you must also add the future inclusion of Bethesda and all their amazing titles from day one in GUP since MS has bought them out.So how can't  you go wrong with the MOST POWERFUL CONSOLE EVER MADE and the potential of including GPU to make it the best value in gaming PERIOD.Yes some will think that their are few titles specifically made for this new generation as of this writing, but the same goes for Playstation, and Sony changed their mind in the short term, as most titles that they have as great exclusives are also being released for the foreseeable future on PS4 as well as PS5.PROS:- Best Value in gaming when used with Game Pass Ultimate.- Most powerful console ever made (12TFLOPS - 52 CU's).- Intuitive and very functional OS.- Great games even for this generation like: Medium.- FPS Boos feature for older games.- Automatic HDR for older games.- Instant Resume feature is just awesome!- Great controls, I thought I would not like them, BUT THEY ARE GREAT!- Minimalistic design, that goes well with anything you have already.- QUIET there is no noticeable sound of fans even when gaming for hours.- More available space in internal drive then PS5.CONS:- Controllers use a AA Battery... WHY would you do this in 2021? Yes there are options, but I should not need to look for options, personally for now I went the rechargeable Energizer route, but it is a hassle that should not be present in a console this generation.- No gimmicks and straightforward pure power, no you don't get resistance in the adaptive triggers like a PS5, makes it feel a bit less futuristic.- Had a bug happen to me more then once while purchasing new games, got an error, so for workaround had to add to cart, go to billing address, put edit, select the same billing address and then it worked, very annoying.SPECS:- Processor: 8-core AMD Ryzen Zen 2-architecture CPU at 3.8GHz (3.6GHz with SMT)- Graphics: AMD Navi/RDNA 2-family GPU with 52 CU at 1.825GHz (12TFLOPS FP32)- Video:16GB GDDR6 with 14Gbps 320-bit interface (10GB at 560GB/s allocated to GPU, 6GB at 336GB/s allocated to rest of system with 3.5GB for GPU)- Die Size: 360.45 mm2- Process: 7nm Enhanced- Memory: 16 GB GDDR6 w/ 320mb bus- Memory Bandwidth: 10 GB @ 560 GB/s, 6GB @ 336 GB/s- Internal Storage: 1 TB Custom NVME SSD- I/O Throughput: 2.4 GB/s (Raw), 4.8 GB/s (Compressed, with custom hardware decompression block)- Expandable Storage: 1 TB Expansion Card - Seagate ATM only avail.- External Storage: USB 3.2 External HDD - WB Black Gaming 5TB what I got for it.- Optical Drive: 4K UHD Blu-Ray Drive-- Performance: 4K @ 60 FPS, up to 4K @ 120 FPS, 8K @ 60 FPS- Size: 301mm x 151mm x 151mmFinally, I will recommend  this console over the the PS5, its simply a BEAST and a better value when teamed with GPU. I won't get a Ps5 for the foreseeable future at least not till late 2022, since by then they might really have PS5 exclusives that don't get. a PS4 version.The Xbox Series X is such a great console that you would be hard pressed to look it over over the hype that the Ps5 has generated because of its lack of availability. So if you like simply the best console this generation and wish to get the best bang for your buck, Xbox Series X simply rocks.PRO+ : The Xbox series X is also an amazing emulation system, it can run Retroarch with no hacks, with nothing weird, just look it up in YouTube and you will find tutorials. But it can do emulation like very few systems and it add to its tremendous lineup and value.Great job Microsoft, you not only added a customer, but a new fan.",73 people found this helpful
Xbox Series X,5.0,From someone who owned a PS4 and Xbox One,"Reviewed in the United States on September 22, 2021",Style: Series X | Pattern Name: Xbox,True,"I started out on the OG Xbox when I was 5 years old cause my dad bought it, he then bought the 360 and I loved that. When PS4 came out however I bought that cause the og Xbone was trash. After a 4 years or so however I had a spat with Sony customer support which if you have dealt with them ever it's awful. Pre-ordered a bunch of games, but then decided to stop gaming  in college (stupid decision), they wouldn't let me cancel despite then being pre-orders cause they're policy is trash. I disputed it, they banned account, I created a new one later on my roommate's PS5. Really liked horizon forbidden west not gonna lie. Nothing was actually seriously wrong with the PS4 itself, just Sony was. Xbox one x came out and I just had to buy it. My dad had the og Xbox one, and my word the continual updates to Xbox UI showed, it was fantastic. Then the game pass came out, if you are a playstation camper, let me just say this thing is actually amazing. I'd been falling out of love with gaming honestly, all the AAA games coming out had sucked recently. It felt that I couldn't have fun without spending a lot of money. One of the first games I played on the game pass was Control. Holy crap I missed out on this when it launched, and  I never would have discovered it if not for gamepass. I've discovered over 20+ games I never would have bought at full price and am loving it, it made me like gaming again truly.  When PS4 and XSX we're announced it felt like PS5 was the Xbox one at launch all over again. Trying take as much money as possible, and not being consumer friendly. Xbox smart delivery (no rebuying games) compared to Sony's pay $10-$20 for upgrade or buy the PS5 version for $60-70 all over again. Like come on, that's BS. All my saves are saved in cloud, I set up my XSX in 10 min, 7 of those was because it was updating. Only thing I had to do was download my games. Yeah launch titles sucked, but Xbox bought Bethesda so that doesnt matter anymore. All first party games are on the game pass day 1. I have not bought a single game since I bought control's XSX version (I could still play Xbox one version on game pass but I wanted to give Ray tracing a go, I had not purchased the Xbox one version though I should note, so this was my first time buying at a gp discount no less). It's fantastic, I'm getting equal or better value than PC (since new games are released on it as well). Everything is just so easy and simple on Xbox compared to PS5. It's like IOS vs the early days of Android (which I now own). Having experienced PS and Xbox, Xbox just has a much more stream lined experience. Also Xbox live crashes like maybe 1/6th (honestly maybe less) of the amount of PSN, like good lord that was actually the most annoying thing ever. The PS5 itself just seems outdated, and Sony seems hostile to the consumer.  Honestly this is hands down the best console I have ever owned except maybe the 360 because that was gaming's last golden age imo with COD, halo, GOW, mass effect, too many to name. Overall a just superior product, I do hate Sony after my spat, I fully admit that, but objectively this console is just better. I see nothing but frustration on the PS5. I will miss Horizon, but that's it. So unless you absolutely need God of war or something, like what Halo is (was) to me, buy this. Hell buy this over a PC, I was debating it, but this year and probably next year as well is just bad for getting or building a gaming PC. Seriously buy this console if you are on the fence, if you are debating at all, buy this console. It's xbox's generation this time around, for value, ease of use, as a finished product, and #1...for games and gamers. I debated for weeks which console to buy last generation, but it was simple this time around and I have zero regrets. In the end for the same amount of money you will be able play 2-3x the game you would on PS5, you can play 360 and OG Xbox games as well, for free if you own them already. If you own a gaming PC though, you don't need it.",114 people found this helpful
Xbox Series X,5.0,Great game console,"Reviewed in the United States on February 6, 2023",Style: Series X | Pattern Name: Xbox,True,"I bought this to replace my 10 year old first generation Xbox One, and the difference in speed and frame rate are immediately noticeable. Loading times from my T7 SSD take seconds to finish versus the old console.Plus, there’s no bizarre loading latency during gameplay:For example, freezing cutscenes with out of sync audio, & occasional pauses for the old console to load more of the game off the SSD.The Series X with newer hardware & USB Super Speed 3.1 fixed these problems.My one issue with this new Xbox is that they did away with the HDMI-in port that allowed me to watch cable/satellite TV through the console. Not a problem with the console in regards to what it has to offer, but more of a loss of convenience.Some final notes I feel worth mentioning:•When it came to connecting up the console, it’s a breeze.• There are fewer USB ports versus the old console.•When you power up the console for the first time, you are required to get the Xbox App for IOS/Android and have an internet connection to start the process of getting the console running.•Games made specifically for the Series X/S must be installed in the internal storage to run. Xbox One games run fine on a decent SSD, like my T7.•On a final note, despite the rectangular box shape, it’s surprisingly small, quite light in weight, and very quiet.Overall it is a great game console and it delivers exactly what it promises.",23 people found this helpful
Xbox Series X,5.0,Happy grandkids!,"Reviewed in the United States on April 11, 2023",Style: Series X | Pattern Name: Xbox,True,This was very difficult to find. Thanks to Amazon’s “waitlist” I was able to get one within a couple of weeks of requesting to purchase. My grandkids are thrilled - they say the graphics are amazing.,
Xbox Series X,5.0,Next-Gen Done and Begun Right,"Reviewed in the United States on November 28, 2020",Style: Series X | Pattern Name: Xbox,True,"Back in 2013, both Microsoft and Sony launched the Xbox One and PlayStation 4 (respectively). Compared to the generation prior (Xbox 360 and PS3) and how those compared to current PC's of the day, the seventh console generation did not start well. From false promises from Mark Cerny about the PS4 hitting 1080p and 60FPS for every game, to Microsoft's loss of focus on gaming... couple that with the less than impressive comparison to PC's, and you would find the apology for sale a few years later with the PS4 Pro and Xbox One X. Those were what we should have gotten to kick of a generation.Now here we are in 2020. The only downside has been acquiring one of the consoles and the lack of supply due to COVID-19. The Xbox Series X (seriously, Microsoft needs to do something about the naming) is a great offering with great value tucked away inside of the Xbox service.Without getting deep into the technical specs, I will highlight some key differences between the Series X and the One X. The SSD is first. Fast load times across the board for games and the system itself. The 1TB is not what you get in full, but it is not an issue if you keep a small catalogue of installed games. Currently with 6 games installed (AC: Valhalla, Destiny 2 ((all expansions)), GTA V, Red Dead Redemption 2 and Watch Dogs Legion), i am sitting at 357.5GB of free space. The frame rates are great with the ability to keep a steady 60FPS and achieve up to 120FPS. 4K is glorious with HDR. The Ray Tracing that some games have is a really nice touch, but unless you stop to smell the roses (or in this case the, wander up and stare at them), it doesn't jump out at you.Otherwise the console is impressive. Not a single sound has come from the machine in my few hours (extended this evening) of play time. The start up speed is incredibly fast and this is both from a fresh boot, to the low-power mode, to the unplugging method. Quick Resume is something to appreciate as well. Being able to have a handful of games running at once is a nice feature especially if you are one who has game ADD, or want to hop back into a single-player game after having a multiplayer session with friends.The new controller is built on the old saying, ""If it ain't broke, don't fix it."" While Sony went with a new design and functionality for the PS5 with the DuelSense controller (seriously the haptic feedback is a cool addition, but I have a weird feeling it will fade out at some point), I can't help but feel Microsoft kinda missed a chance with the Series X controller, by not adding a similar feature. However, the controller feels lighter than the last, that could be due to the fact I am using batteries instead of a play and charge kit. It feels also, slightly slimmer all around, but the shape is still ergonomically pleasing for any hand to hold. I don't mind the absence of an internal battery pack. I find that the play and charge is a nice option, and that with batteries you never have to worry about being plugged in. The jump to USB type C is nice as well, as most of the devices I own use that port exclusively. Added on to the controller's body is a texture around the back of the hand grips and the tops of the triggers. My grip feels more stable and connected. Also, the addition of a share button is nice for two reasons. First it is a great way to capture what you want without sacrificing gameplay or being vulnerable in a multiplayer title. And 2, it allows for screenshots to now be captured that when being taken by hitting the Guide button, would sometimes cause elements to disappear.As for the value tucked away that I mentioned, that comes thanks to Game Pass. A service I was not fully sold on when it was announced, but as time went on, I became interested and am now a member. And now with them (Microsoft) partnering with EA to bring EA Access to game pass, it makes me wonder what the future holds.",8 people found this helpful

Xbox Series X,4.0,"New look, New hardware, same old feel","Reviewed in the United States on January 27, 2023",Style: Series X | Pattern Name: Xbox,True,"I must say I'm always questioning my purchase of this console. The hardware is different but the software and UI make me feel like I got a reskinned Xbox One. Performance... well, I can't really see much difference. It seems perhaps mere seconds faster than the last generation. I'm still on 1080p at 60hz though so I guess I won't be seeing much graphical change. But all the hype about terraflops and this and that, I expected much much more as a casual gamer. For the most part I feel like I took my car to the detailer and drove away in a 'new car.'There's not many X/S games out right now that scale up to what this device was built for either ... so I'd encourage people to save their money and wait until that time comes (but I totally get it, since the shortages).One major issue I'm already coming across is storage. Some of my favorite games are 100+GB (Ark was 151+Dlc)... so my 1TB (800GB drive) can't really store that much. And since your X/S game has to be native to play ... I'm really concerned....especially seeing how MS wants to charge half a console for its upgraded solution.",13 people found this helpful
Xbox Series X,5.0,Next-Gen Gaming!,"Reviewed in the United States on December 18, 2022",Style: Series X | Pattern Name: Xbox,True,"This console is an absolute beast! I finally managed to get my hands on it through Amazon’s invite after 2 years of the chip shortage and scalping issues. It arrived a couple days later as scheduled, no problems. Set up was simple and was kinda surprised by the weight of the console. It’s a THICC BOI for sure. The login process took less than 10 min, quick and easy. Installed  games then instantly felt the difference. Loading times is literally insane, first time experiencing an SSD as fast as this. Unfortunately, I have a ton of big titles so the 1 TB of storage filled up shortly after. I later decided to get the Seagate expansion card which was $20 off on sale. The card is a great accessory to complement the console, I use it to store the Optimized Series X games and then a 4 TB hard drive for the older games. I also really enjoy the controller, it feels really good in the hands. Playing Overwatch 2 and MW2 at 120 FPS on my 4K HDR TV was an absolute experience! Game-pass is also great to add to the experience, great value with a large library of games with diverse genres. Overall, the console is great! Playing games has never been better for a competitive gamer like me. Sometimes I feel like I’m cheating with how powerful this thing is for only $500. However, I do wish there were more exclusives for the Series X but I feel like this console will get better as time goes on. Microsoft and the Xbox team outdid themselves in delivering such a beast of a console for this next generation. Whichever side of the console war you’re on, at the end of the day it’s a preference. I really feel like that not one side of the fandom will regret in getting any of these new consoles (Series X/PS5).",31 people found this helpful

Xbox Series X,5.0,I stand corrected,"Reviewed in the United States on December 22, 2022",Style: Series X | Pattern Name: Xbox,True,"Ok, I’m man enough to admit when I was mistaken.  I originally had some problems and left a not so great review and I’m now editing my review.  Turns out, nothing was wrong with my new Xbox X,  my Vizio (so called 4k, aka garbage)TV couldn’t handle the responsibility.Since I upgraded to a real TV, life is good and I took a sledge hammer to that useless Vizio thing (that was super fun).The gaming is visually stunning on the series x.  The real test was this weekend, I had the chance to side by side the PS5, same game and all and it was no contest, the series x is so insanely better, it’s not even close.  From the controllers, to speed, to graphics, and load times,  it’s not even close.The only advice I have is dont try to hook this up to a budget TV, it can’t take it, it will cause all kinds of video input issues.  It’s like trying to take a high end Mercedes off road.  Just ain’t gonna turn out good.A lot of people say the ps5 and series x are close in performance, I don’t see it, not visually, not in speed, an most definitely not with the U.I, It’s like the saying Sega Dreamcast was on par with N64.

The load times are so much faster and the graphics are stunning. The detail and shading and light that some of the games can now offer on this system are amazing. The setup was easy, the controller is comfortable with the added texture on the grips, the potential game library is vast thanks to backwards compatibility, and the ability to play 4K Blu-ray is an added bonus. The only complaint that comes to mind is the amount of storage space for games.

The graphics are stunning and the load times are almost nonexistent thanks to the solid state drive. The controller is comfortable to hold and the haptic feedback adds a new level of immersion to my gameplay.One of the standout features of the Xbox Series X is the backwards compatibility. I was able to easily import all of my old Xbox One games and play them with improved graphics and performance. The ability to play my favorite old games with the improved hardware is a major plus.The Game Pass subscription is also a great value, providing access to a vast library of games that I can download and play at no additional cost. The online multiplayer experience is smooth and lag-free.Overall, I am extremely satisfied with my purchase of the Xbox Series X and would highly recommend it to any gamer looking for the ultimate gaming experience.

Xbox Series X,5.0,Fantastic Evolution of the Xbox Ecosystem,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on March 3, 2021",Style: Series X | Pattern Name: Xbox,True,"This is a fantastic console, runs great and is whisper quiet. I wouldn't be the first to admit there aren't a ton of games that fully leverage the Series X's horsepower at launch, but I'm sure that'll improve over time, just as it will for the PS5.Availability is a serious problem, and Amazon is not helping by selling to scalpers and allowing scalpers to resell consoles on their platform at insane markups.Pros-- 4K120 support. Not many games leverage this yet, but games that do look outstanding.- SSD - Any games placed on the internal SSD load at PC (or very close to PC) speeds, which is incredible. Once the SSD is full, games can be stored (but not ran) from external storage. Transfers usually don't take long between external drives and the SSD, but your mileage may vary depending on the kind of external drive you have.- Compatibility - The Series X is fully backwards compatible with any Xbox one game (besides Kinect), and works with a pretty large selection of Xbox 360 and original Xbox games. Just about any accessory that worked with Xbox One will also work with Series X, no need to buy all new headsets, controllers, or much of anything.- Looks/Aesthetic - The Series X blends in super well into an entertainment center. Mine sits right at the center of the entertainment center and doesn't look all too different from something like a home theater receiver- Temps/Noise - The series X runs super quiet and has no issues with thermals. The only suggestion that I would have is don't put it in an enclosed cabinet. It intakes through the bottom of the backside of the console and outputs heat through the top, so that needs to have at least a few inches of clearance and space to intake ambient air. My entertainment center has an open front and back, and the Series X has no issues in there.Cons-- Availability - this is a little bit Microsoft, a little bit Amazon and a lot of bit scalpers (""resellers""). Please don't buy this console for more than the $499 MSRP, it encourages scalpers to snap up more supply just so they can make a buck. Supply will catch up, but it's going to take time especially given the state of the supply chain right now.- Wireless Headsets/Accessories - I'm absolutely flabbergasted that Microsoft STILL hasn't figured out how to enable any USB/wireless headset to just WORK when plugged into the series X, or allow for bluetooth pairing with the console. Instead, Xbox still relies on a proprietary wireless standard or the ridiculous port on their controller for the use of any headset that isn't a generic 3.5mm one. PlayStation and PC BOTH support this easily, plug-and-play and have for years. There's no excuse at this point.",5 people found this helpful

Xbox Series X,5.0,"Fast, quiet, powerful! What more can you ask for? Better design maybe. Best console ever made?","Reviewed in the United States on November 14, 2020",Style: Series X | Pattern Name: Xbox,True,"Excellent is the best word to describe this xbox series x. I been a gamer since the 1980s and this is by far the best console ever created. Lets take a look at some pros and cons and also why I think its better then ps5.ProsIts fast! When I say fast I really mean FAST. Loads games in 5 seconds flat, menu system is snappy etc.It's powerful! The few games available to try right now that are optimized for the series x look very good and you can tell the future will bring alot of good high end graphics to consoles finally!Great selection of games thru game pass. And its backwards compatible with all Xbox games from previous consoles.ConsSo far there's only 2.1. I think they could of did better with the controller.  Although I still believe xbox controller is better then the competition in layout and thumb sticks etc. the plastic just feels cheap. The better grip and dpad is nice but the overall feel is cheap. Theres a small lip at the top that gives it a unfinished feeling. Also no rechargeable battery is a bummer as well.. Ps5 controller just looks way better and more of a future look to it.2. The system is bulky and looks like a fridge or just a big black box. The insides alot of work went into to develop a closed system with good cooling and a monster fan which is quiet and I appreciate that but the design is not good.Ps5 design is definitely better.Now why do I feel the series x is better then ps5. It all comes down to a few things.1. It's a bit more powerful2. Better online game library with gamepass.3. Better mobile play options with being able to play straight on your mobile phone or laptop or pc gives the xbox an advantage.If you always been a Playstation guy and all your friends are on there I can see sticking with ps5. But if you don't care about friends and want a bit better experience with ability to play your games even on the go then xbox is the moveI know this is a long review but I feel microsoft deserved it since they did a hell of a job with this system and I highly recommend it to anyone.If your a gamer and thinking of switching from pc to a new console then this would be the one I recommend.",3 people found this helpful
Xbox Series X,3.0,Xbox it's time to step up compatibility and versatility.,"Reviewed in the United States on January 3, 2023",Style: Series X | Pattern Name: Xbox,True,"I love Xbox X but the memory is totally disappointing. I don't want to spend $200 -$400 to install the games I frequently play on an expansion cards sold only by one supplier. You can only play XS games on internal or the Seagate card. As more of the games on my external hard drive update to XS they become useless as I have no room on the internal hard drive.  PS5 allows you to pick your own compatible ssd drive from various suppliers making them affordable. PS5 also allows you to pick ps5 or ps4 versions of the game allowing compatibility with what ever hard drive you have. Xbox forces you to update your game to XS if you are using the XS....thus making your game on external hard disk useless. Xbox please stop making dumb decisions and make the system as compatible and versatile as possible. With halo dead and gears of War dying Xbox needs to step things up. I left PS because the network WAS terrible always down, matchmaking at the time WAS none existent, then they got hacked, ruining all online play for half a year and my credit card info was sold on the black market. I remember when Xbox gold games was A list games not F or D list games, and you owned them.  I have not forgotten, but if you don't tighten up I'll leave you too. But other than my personal rant and no choice but to by high price memory, the system works. Pushes 120 frames and 4k with games that allows the settings. Hate that they removed the hdmi one guide input, like in the Xbox one cause I used that as my cable box and gaming all in one.",3 people found this helpful
Xbox Series X,5.0,Great Console!,"Reviewed in the United States on August 22, 2022",Style: Series X | Pattern Name: Xbox,True,"I now own both the Series X and the PS5 so I will simply say this about the Series X. It is very well built and the design has silent fans and the console heat is channeled through the top making it efficient. What I like is it is not as big as the PS5. The controller feels great. Software design is really good and the system is fast! Smart delivery makes sure you have the best version of game automatically and Gamepass is awesome. What I do not like about it is that it basically feels like the Xbox One X on steroids. The UI is basically the same so it does not have that brand new console feel to it you get with new stuff. All the games have run phenominal. If I had to choose only one console I would pick this Series X over my PS5. The PS5 is HUGE and really ugly in person. Sticks out like a sore thumb, but it performs as well as the series x and better on some games I have noticed. The new controller with the PS5 is really good and with the new UI it really feels like a new console. Both systems are great and well worth the purchase.

This console was very easy to setup out of the box in comparison to the PS5 ( own both). Both consoles are great, I prefer the Xbox controller and like the new design and triggers PS5 controller is just a bit too heavy and I don't prefer the microphone on the controller built in. Xbox is my preferred console, however the PS5 offers a huge amount of free games since I've owned it and they are all very expensive games to buy for the Xbox (grateful I don't need to) Xbox makes up for this with there ""game pass"" but in my opinion the games are not good at all in comparison to what Playstation actually gives you not lets you ""rent"" also the low fee will increase so the people that have game pass will regret it in the long run. Overall happy with the purchase, love the new Halo I only play multi-player and it's actually free wow! I would get xbox live gold card on Amazon its $55 for a year best value, I would skip the game pass that is my opinion especially since I have PS5 free games a huge amount in the two years of ownership.

So when I bought the Series X, I could not believe it took less than 5 seconds for me to load up new saves or screens on my favorite game (skyrim); before it took several minutes. The description of a ""console that swallowed a lambo"" is perfect for this beast of a machine.Pros:1.) Extremely fast2.) Xbox Game Pass is a great service when paired with this3.) The disc option is ideal since it allows me to play old xbox one and 360 games.4.) Higher stock storage capacity than the PS55.) Design/Looks of the console may be simplistic but it fits well in any home-entertainment setup.Cons:1.) Lack of exclusives- Microsoft buying Bethesda and Activision-Blizzard makes up for the lack of notable third-party exclusives since launch in 2020; hopefully this will be fixed soon with the launch of Starfield, Elder Scrolls 6, and other notable upcoming titles.2.)

Thank you Amazon for doing it right, even if it did take a couple years to actually do it right.

I'm not going to lie, I have not bought a single game yet, and have just downloaded a bunch of games with Gamepass.The only thing that I really dislike about this device is the UI, and the fact that the Blu-ray software is not pre-installed.Now, with my PS4, PS5, and Xbox Series X all connected to my TV, I can load three different Blu-rays which is great if I am watching a series on Blu-ray (For example, my copy of Steins Gate that showed up a few days back)Great device so far.",3 people found this helpful

It is so fast when loading menus, games, basically everything! Gaming in 4K is good too! Forza Horizon 5 looks fantastic! I look forward to trying Halo Infinite! I'm well satisfied with the performance. The console is smaller than expected. It was easy to hook up and get started. I will buy an expansion card eventually. 1TB storage is kinda weak but they gotta keep costs down I guess... Still love that expansion option! I love the controller. Sticking with the tried and true but added a screenshot button. Which I will use! So pretty cool!Overall I'm very impressed and glad I upgraded. It was pretty easy to get too.

Xbox Series X,5.0,Xbox Series X Review,"Reviewed in the United States on November 10, 2020",Style: Series X | Pattern Name: Xbox,True,"To start off I would consider myself not a pro gamer, but definitely not a casual. I’m some where in between hardcore & Pro gamer. I got some insight on specs etc. This review will not be about the specs because we already know it’s damn better than last gen console Xbox One X.After a terrible, terrible, terrible...... the worst preorder experience of my life. I’m not joking. This generation of consoles preorders will go down in gaming history infamy because how bad it was, especially during our pandemic. I was as excited as I ever could be to receive this item as if I was a child all over again. And to top it all off it came 9 hours earlier on release day! I call that a significant win for preorder delivery, since this is my first time preordering a console online.Now for what your really here for, the console review. Personally, I love it. Load times are significantly faster! Games look so damn good! And total backwards compatibility with this console made me cry tears of joy. A true 4k experience. Something last generation promised us that didn’t happen.Now not anything is perfect. The one huge downside is there are no new games for this system yet. Usually there will be about 5 to 10 day one (some exclusive only to console) games. This year there’s basically 0. Yes, the positive spin on this is you have a while back catalog of older games you can play on this newer system and see the graphics ramped up. But as an avid gamer I am a Little disappointed that Microsoft the back big time even during pandemic that they couldn’t even offer at least 3 day one games. Sony is the same. These consoles will not have new games coming out day 1 unfortunately. We’ll have to wait till a little more in 2021 to expect the games we really want.If you want a more in-depth review you can head right on over to my YouTube channel where you can see an extensive review on the console today at 8pm central standard time. My dad and puppy will be on. It’l is going to be hilarious and cute. My channels name is Clive Childress. Come check it out of your interested to know more.All in all though this console is stellar. And I can’t fault the company for the pandemic situations. So with all that said this is a pretty great console.",107 people found this helpful

Xbox Series X,5.0,Top notch,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on May 27, 2022",Style: Series X | Pattern Name: Xbox,True,"This console is excellent.Even though this generation of consoles isn’t as exciting or revolutionary as certain console generations where huge jumps are made, it must be said that these consoles represent all that learned from the past with features perfected that we may take for granted. Examples include great ease of use, a streamlined easy to understand UI, quick responsive performance, excellent online gaming and community integration and media consumption options. New is the quick resume, a huge fan and intelligent design to prevent over heating, high performance 4k and hdr and game pass.Game pass is the next innovative feature microsoft is introducing just like they helped usher in the age of netflix on the 360, now they are making their own games collection membership and it works very well with a great lineup of games.The important stuff. Games run smoothly and at high resolutions, online works flawlessly, there is a very good library of current gen and back compatible games with sales going on all the time and at least in my opinion the controller is the best gaming controller available at this time, in terms of feel, ergonomics, looks, design and ease of use. Not to mention its PC compatible out of the boxConsole itself is beefy and in my opinion looks very niceI guess the only point against is a relative lack of exclusives but that shouldn’t deter you from it.",

Overall, I'm very happy with the Xbox I received. It's got amazing graphics and some awesome processing powers. I'm still frustrated that I can't use it with the games I wanted to play, but that's something I'll have to live with. I like playing on this console, but if there could be a way to link my accounts and transfer games over, that'd be appreciated.(Previous review) I'm livid. Literally bought my first TV for my apartment, 4K, and this new Xbox Series X so that I could play my favorite games on a couch in my living room. This is my first console, first TV, etc. I already own several games that I've paid for. Guess what, YOU CAN'T INSTALL THEM EVEN AFTER LINKING ACCOUNTS. That should be enough to tell your systems that I OWN THOSE GAMES ALREADY. But no, you'd rather I still pay $70 each because of capitalism.The majority of the games I wanted to play aren't included with the Game Pass either, so I don't suggest that.

Xbox Series X,4.0,Kinda buggy,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on November 29, 2022",Style: Series X | Pattern Name: Xbox,True,It works great most of the time and is a huge upgrade from the original Xbox one but sometimes you can’t access Microsoft store and games have refused to finish downloading even months after getting it. Definitely has room for improvement in the future.,
Xbox Series X,5.0,Huge Upgrade,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on May 10, 2022",Style: Series X | Pattern Name: Xbox,True,"Upgraded to this from my Xbox One X when Elden Ring came out, and the decreased load times and increased frame rate was a literal game changer. ER struggled to hit 30 fps on the OneX, but is super smooth (maybe not quite a solid 60), but it feels like a different game. Much faster to get back to the action after each inevitable death, too. Fast traveling to different graces is so fast, I don't even have time to check my phone.The multi-quick-resume function is also awesome, as I constantly have at least 3 or 4 games ""in progress"", and being able to jump quickly from one to another (especially for my kids) is super convenient.It's also MUCH quieter than the OneX, and I can't even hear the fan when I get into a resource-heavy game.The only downside is the form factor. It was easy to have my OneX and PS4 right beside each other on my current entertainment center, but I had to re-locate the PS4 and re-route the cables. I kinda knew that going into it, but didn't realize exactly how big/clunky the console itself is.Overall, hugely happy with the upgrade. There's just a bunch of quality-of-life improvements over the One X, but there'd be a massive improvement coming from a base One. So far, the ""Series X"" exclusive games haven't really wowed me, but the advantages of running Xbox One X games optimized for Series X is definitely worth it.",2 people found this helpful

I am a real human and gamer and actually play this console for it's intended purpose.Second, as a near daily gamer with over 400,000 gamerscore, who has been playing Xbox since 2007, this console definitely is the culminating event... thus far.

It vents heat well to maintain CPU peak efficiency.-Load screen time was cut by more than half. I usually load into a game before all my Co-op partners, even the host.-Lag is no longer a problem, unless it's internet related.-Set-up is extremely easy as the contents are only the console, 2 cords & a controller.The full price tag is currently well worth it for anyone who games regularly on Xbox.I checked online for a new Xbox Series X from several retailers 5x a week for a year and a half before Amazon came through. I simply ordered it and it arrived on my doorstep. Never left the house to claim a ticket or stand in line.Lastly, thank you Amazon for selling the stand-alone console and avoiding the greed of making it an $800 bundle of other junk we don't need.Gamertag: E vee dub",2 people found this helpful

Gameplay is absolutely phenomenal... gameplay loads SO MUCH FASTER than the Xbox one x and the picture quality is stunning...  the 2 downsides of this console is that, especially since I’m on spring break, I play for about 8 hours a day and it can get VERY hot and especially if you play like call of duty Warzone or black ops coldwar. sometimes it will just shut off by itself for how hot it can get and it would automatically close out your game sometimes if your console gets too hot midgame . Also, I was trying to buy this console for 2 weeks straight and it was literally the hardest thing ever and I was SO LUCKY to get it from Amazon...OVERALL, this console is absolutely amazing and I recommend it to everybody who wants to buy it but please don’t buy this from a scalper because it’s not worth it and you would be better off waiting and if your a scalper, your not a good person.",

Colours are brilliant. Games which exploit native 4k resolution and HDR really do look spectacular. Gameplay is immersive and very responsive. Controllers are very familiar to existing Xbox users, will take a bit of getting used to for those new to the platform. There are loads of games, and it is backwardly compatible with existing games. The optical drive is a real plus as it allows you to use it as a home entertainment system if you have TV and movie Bluray discs, DVDs and music CDs, just hook it up to a sound system.Something which is worth noting is that it is extremely quiet in use.The reason we went for this rather than the cheaper S is the optical drive, it is also a better performer with superior specifications, though I'm not sure how noticeable that is in reality. My only criticism is the form factor which is bulky and oddly shaped, I'd much prefer the more traditional form factor.Overall a worthy upgrade to the Xbox and the game console to buy in my opinion, 5*.",One person found this helpful

There's nothing really revolutionary especially if you're coming from the Xbox One X that had a powerful GPU already.Launch game list is atrocious, nothing really great to captivate the Xbox faithful. In the month and a half that I've had this console I've played Rocket League, Cyberpunk, Ori, GOW 5, Gears Tactics - they look nice but really can't see a difference compared to my One X graphically. Of course, there's the much better load times, instant game boot up and general quitness to the console which are a great improvement but is it worth $500 over the $500 I paid 2-3 years ago for the One X? Not really.Overall, I am an early adopter of tech, I've had all the day one editions since the 360 so I am a beta tester of sorts - I do anticipate the XSX to get better starting in 2021 with more first party games takind advantage of the the strong GPU and SSD performance. But for now, if you're a casual gamer like me or have the Xbox One X I would say to hold off until mid-late 2021. If you are rocking the Xbox One or Xbox One S then this is a worthy upgrade just for the visual upgrades and speed improvements.I play on a 65"" LG CX Oled TV via HDMI 2.1 cable, hopefully in 2021 more TVs are able to take advantage of all the tech the XSX offers for cheaper.",3 people found this helpful
Xbox Series X,5.0,Best New Gen Console Out There,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on April 14, 2022",Style: Series X | Pattern Name: Xbox,True,"As a PS5 & Xbox Series X owner, i barely use my PS5 anymore. The Xbox combined with gamepass keeps me busy all the time, so many games and honestly with now Microsoft in the process of buying the Call of Duty Developer I basically get on gamepass All the sport games plus Call of duty on a console that plays great and looks great. I honestly cant ask for more. Meanwhile PS5 raised the prices for games, still has no VRR  (Which helps a lot with making games run smoother) and still no Dolby atmos on games. Which, btw, they ditched Dolby Atmos to use their own version of Positional Audio because they dont want to pay for the license. I cant use Sony's proprietary sound on my Home Theater Receiver because no receiver uses that tech, so If you dont play on headphones you wont be able to enjoy positional audio like on Xbox. Honestly, I'm so disappointed with the PS5 and Im really happy I gave Xbox a chance, its the best console this gen.

Until it wasn't. c'est la vie,"Reviewed in the United States on November 12, 2020",Style: Series X | Pattern Name: Xbox,True,"I will start by stating I know the risks of being one of the first to get new tech.  So take my review with a grain of salt.  If you are reading this 6 months from now you probably are fine.  I am giving 4 stars because I feel the early release pains are more on the company and not the product.My review is that the Xbox delivers on what it said it would.  It is crazy powerful and just runs games beautifully.... For the short amount of time it did that.  There I was, in the middle of a 10 kill Warzone Trios making sick comms, about to secure another W all while saying ""If they only knew it was on the new Xbox"" then all of a sudden... bewp... Series X Series-ly shut down out of no where.  Not just a casual bye, no, like an angry significant other coming in and saying ""You're still playing that game?!?"" and slamming the door in your face.  I tried a number of things to get the Xbox to come back to me.  I sang it a song, tucked it in, promised I would buy every Microsoft exclusive game.  But alas nothing worked.  I now have a very, plain looking, desk weight.  Now I get to go through the fun and lengthy warranty return process with good ol big brother Microsoft.  I will take solace in the few short hours I got to brag and make fun of the ""one'ers"" who couldn't get their hands on one, but will likely have a working console before I get my replacement.

I was originally was going to get the Xbox One X in 2018 to replace my Xbox One Launch version but so glad I held off as the XSX is able to run older games nearly at the intended locked framerate with rarely any drops like the Xbox One X. I pulled out some of my old favorite Original Xbox, Xbox 360 and Xbox one games and they all look better with a more stable framerate, a higher resolution with higher amounts of AF.All in all the system is lighting fast. Usually, with load screens, I would pull out my phone or walk away to do something else. With this system, you really cannot do that anymore due to the lightning-fast SSD. The Xbox dashboard is very snappy like modern high-end smartphones. I am very glad I didn't get the Xbox1x and got this. The controller is similar to the Xbox One controllers but it has a textured backside. The triggers also feel more solid.Lastly, I'm not one to do game subscriptions but GamePass is very enticing at $15 per month. I'm planning to sign up by the end of the month.All in all, it's a good value if you have a 4K display. Coming from a Steam PC gamer Im very impressed with the system.",4 people found this helpful

I had and enjoyed xbox 360 but PS was my go to.  That all changed when I bought the xbox one x and tried gamepass. What a game changer that combo was for me quite literally. The one x played 3rd party games better than the competition and gamepass was an incredible value. Backward compatibility was the bonus. I loved it.Series X continues that power and value proposition without the mistakes xbox made with the xbox one launch. Microsoft and xbox have really turned it around and have once again produced the monolith of power with Series x.Fast ssd, super smooth menus, 1440p/4k support, variable refresh rate, auto low latency, hard drive support, backwards compatible with games and accessories, gamepass, games optimized for series x or s, familiar yet just better controller, external ssd expansion card available, auto hdr... you get the drift.The series X is best most complete xbox I dare say ever produced. If your already an xbox gamer its a no brainer to upgrade... if your thinking about making the switch... this is the best xbox to get onto to.Its familiar yet improved in every way.

Xbox Series X,5.0,This console is at the pinnacle of gaming!,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on July 18, 2021",Style: Series X | Pattern Name: Xbox,True,"This was a HUGE step for me in gaming and I just can't understand the amount of hate in these reviews. The fact of the matter is that the middle man of any product must profit, otherwise there is no middle man. Aside from the price though, this console is incredible. Its speed and performance has highly impacted my gaming and it shows. I play Call of Duty Warzone and I beat everyone to the map whether it is multiplayer or warzone and not to mention I no longer experience weird situations where I should have won a shootout with someone. For example: I have a friend whom I always 1v1 and I thought he was the best player in the game beating me 60-20. But when I got this console I started beating him suddenly. I NEVER THOUGHT I COULD BEAT HIM. Also the speed and quick resume is an absolute blast. I can download games at 3-400 Mbps now and I no longer have to wait 2-3 hours but only 15-20 minutes. The amount of room that this thing has is great and overall this console is a work of art in my opinion.",

Xbox Series X,1.0,Whatever happened to value for the money?  And no more nag upsell garbage?,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on November 11, 2022",Style: Series X | Pattern Name: Xbox,True,"Ok, so the first gaming system I ever bought new was an Atari 2600 - so I'm definitely dating myself.  Beyond that I didn't go in for the continual upgrades and updates and all the constant upsell.  I finally did break down and buy a Wii decades later and that was fun until they shut down the entire multiplayer network and basically bricked the things to sell new games.  Fast forward to 2022 and this fails at every level for delivering satisfaction and fun without the constant annoyance of money grubbing.  First of all, include 2 controllers.  It's multiplayer and you ought to make it so out of the box.  Having to go buy an additional controller just to play it new out of the box with the girlfriend was an absolute annoyance.  Second - RECHARGEABLE BATTERIES!!!!  OMF....F....G!!!!!  Include rechargeable batteries and stop destroying the environment.  This is a simple no brainer.  Include a charging pad of some sort or even USB cables and 2 rechargeable controllers.  2 days in and the batteries died.  I'm shocked in the quality and power management.  I can use my phone constantly for days on end now and a few hours play kills a set of new batteries at $3 per pair and instead I had to go spend extra on rechargeable.Biggest gripe - NONE OF THE FREE GAMES ARE FREE!!!!!  Most are demo, limited, locked down!  The advertising says hundreds of free games!  FALSE ADVERTISING!!!!!  YOU MUST PAY MORE TO UNLOCK THE REST OF THE GAME!!!!  What the heck kind of scam is this?  I'm seriously thinking about just returning the whole damn thing and saying screw it.  I mean there's 49 selections for Grand Theft Auto and you must constantly buy new feature packs and updates, or even worse you must subscribe?  Heck, when I was a kid, you bought an Atari console and it came with a couple games.  If you wanted an extra game, you went and bought it.  There were no maintenance fees, updates, add-on packs that you could buy to get an unfair advantage!!!  What has this crapola come to?The game play and controller is like every other latest tech.  Buzzwords and features galore, but it is all predicated on screwing you for more money at every step.  CONSTANT IN GAME UPSELL!!!  PLAY A NEW FEATURE!!!  BUT WAIT, IT'S $9.99 TO PLAY IT!!!!  At this point I am really disgusted and I'm not going to pay to make Microsoft richer.  I'm going to put this console where it belongs inside Gates.",18 people found this helpful

I played in awe the entire way through the game on the Series X. It’s a beautiful machine that performs well, and it has surpassed all of my expectations. Assassins Creed Valhalla was the game that really impressed me the most on performance mode. Any worries about no true next gen games went right out the window after playing this game. All games load super fast and it is fantastic. I’m used to loading a game, picking my phone, up and scrolling through social media, etc. With the Series X a game will load so fast that by the time I pick my phone up and open an app that I put it down right away, because I’m in the game already. Each game differs in loading time but boy this machine is fast. Quick Resume works well on older games, and another added bonus. The 4K player plays my movies and they look and sound beautiful as well. It’s also silent to my ears and it lives up to its hype.

Xbox Series X,5.0,A Superb Piece of Hardware,"Reviewed in the United States on August 26, 2021",Style: Series X | Pattern Name: Xbox,True,"The Xbox Series X overall is exceptionally neat console with tons of amazing cutting edge features, superb graphical specs (actually a bit superior to the PS5), Xbox Game Pass subscription offering true value for your money, controller every bit as great as the Xbox One controller, and a overall clean fast paced experience. Only downside to the Series X right now is a weak 1st/2nd party exclusive library at the moment, but it should obviously get better overtime for years to come.But other than that, the Xbox Series X as a console is a huge improvement over the Xbox One (which admittedly was indeed a disappointing console) and the current overall direction that Phil Spencer and Microsoft have for Xbox I hope they will stick with that strategy for many years to come. If you can find it at the right price (no more than the suggested $500 MSRP price), I truly recommend the Xbox Series X (or Series S if you don't care about 4K & wanna save some money).",2 people found this helpful

Eventually you may have to spill for the 1TB sea gate expansion card.

Variable refresh rate on certain TVs like LG and Panasonic. Microsoft is aware and will patch this via a software update. In the meantime, you can either turn VRR off on your Xbox video settings or run it at 1440p/1080p which works fine.Gamepass is the best value in gaming right now, Destiny 2 and the new expansion are on it.UI is running butter smooth and games are launching instantly.

With the Series X, I can play RDR2 without any noise from the console. Everything looks better too on this compare to the One X. Now there have been some hiccups here or there since launch but Microsoft have done a good job so for with trying to fix things. My major issue are the controller not syncing when the batteries die and having the restart the console to get it to sync, some games won't quick resume and that causes all the other game and apps not to launch, and games like Call of Duty Black Ops: Cold War crashing all the time. The first two are Microsoft's problems, while the last one is the devs. Overall, it's a good console and for most will be worth the upgrade.",One person found this helpful

Xbox Series X,1.0,Not really worth it,"Reviewed in the United States on March 11, 2023",Style: Series X | Pattern Name: Xbox,True,"I had to get three different xboxes before I got one that worked. The first one kept turning off my controller and turning off randomly. The second one had problems with the fan. It didn’t even matter if it was on or off the fan would speed up to ridiculous speeds, even when idling. And even though I got the third one that worked, I still fill it is not even worth it. I had an Xbox one the original one before this, thinking it would be so much better, but I was mostly disappointed. My games seem to crash more often, it seems slower sometimes taking more than five minutes to load my games and apps (if a game is on). I feel like I never had any of these problems that I have had on this Xbox compared to the first one. Also, as soon as I got it and tried to start playing Xbox again, Microsoft banned my main account, saying that I manipulated their services even though I don’t even know what they were talking about; The customer service sucks not being able to get any help with anything. The only upside to this product, making me think he deserves a star is that it has 4K and HDR capabilities. But instead of spending $500 on this console and countless dollars on their subscriptions just get a computer and steam it will complicate your life much less.",

I have mostly played PS4 and PC  in the past few years. I was very intrigued with Xbox series X because of the user experience. They really seem like they were listening with this generation and it shows. The UI interface is like butter it moves so quickly, with hardly any waiting. Game pass which is an amazing option only on Xbox and PC has an amazing selection of games right at my fingertips for a monthly fee. Xbox really got the user experience down I can honestly say that it was definitely worth it. I've been enjoying a lot of games that I played on PC and I am confident in saying that I have such a great experience on Xbox series X I'm blown away. It gets a little hot but I have it in a very breathable location. ( I would recommend that as well ) I'm excited to play all the Xbox one games I missed out on!

Apps start up so much faster than the old generation. If you don’t play too many games that are Series X|S enhanced I recommend you get a hard drive. The games won’t start up as fast but it won’t take up ssd storage for games that are optimized. I play quite a few games ranging from FPS to Racing. And I’ve noticed the console gets warmer on Forza Horizon 4 compared to Call Of Duty or Rainbow Six Siege. The 120 FPS is phenomenal, and for those who may not know, you can play at 120 FPS with HDMI 2.0 as long as it’s a 120+ hz screen. For 4K 120 FPS you need hdmi 2.1 which is harder to find. So if you want to play 120 FPS make sure the monitor you buy is capable of 120hz and has HDMI 2.0 and up.",

With VRR and 120hz games look amazing such as halo. Amazon made it fairly simple to secure one with a little persistence.The only flaw I’m seeing is it does get quite hot, so ensure it has room to breathe. Also the VRR seems to have a slight flickering issue with my specific model of TV which is fixable and never present in my actual games.Highly recommended. If you looking for speed and high quality graphics for your 120hz 4K Dolby Vision OLED, go Xbox. If you want to exclusive games with slightly less power, go PS5.

Xbox Series X,5.0,Next-gen in Subtle ways (as of right now),"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on December 5, 2020",Style: Series X | Pattern Name: Xbox,True,"Coming from an Xbox One X I can say this does feel like a next-gen leap, albeit not a huge one as of yet.The console is quiet, and the use of an SSD this generation means a very responsive UI and faster load times for games. There are a handful of Series X optimized games available but not a bunch. I bought Devil May Cry 5 Special Edition to go with this and the differences are noticeable. In addition to improved graphics and faster load times the Series X also beings Ray Tracing which made this particular game look even better.To summarize the console delivers on bringing a next-gen feel and if you have a One X already there are differences that make the purchase feel welcome. Granted, with the short supply of games out there using this to its fullest at this time, you would be forgiven for waiting a little longer to buy this. But for those that buy it now or plan to buy it, I can definitely recommend this.",2 people found this helpful

It is an excellent console, very well built. I love the backgrounds as well, they look neat. The controller is nice and the Master Chief Elite controller is the best controller I have ever used.The dashboard for the console is awful. Navigating the console menus is terrible. The photo video editing software is awful as well.The first party games are lacking as well. I played Gears 5 on it. I loved Gears 1-3 but was immediately turned off by 5 as the first thing I saw when I launched the game were $20. The campaign was a good one time play through. I struggled to get through the open worlds a second time as they are empty, pointless and out right boring. I loved the linear chapters, I thought they were great. I quickly grew bored of the multiplayer as it hasn’t changed since Gears 2 (I can’t believe there is still sticky cover).I played Halo Infinite and the game is unfinished. They continue to add cosmetics instead of content like maps. I grew bored of the game after a month.I am looking forward to Fable and Hellblade 2, but remain skeptical because of Microsoft’s heavy monetization practices. The focus seems to be on heavily monetizing first party games since they are available on GamePass. That is a huge turn off for the console.I do love some of the backwards compatible games, tbough most of the games I want remain unavailable.At this point, I haven’t touched the console in a few months as the GamePass games have been uninteresting for me personally. I can’t believe Halo, the launch title for this console, was unfinished and a massive disappointment. I just can’t wait for some great first party games, hopefully sooner rather than later and with no heavy monetization. I am also extremely disappointed to hear that Microsoft is already giving up on future backwards compatible titles from the 360 era as that was the best part about the console.",2 people found this helpful

The words on the home screen have turned pixelated and boxy looking. Shows and games are red or dark now. (See photos)This is ridiculous for the price we paid. I have no clue what we're supposed to do now besides be out all of this money for this piece of crap. My husband's has tried to troubleshoot with Xbox and has received no help.

The thoughts of not wanting to load up a new game because it would take too long to load up are gone forever with this generation.Conclusion:Microsoft has pulled out all the stops hardware and OS-wise. Once next generation games come out, the Xbox Series X will be the best way to game for years to come.",11 people found this helpful

The machine was set on its side, as I read it wss more prone to scratching disc's standing upright.Update: occasionally the machine just doesn't want to read discs. Microsoft has an issue with the disc player that could result in you having to send the unit back to MS for repair. System restarts seem to make the games playable again.

Xbox Series X,1.0,I wish I could give it 5 star but...,"Reviewed in the United States on November 19, 2020",Style: Series X | Pattern Name: Xbox,True," I wish I was able to give the Series X 5 stars but Microsoft customer service has killed it for me.A couple hours after receiving my Xbox it froze and after rebooting small pixel sized green squares littered the screen. I attempted swapping cables, changing TVs, and performing factory resets. In the end the issue would not go away.I decided to see if I could get a replacement through Amazon. Unfortunately they are currently out of stock. So the only option they provided was a refund or gift card.So I decided to give Microsoft support a shot, hoping that I could send it in for repair and get a replacement. This is where my journey of jumping hoops began.Microsoft only option for phone support is to fill out a form to have them call you, which is fine most of the time. After completing the form I was told I would receive a call in 90 minutes. 3 hours later I receive a call that the queue is full and my request was canceled. I would need to try again the next day.Next morning at 7am I refill out the form and receive a call from a human 2 minutes later. Woohoo! I explain my issues and the steps I took to trouble shoot. The service agent sets up a service request and says that I'll receive an email with what to do next.After hanging up and waiting a bit of time I receive the email and my shipping address is completely wrong from what I had told him on the phone....... So I hop online and resubmit the form to be called and I'm told it will be a 90 minute wait this time. 3 hours later I receive a call from a rep. I explain the mistake that was made on my address and he says that he needs to put me on hold so that he can escalate the issue. After being put on hold for 30 minutes  I abruptly get hung up on.After waiting to see if I would get a call back with no success I resubmit a request to be called online again. 4 hours later I get a call that the queue is full and my request has been canceled. I will need to try again tomorrow. I've owned every Xbox console that's been release and I would consider myself a bit of a fan boy. I shouldn't be required to jump through hoops like this when something doesn't work properly. This is EXTREMELY frustrating as a customer and has soured me a bit on the release of this console that I was super excited for a few months back.",118 people found this helpful

Not One S or One X but the base model.  It was a great console but the load times on many newer games were less than optimal.

You can expand your storage with a 1 TB expansion card.  Said card is overpriced but that's another story.I've had a 4K TV for years but my Xbox One only did 1080p (the One X is the only one that does 4K).

There is also a new share button on it that allows you to take screenshots of the games you are playing. If you hold the button down it records a game clip.

It was an early Christmas gift for a friend and he honestly loved it, the resolution is really high and you can tell there was a nice amount of work done and considering I have the Xbox one s, I can especially tell the difference. However, I do not like the shape nor the price, for a 560 price tag you would expect something extra like a second controller or, who knows a headset or something, but nothing. The packaging was kinda nifty tho where it wasn’t a traditional Xbox box. I also did not like the way it was super vertical so I can’t really find a good spot to fit it now without blocking the screen or put it on the floor and hope no one topples it’s over :/",

Games look waayy better especially with some games getting Auto HDR. Games also load faster when you transfer them to the internal drive same speeds fast of you use the series X expansion card. The main menu is still the same just more snappier same applies to the xbox store so that's good. Quick resume was a feature I was like ehh sounds good but whatever and I actually use it quiet often then I thought I would. My down side to it is that their isn't any new xbox game yet.

Gotta say that it's a pretty cool console. If you have an XONE or OneX you'll feel familiar with the ui since it's basically the same. Now there aren't that many games that scream Next gen yet. Though the upgrades for series x/s optimized games are very cool with more incoming. As it stands, besides things like quick resume(which has it's few issues like not working 100% of the time), faster loading times, this gen is barely starting. So don't fret if you haven't been able to get one yet. Another point with these new consoles (ps5 included) is that in order to play at 4k 120 frames per second you need a tv that has hdmi 2.1.

Xbox Series X,1.0,It's like a Ferrai with no wheels,"Reviewed in the United States on March 3, 2023",Style: Series X | Pattern Name: Xbox,True,"The XBOX Series X is a fast machine however, fast doesn't matter if you don't have wheels. Every game I play has the most uneven play. I am forever changing settings and rebooting for this status or that port. The games are the most inconsistent part of the Series X experience. Imagine taking input from thousands and thousands of players with different machines, different distances to the servers, different internet connections, and trying to make them equal. You can't. Save your money unless you want a really expensive BluRay player,ROKU/Fire Stick. In a nut shell, you spend $ on the machine, spend $ on the game, spend qtrly $ on XBOX Live to play the game, spend optional $ on game pass, and  money on in-game stuff, only to have extremely lopsided games. It's silly and I'm ashamed I fall for it every year 5 years and every year on the games. Read, hike, ride quads, go to the gym, go to the gun range, go ski, go to the beach, get a job, but stay away from this artery hardener.

Xbox Series X,4.0,Best Xbox console to date however...,"Reviewed in the United States on December 12, 2020",Style: Series X | Pattern Name: Xbox,True,"This is above and beyond the best Xbox console to date, however there are system updates still needed to improve the overall performance in games. Due to the fact that Microsoft waited for AMD to finalize the RDNA 2 feature set so the Series consoles could have the entire feature set, the system is behind in terms of max performance capabilities. Once these system updates roll out and the system fully utilizes the full RDNA 2 feature set and games are taking full advantage of them, we should see the full potential of the console. Early on there seems to be some slight performance issues with the cross gen titles at least. Still very happy with Xbox and the direction it's going as a gaming platform.",
Xbox Series X,5.0,Amazing,"Reviewed in the United States on November 24, 2021",Style: Series X | Pattern Name: Xbox,True,I’ve had my series X for about a year since it first dropped and I just have to say yes. Everything about it is great the load times are fast amazing picture and the cross gen feature is amazing. I could literally put my Xbox 360 games in and play it just fine. Also my old tv doesn’t support the 4K 120hz (I upgraded now) and the picture was still great most def worth the price.

Xbox Series X,1.0,This is what the XB One should have been,"Reviewed in the United States on August 22, 2022",Style: Series X | Pattern Name: Xbox,True,"Not impressed. This is what the XB One should have been. The dash is exactly as it is on the XB One so you immediately get the impression of no upgrade to ""Next gen"". Absolute failure on Micros part. Pure laziness. One star for better game load times but you can get that with ""upgrading"" your XB One and saving $$$$$. Games ""Enhanced for XB X"" show zero difference at all whatsoever so Micro must use a different dictionary defining ""enhanced"". I don't follow PS5 so I don't know or care what they have but the games on this X are pretty pathetic. The current gen of gamers must be so easily amused or enjoy the same games over and over  since they all look like repeats of last gen. Nothing new, nothing appealing. Gamepass is just as bad. Maybe nobody makes ""new"" games anymore. The games ""on sale"" on gamepass are ALWAYS the same garbage. The controller felt weird in my hands as I hated the texture they put on it. It felt like sand. Glad the original Xbox One S controller worked on it. Oh yeah, they added a new animation when you turn it on (woopty doo) then it takes you to the exact same dash. So nothing new. If Micro had actually put some time into overhauling the dash instead of being lazy and keeping the old one it may have been better but other wise it feels the same as XB One. Oh and all the marketing teraflops, wifi, blah blah blah......not even noticeable and not worth $500. Returned. Keep your XB Ones and upgrade it with ext SSD instead of forking out $500 for faster game load times.",11 people found this helpful

Shipping box was fine so this did not happen in transit. The xbox x box was trashed and I wondered if it was used but the listing was for new so I set it up anyway. I had to waitlist for it and I just wanted to play my games! Well, for two weeks I did. But then it stopped recognizing my controllers (both the one it came with and another I had bought from Best Buy) and then it stopped turning on at all. This is the last time I will ever purchase electronics from Amazon unless it’s something they make like kindle. Otherwise steer clear. The stuff they sell is damaged, defective and most likely already used.",One person found this helpful

This console IMO is made for online gaming as Xbox Gamepass gives you the best bang for your buck.

After two hours of playing that, it was ready to ask for my email address, but then told me that I am already using my email address so I must make a new one. Then it tells me that it will sell all of my information to everyone. Two days in and it tells me that it wants me to pick a color that will make this unique and mine, but then limits me to only a few colors. Then, no mater what color I pick, the thing just stays the same black cheap plastic color. it's going in the fire.",4 people found this helpful

When the series x came out, I decided to give my xbox one S to my kids so they could play their games.  If we try to play at the same time, even though it is not the same game, we aren't allowed.  Okay... surely it will work if I sign in with my Kid's xbox live account that is connected to mine through family controls right?  Nope.  Maybe there is a way to loan the game or transfer the license?  Nope.  Basically I'm SOL, and will be looking for physical used games this holiday season for my kids.  The technology is ready for digital licensing, but MS is not.  I suggest buying physical (preferably used so it hurts their bottom line) until they empower digital owners.The series x itself has been fine.

I then was played Gears 5 X/S for about 25 minutes and it the XBox X screeched, my LG OLED screen went blank and the system died and will not restart.

Xbox Series X,5.0,Best Xbox Console,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on January 22, 2023",Style: Series X | Pattern Name: Xbox,False,"I make most of my online purchases at Amazon but I bought two of these consoles elsewhere.  I had originally wanted the Halo Infinity Edition but couldn't get my hands on one without paying out the nose.  Even getting the standard Series X was tough in that everything seemed to have been out of stock every time I had checked.I then found some stock coming in at the Microsoft site and bought my standard Series X directly from them.  It came in and I was impressed by how well the unit worked.  It's whisper quiet and no longer required figuring out where to put the massive power brick.  That part is now internal.In terms of performance, the Series X loaded Halo in a fraction of the time as compared to on the Xbox One.  I also see no latency and the visuals look great on my big 4K TV.  Other games also load quickly and look great.When I was looking for the standard version of the Xbox Series X, I had purchased the Halo Infinity game and played it on my Xbox One.  When the Series X came in, I was able to continue on my new console the same game I had started on my Xbox One.  It downloaded my progress and let me continue with exception for not continuing at the exact same spot.  It picked up at the beginning of that mission but otherwise had all of my original progress.By chance, I ran into another trusted site that had come across some stock of the limited edition console at a somewhat elevated price ($699.99).  I bought it right away and gave my original console to my sister.  I can confirm for you that the differences are only cosmetic with the exception for the LE version including a download of Halo Infinity and there is a tone on the LE version whenever powering it on or off.  With the LE version including the new Halo game, my sister was given the physical copy of Halo Infinity.  With that said, I now own all but the original Halo versions of the consoles (360, XBO, and now XSX).  I feel comfort in that.I don't know if the LE version will ever be available again but the standard version is literally the same console in every way other than the cosmetics of the console itself, the controller, a tone, and its packaging.  much preferredVisually, I very  the LE version but not everyone is willing to burn the extra money for what is essentially a paint job on the console and controller.  In whichever case, I'm happy with both purchases and can recommend the console to anyone that wants the best available Xbox experience.",

Xbox Series X,4.0,The best game changer,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on December 13, 2022",Style: Series X | Pattern Name: Xbox,False,"Xbox Series X is a game changer in the gaming world. It plays true 4K gaming, up to 120 frames per seconds, 8K HDR (High Dynamic Range), and Xbox Velocity Architecture. You can play thousands of titles from the previous Xbox consoles which is a plus for me. I like to play Halo, Dead by Daylight, and Resident Evil. I had this system for 2 years and I recommend buying this product. In my experience in playing the Xbox series X I noticed the better graphics and faster loading screen. Also, Xbox Series X allows you to play backward compatible games from the previous consoles. This brings your old games back to life.The Xbox Series X or PS5 both go for $500 dollars. For the right investment I would choose Xbox Series X because the PS5 has a failed network issue meaning it can't connect to the internet which I’m sure most gamers would hate. PS5 also doesn't support dolby vision either so If you’re looking to just play Blu-ray discs with support of Dolby Vision for games, Blu-ray, or apps such as Netflix the Xbox Series X is the only one that supports it.Xbox Series X also only has a 1TB storage space which is limited but if you run out of space you can buy an expansion card or a hard drive to give you more. The reason why you would need more space is because it impacts the number of games you can install onto your system. Most games are 100 to 120 GB in file size so I would recommend buying a hard drive with more space because 1 TB would run out of space quickly.  The expansion card cost $219.99 dollars and the hard drive cost $25 to $300 dollars depending how much storage you want for your system.Some additional weaknesses of the Xbox Series X are the controller and where the share button is located. It's between the menu and the view button and it takes photos during game play because I accidentally hit the button which is annoying. Another disadvantage is not enough exclusive games because most games could also be found in the PC world. Also, keeping it in an enclosed space can cause the console to overheat and turn off which only happened once to me.In conclusion, the Xbox series X is a quality gaming system that is user friendly, built for faster speed, and worth the investment.",
Xbox Series X,5.0,Best Console on the market,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on January 12, 2023",Style: Series X | Pattern Name: Xbox,False,"1.

Superior gaming subscription, Xbox Game Pass crushes any gaming subscription especially Sony’s wannabe GamePass subscription: Sony won’t add their first party crappy interactive movies and simulators casuals call “games”. So Sony shills will keep wasting their parent’s money on those $70 flops. And you can’t play your crappy PS3 games locally. They are all on the crappy laggy cloud and they don’t have online functionality LOL. On Xbox you can locally play a lot of older games from the OG Xbox onwards at higher resolutions and with better frame rates and ONLINE multiplayer that still works.4. Superior UI, advanced feature rich UI that’s lightyears better than PoS5’s original downgraded Xbox one UI.5. Superior graphics, XSX can handle native 8K while Crapstation 5 struggles with 4K.6. Superior FPS, XSX easily plays optimized or non optimized games on 60FPS and 125 FPS. And of course there’s FPS boost, original Xbox, 360 and last gen games can all play on 60 FPS or more thanks to this next gen feature. PoS5 could only dream.7. Superior cloud gaming. Xcloud is the best cloud gaming service on the market. It has the least lags compared to others especially compared to that RESKINNED FLOP called PS Now. FYI, OnLive was a cloud gaming service that flopped back in 2015 and then was bought by Soyny and renamed it as “PS Now”. Crappy Sony couldn’t make their own cloud service. How embarrassing.8. Superior HDR. Xbox series X/S has auto HDR where last gen games get automatic graphic enhancement with better colors and texture. While Crapstation 5 is stuck with SD looking “games”.9. Xbox’s cloud storage for saved games is not locked behind a subscription/paywall unlike PoS5 where’s you need to pay extra to get basic default feature.10. And of course Superior games, Xbox has an ACUTAL games that are great like the Forza, Halo and Gears of War series where Crapstation only has crappy interactive movies and simulators that only overhyped by so called gaming “journos” because they’re PoS exclusive (majority of them are to coming to PC lol so much for buying PS5).So use your brain and buy the XSX, an actual next-gen console with next-gen features (Quick Resume, Auto HDR, FPS Boost) instead of that overhyped glorified PoS 4 pro.",
Xbox Series X,1.0,Very disappointed. Major issues causing some games to be unplayable.

The disc drive doesn’t read discs after u turn the console off unless u eject and reinsert.

""There wasn't any buying restrictions.""Moving to a new platform isn't something I wanted. I have a little over 400 games for the PS4, over 140 for PS3, and a 100Gallon tote of PS2 games.For Original Xbox I have Halo, & Halo 2 for the Xbox 360, Halo Reach.Why order so many?Most of my friends are using PlayStation as their sole game platform. ""like me.""If I'm moving to a new platform, I'm bringing a few friends with me with me.-Friends from yesteryears who've since moved all over the country and started families.-We might not have a lot of time to play now, but~""Gaming with old friends is as close as it gets to hanging out at the park together as adults w/o airfare.""The ReviewPerformanceThe overall responsiveness of this system is great.Most games load in under 2 seconds, and multitasking doesn't bog the unit down.The UpgradesIt has upgradable storage either via a proprietary external expansion slot, or for the less faint of heart;~~It comes with a internal 1TB internal 20x42 M.2 PCIE SSD. If your Xbox is out of Warranty, or you don't care about that sort of thing. It's easily changed or even modded to take a full size 22x80 or 22x110 M.2 cards.-A little technical know how never hurts.**Be informed: The M.2 is uses PCIE gen 4. Gen 4 is backwards compatible with Gen 3 & will work****There can be speed variations, but just think of it as you GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR**~Not all chips behave the same.  (LTT might have a breakdown)SubscriptionsThere are a few types of subscriptions now for Xbox of varying prices.They can get rather expensive and cost almost half as much as the console per year.-Everything is subscription these days.""I'm sure it won't be long b4 we need a subscription for the brakes to work in our cars""The Ultimate pass seems to be the best as it lets you access the EA and Microsoft games libraries of games to play for one monthly price.-Great for someone like me who has next to Zero Xbox games.*Ultimate Pass also gives you the ability to stream or play games on a PC or Mobile devices.*TBH: The subscription model and little time I play, might leave this a paper weight collecting dust on a shelf.My state charges taxes on Digital goods. So, a yearly subscription will cost just over $200.The ControllerOne thing I wish Microsoft would address is their HORRIBLE controller design.  -1 StarNot that the controller is all bad. In fact it's considerably more durable than the DS4 controller.-I've literally twisted DS4 controllers in half while gaming, and the way my hands hardly can hold the Xbox controller, it feels like it would just slip out during any intense game sessions.-I've absolutely hated these controllers since day one and still to this day.""Maybe It'll grow on me this time?""--Side noteSomeone make  a controller for people with XXL large hands.",One person found this helpful

Xbox Series X,4.0,Vast Improvement Over Xbox One,"Reviewed in the United States on January 23, 2022",Style: Series X | Pattern Name: Xbox,False,"If there was ever a company that needed to beg for forgiveness after the last generation of consoles, it was Microsoft. While I did consider the Xbox One the more graphically impressive between it and the PS4, the systems user-friendliness was about as easy as a calculus test. In fact, if your internet went down for some reason, you were the proud owner of $500 blu-ray player. Unless you chose not to download the blu-ray, then you owned a huge black box.For the Xbox Series X, Microsoft makes a bunch of noticeable improvements. First is the installation. Installing this console is much less time consuming and is surprisingly small in size (1.2gb). However, the reason this is is because the console is already pretty much installed with its programming, which takes up a huge 200gb’s of the terabyte hard drive, so that’s a bit of a bummer. Another interesting update is updating the controller after installation, which is a bit odd.However, one huge improvement is the passkey feature, which allows you to login to the console without internet. Obviously, you’ll still need internet to install any digital games and some physical games do require you to be connected to the internet to finish the installations. For instance, Red Dead Redemption 2 will show as complete but you’ll need to be online to open the game the first time, but the game can be opened offline after that.Graphically, the console is great and all of the games have run smoothly so far without a hitch, both new and old. For instance, Red Dead Redemption 2, which was like a frame rate nightmare at times on Xbox One X, even with patches, runs smoothly with just the physical installation and looks better. Then there is the new version of Flight Simulator, which looks fantastic.If there is one element to this console that keeps it out of the five star range, it’s the interface, which is remarkably unchanged from the Xbox One. In fact, if you were to walk into the room without seeing the console itself, you might actually think you were still playing the Xbox One. Navigating through menus is still difficult and it’s easy to forget where certain selections and features are. Granted this is not new, Microsoft has always sacrificed simplicity with cool looks dating back to the original Xbox.Also, you still have to install the Blu-Ray player app. I know that’s a small thing, but the fact that this extremely expensive console can’t play movies by default is a bit insulting. Especially considering the amount of money it takes just to buy the dang thing.So overall, a vast improvement over every version of the Xbox One. While there are certain details that could use improvement, unlike the Xbox One, there is no shame in saying you have a Microsoft console this time.",5 people found this helpful

Xbox Series X,4.0,A great console that doesn’t feel quite next gen,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on April 2, 2022",Style: Series X | Pattern Name: Xbox,False,"I walked into the store a few weeks ago with no intention of buying a new console and walked out with an SX that wasn’t spoken for. I’m still surprised at how easy it was.The SX is noticeably faster than the One X. Auto HDR is good but doesn’t work on every game. FPS boost is good but works on even less games than Auto HDR. Quick Resume is revolutionary but buggy and unreliable and again, doesn’t work on every game. Boosted rez, 120hz and VRR, and framerate are great but RT is a bit overrated. I’m very happy that my Xbox One controllers are forward compatible on the SX.My biggest issue is that the SX doesn’t “feel” next generation. Everything from the UI, the “new” controller, to the gen 9 games themselves don’t feel particularly next level over the One X. The SX feels like an iteration of the One X instead of a next level console. It’s sort of like owning a 991 then buying a 991.2. Sure it’s a new car with slightly better interior and updated body and faster performance but the hard points are the same and isn’t nearly as big a jump as moving from the 991 to the 992.I get that we are at the point of diminishing returns. I recall getting an SNES, popping in Super Mario World, and knowing on the spot that this was a next level game on a next gen console that looked and played better than Super Mario Bros. 1-3. I know that ain’t happening again but as good as the SX is, I can’t help but feel a twinge of disappointment and I’m happy that I didn’t go through the hassle of preordering, calling every store in the area, madly pounding refresh on the computer for hours, or bribing a store employee for a console that does not astound me out of the gate",One person found this helpful

The newest iteration of Xbox is simply put, the best yet.Microsoft really stumbled throughout most of the last generation but have mostly fixed all of their mistakes this time around. For the 1st time in years I am super excited to see what the team at Xbox has in store for us!Once we finally get some more of these games they've been teasing I'll be even happier. But as far as hardware goes, this console is a beast. Gone are the days of long loading times - I typically would browse my phone during loading screens, but that's a thing of the past! I was in awe of how quickly games loading between cur scenes and the like. It's truly a next gen experience.For anyone in the fence or waiting to buy a PS5 instead - you're doing yourself an injustice not to pick this bad boy up. With cutting edge hardware, 4 generations of games, and new games continually dropping on Game Pass you won't be disappointed!",

Xbox Series X,4.0,Best bang-for-buck system,"Reviewed in the United States on April 18, 2022",Style: Series X | Pattern Name: Xbox,False,"I purchase this product from a physical retailer, not Amazon. Your mileage may vary.The Series X is a very solid console. It has addressed almost all of the shortcomings of the previous generation Microsoft consoles, with minor exceptions. It loads far faster thanks to the integrated Solid State storage combined with Microsoft's Xbox Velocity architecture.Performance has been improved across the board, with up to 4k and up to 120 fps in all modern launches and even having these features added to past titles as old as the original Xbox through Backwards Compatibility and FPS Boost.Features like 1440p support and VRR/Freesync support put the Series X above the competition, which at the time of writing and at the time of launch don't/didn't have these features. VRR is by no means mandatory, but it is helpful in games that allow variable or unlocked frame rates or that have optimization issues such as Fromsoft's latest release.The console gets warm, but it stays incredibly quiet at all times. The disk drive is far louder than the fans, and with the recent addition of Night Mode, the console and controllers can be completely incognito even when in use by turning off their built-in LED lights.Overall, definitely a swing and a home run from Microsoft. If you're gaming on the previous gen, struggling to find modern PC hardware for an affordable price, or simply interested in getting into the world of Game Pass (another excellent deal from Microsoft), the Series X is for you.",

Xbox Series X,5.0,Absolutely Pleased in Every Way,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on January 18, 2022",Style: Series X | Pattern Name: Xbox,False,"So for starters, this is a review of the actual Series X, not about the scalper prices.I got mine for MSRP.With that out of the way, this thing is incredible. Backwards compatible with ALL XBOX console games, XBOX, XBOX 360, XBOX ONE, yep, ALL OF THEM.And many of those games benefit from having HDR, and 4k upscaling. It really does breathe new life into old games. This also means you can buy older xbox or 360 games for super cheap at used games stores, and have a blast. Maybe games you didn't buy because they were too expensive. Now, you can.The Gamepass subscription service is unbeatable. PS5 doesn't have anything EVEN CLOSE. Neither does Switch. It sets this console head and shoulders above the competition. Unless you want some specific PS5 exclusives (which is absolutely valid, they have some bangers), the Series X is the clear winner. It's also quite a bit more compact than the PS5, the PS5 is gigantic compared to this thing.One thing you'll have to remember; if you don't have a 4k 120hz TV? You won't be getting the most out of this. If you have a 1080p television, save yourself some money, and buy a Series S.But if you DO have a 4k 120hz TV, it's a game changer (no pun). It feels next gen. Forza Horizon 5 graphics are incredible for a console. MS Flight Simulator looks about 96% as good on the Series X, as it does on a $3000 gaming rig. Yes, really.The instant resume feature is killer. Playing a game but your girlfriend wants to watch a movie with you? No waiting to get to a save point, flip over to Netflix, watch a movie, flip back over to the game, and you're right where you left off.Cons: Internal storage seems huge at 1TB, but with Gamepass, you'll want to get the additional 1TB storage card.You can also use an external hard drive, BUT - and this is key, YOU CANNOT RUN GAMES FROM THE EXTERNAL HARD DRIVE. You can only run them from the 1TB expansion card. Honestly I will probably buy the 2TB expansion card when it comes out. Game Pass will use a lot of storage.The controller it comes with is excellent, but I have had issues with it disconnecting occasionally. It's not a big deal with a lot of games, but if you're say, racing online, it's a problem. I have read that repairing the controller sorts this issue, so I'll try that.Conclusion:I've owned a Series X for about a year, and I couldn't be happier with it. I still might get a PS5, because of some of their excellent exclusives, but the Series X is an absolute STEAL - if you can find one.",3 people found this helpful

Xbox Series X,5.0,Makes Xbox One S seem ancient,"Reviewed in the United States on February 10, 2022",Style: Series X | Pattern Name: Xbox,False,"Comparison story: I've owned at one model of every generation of Xbox since the original with the previous one being an Xbox One S. I'd been playing Forza Horizon 5 on the One S connected to my 4K TV since November. The graphics were pretty good but the startup and load times were horrible. I could do tasks in other rooms while waiting for racing events to load. Then my Xbox Series X arrived this week.After downloading a system update and then Forza, I was ready to see the difference. Blown out of my mind. Startup and load times are so fast they are practically not noticeable. Combine that with the ability to do 'quick resume' for previously loaded games, and you can be playing in no time at all. Now I barely have time to see if there are any messages on my phone, let alone go do some task in another room. And the graphics are out of this world. In Forza if I stop at a field of flowers and I see that each flower has petals. Flamingos at the waterfall have feathers. Pineapple plants have serrated edges. Banana plants have tears and holes in the leaves. Pros: Amazing graphics and speed Smaller than a PS5Negatives:- Storage of 1TB (which is even smaller due to system files) Games that are designed specifically for the Series S/X must be stored on the internal drive or an expensive proprietary Seagate external drive. But games can be moved to an external HDD or SSD if you aren't planning on playing it for a while.- Seems to consume more power than my One S. Running my TV, surround sound and Xbox through a UPS and 500-watt power transformer, the transformer could not handle the load when gaming on the Xbox Series X while it could easily handle it on the One S.Conclusion: If you can find one at MSRP prices, this should be a no-brainer of a decision for any gamer.",2 people found this helpful

Xbox Series X,4.0,Welcome to the next level,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on April 5, 2022",Style: Series X | Pattern Name: Xbox,False,"Well I finally got my hands on a Series X a week ago. I thought I'd give my overall thoughts on what I of how I felt about the console. I decided to break it down into sections for readability.DesignWhile it shares much of the design language of the Xbox One S and X, the Series X is decidedly larger and heavier. It looks like a mini tower PC but still maintains that utilitarian design of its predecessors. It somehow is both imposing and minimalist at the same time. I like that the exhaust is more out of the way and the front USB port is more accessible than previous models, but some might struggle to fit it comfortably into their setup. It won't win any awards for originality, but in my opinion, it's the best looking Xbox since the 360 slim.Operating systemIf you've used an Xbox One in the past 5 years or so, you should be instantly familiar with with GUI. While it cab be a bit much to take in if you've never used it, you should be navigating around the menus with ease after a day or so. There are options that are a little too buried for my liking, but Microsoft is constantly updating the OS, so it may change if enough people complain.ControllerUnlike Sony, Microsoft has keep the basic controller design intact since 2013 with the Xbox One, and even that wasn't that big of a redesign of the 360 controller. What has changed is mostly minor, the micro USB port is now a USB C port, a share button has been added, the d-pad has been redesigned, and some texture was added for better grip. It also maintains the improvements from the last gen mid cycle upgrade including a headphone jack and Bluetooth. Some may be disappointed that it still uses AA batteries, but the argument could be made that it gives the controller more longevity and flexibility. Regardless, these minor changes will likely not sway anyone who had strong opinions either way.CapabilitiesAs someone who up until last week was using an Xbox One S, I was really hoping to see a substantial leap. I can't say my mind was blown. In many ways, the Series X feels like a natural evolution. The big thing to understand with that statement is, everything I have access to was built on last generation technology, so I can't really see the full potential just yet. I will say that the upgraded games that I did try looked substantially better. I felt Gears 5 and Doom Eternal looked and ran substantially better. Borderlands 3 was never a looker, but loading in 1 minute instead of 5, with a smooth framerate made it much more enjoyable. Forza Horizon 4 and Ori and the Will of the Wisps failed to impress though. The most impressive aspect of non-optimized games are the auto HDR and the framerate boost. Gears of War 2 and Forza Horizon 1 may show their age but on Series X, they're surprisingly modern looking for such old games. The point that I'm making is, the hardware is incredibly capable and the potential is there, I just feel like we need to wait a bit longer to truly see it.GamesIt's no secret that these new consoles are hard to come by and developers have been slow to switch over to current gen games. That doesn't mean there haven't been some games to play, just that they're almost entirely games you could have played on your Xbox One with worse performance. Some good examples of games that show off what the console is capable of today are Halo Infinite, Forza Horizon 5, Flight Simulator, Cyberpunk 2077, Elden Ring, Dying Light 2, and The Medium. I'm not personally recommending games, just saying that these are as ""next gen"" as we can get on the Series X. I suppose that may be disappointing to read, but you really are buying this console for its potential, not its current offerings. If Microsoft can put those recently purchased studios to good use, the Series X will be a powerhouse.Odds and endsI just wanted to throw in a few little bits of information. Most people are already aware of these facts, but it doesn't hurt to include in in the review. Yes, the console is fully backwards compatible with all games that are on the Xbox One, this includes backwards compatible Xbox 360 and original Xbox games, you'll also get the One X enhancements on any game that had it previously.The Xbox One was great for media and so is the Series X. You're still getting the same playback options including CD's (an odd omission from the Playstation) DVD's, and both standard and UHD Blu ray's. It's also got a fairly capable media player app.Nearly every accessory from the Xbox one is compatible including Xbox One controllers, and arcade sticks. The Kinect however, is not compatible, even with the USB adapter.  You're also losing the HDMI in port and toslink (sometimes called SPIDIF or optical); neither one was particularly useful to me personally, but your millage may vary.In terms of storage, you can bring over any compatible USB hard drive, but you won't be able to play Series X/S optimized games off of those drives, they're too slow. I thought this was common knowledge but I've seen reviews of Xbox branded hard drives getting 1 star reviews because people didn't realize this. You'll need the expensive SSD cards sold by Microsoft to play those games. Alternatively, you can just move games between an external drive and the internal storage. It's a pain to move games, but it's a good solution until you can save up the money.Overall thoughtsThe Series X ultimately feels like getting a new PC. The same games are there, but many now have a fresh coat of paint. If you're upgrading from a Xbox One and have an external drive, the process is seamless, it even uses the same cables. And while it isn't this fully fleshed out ""next gen"" experience, even a year later, it has the potential to be. Recommended.",One person found this helpful

Xbox Series X,5.0,Amazing! Best Console yet,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on December 16, 2020",Style: Series X | Pattern Name: Xbox,False,"Amazing.  I held out on the One X because there had been whispers of this next gen console for several years, so I figured I would just go all in whenever it came out.  I was one of the fortunate few who were able to snag a pre order, and I have been playing daily since launch.  The performance is unbelievable.  There obviously isn't much in the way of Series X games yet, but I have been catching up on some Xbox One games I haven't played, notably Doom Eternal and Control so far.  If those are considered last gen games running on the Series X, I can't imagine how games could look or perform much better.  They look incredibly great, and load times are basically non-existent.  It's just a joy playing.Packaging and set up really feel top notch.  They went over the top with the packaging, it feels really nice opening.  Set up is very easy too, similar to setting up a google product.  You do it all through your phone, and it is very easy and painless.  I was worried when there were reports of it ""running hot like a furnace"" pre launch, but those reports are pretty laughable.  It doesn't get any hotter than any other console I've had, and it actually probably runs much cooler than my old OG Xbox 360 that bit the dust a while back.  The great thing that you wont notice as well, is that it is super quiet.  The only time I hear it is when its whirring whenever I power it on.The only minor negatives I have are that it is big, and IMO a little ugly.  However it is smaller and I think better looking than the PS5.  I have it set up horizontally on my entertainment center, and it doesn't look quite right.  Its obviously made to be set up vertically, but I don't know anyone who puts their consoles in a vertical position, and not to mention you can't really put it in an entertainment center that way.  But when you're playing, who cares how it looks?  The other thing is that quick resume is finicky.  It doesn't work ALL the time, but when it does it's amazing.  You can literally power on the console, and you're playing exactly where you left off last time in about 30 seconds.  I also wish there were an SPDIF out for my AV receiver.If you're a gamer and deciding between the Series X or the Series S, I think in the long run the Series X is absolutely a better bet.  The main thing that scared me off on the Series S is the memory, and the lack of a disc drive.  The cost of the expandable storage is exorbitantly expensive, and the 500GB will probably fill up fast on the Series S.  If you buy the S and the proprietary storage, you're already at the cost of the Series X.  However the 1 TB on the Series X is perfect.  I currently have 13 games, between One and 360 versions, with about 50% storage remaining.  However, I'm sure future games will take some more space.  Overall, I am overly happy with this, and has made my quarantine time actually enjoyable.  Just do not buy from resellers on ebay, as I am sure more are coming available very soon.",

Make sure to do some research because the number of games is significantly less than advertised.  Also, XBox 360 controllers are NOT compatible with the Series X/S.Otherwise a solid system overall.  I think the Series X is a better buy than the Series S simply due to the 4K and overall power of the system…even if you don’t have 4K, you’ll have a smoother ride with the X since it will have far greater longevity… eventually they will push the limits of the hardware, so the Series S will not be able to keep up as well.

Xbox Series X,4.0,An engineering triumph for quiet gaming,"Reviewed in the United States on August 18, 2021",Style: Series X | Pattern Name: Xbox,False,"This XSX is one quiet, elegant black box, possibly the least obtrusive and best behaved technology I’ve owned in decades of computing and gaming going back to the TRS-80 and Commodore VIC-20. I jumped ship from Sony for it and haven’t looked back.For me, these are the strengths separating it in mid-2021 from the PS5:Functionally silentClassic modernist design of “less is more”Nearly invisible in a darkened room for nighttime gamingI sit six to seven feet from the unit while playing and am simply never aware it is on. That, in my sound-sensitive universe, is sheer brilliance. Could it be prettier, flashier? If that motivates you then look to the PS5, with its flair for being noticed; I wanted a machine with the DNA of a tongueless ghost. A machine for an adult who no longer thinks much of flashy plastic or the fans blasting inside it.Reason for four stars: the loud clacking new controller design, which makes the sound of crickets being ground to dust on a disco floor. Whoops. Microsoft giveth with one hand, taketh with the other! But no worries: new old stock XBox One controllers FTW.So, one serene machine. It’s ideal for 4K gaming as well as streaming fights on DAZN and classic Twilight Zone on HULU. Even as PS5 owners fret about noisy fans, I could simply not be happier with this console from a performance perspective. Note to Sony: come up with something as refined as the XSX in your next product refresh and we’ll talk. There’s room on my desk for more stuff, as long as it’s made with love and care.",

Xbox Series X,5.0,A Great System (for $500),"Reviewed in the United States on January 25, 2021",Style: Series X | Pattern Name: Xbox,False,"Before I begin, while I find the Xbox Series X easier to buy than the PS5, it is no stranger to being scalped like it's Sony and Nintendo counterparts.  If you are having a hard time getting this system, please be patient and don't pay scalper prices on eBay and Amazon.Now, to start off this review, I wouldn't fight said scalpers for one reason, games.  As of now, most games coming to the system haven't had release dates yet, as far as I know, and I don't think the studios Microsoft have bought have released any details on games for the system.  However, if you're a long time Xbox player, I do think things like Game Pass and backwards compatibility offer pretty decent value for the system.  With Game Pass, it's already a great value with around a hundred games to play (and Xbox Live Gold is included), and the system is also compatible with four generations of games (with some Xbox One games having upgrades).  While not every game is compatible, I find Microsoft's way of handling backwards compatibility better than Sony's PS5, which is only compatible with PS4 and PS5 games.  Only issue with the hardware/software side is the Xbox Live Gold requirement for online play.  If you're on Game Pass, you don't have to worry since it's included, but even if other systems are doing it, it's a paywall that needs to go away.  As of writing, consumers prevented the service from going up in price, and now Gold isn't required for free-to-play title no more (like how they're not required on other systems), but an online multiplayer subscription will never be a good value unless they use dedicated servers, and let's admit this, some games still use peer-to-peer (or console-to-console).I also like the hardware Microsoft was able to create.  While people could say that the system is big, I can say as a person who built an ITX PC, I would've loved to have a case this small.  It's a sleek box that's just barely taller than two GameCubes that also ran pretty cool and quiet.  While the SSD is half the speed of the PS5's on paper, I found that the games still load rather quickly.  The one trick Xbox has vs PS5's speed is Quick Resume, which allows your games to pick up right from where you left off.  This works great when you're playing a game like Crash Bandicoot 4 and a friend invites you to a quick game online.  Just switch to that game, and when you're done, switch back, and it'll be like you never left the game.Next is the new controller, and while it isn't a massive departure from previous controllers, it's the best one Microsoft has produced.  First, let me say that if you don't like the new controller (some people do say it is a smaller than the One controller), the Xbox One controllers work just fine with the new system, which is actually pretty pro-consumer of them.  What I do like about this controller, however, is the new d-pad.  It is based off the Elite controllers, and your thumb can easily roll around on it.  The controller also has a nice textured back, which gives a bit more grip.  The only issues I have are that it's still the same Xbox controller from the Xbox One, more or less.  There is still no gyro control (which I think it needs since gyro is the closest thing consoles like PlayStation and Switch have to mouse controls) or anything like the DualSense's adaptive triggers, and why in the 2020s does a controller still use AA batteries?  I know people have strange opinions and that I can buy rechargeable batteries for the controller, which I have received as Christmas presents, but even a $50 Switch Pro alternative controller, 8BitDo's SN30 Pro+, still has gyro and a removable, rechargeable battery, but Microsoft charges $60-65 for a controller that uses AA batteries.  Don't get me wrong, it's still a fine controller, great even, but Microsoft needs to catch up with everyone else, because before long, their controllers will start to feel outdated.Overall, I think that the Xbox Series X is a great system with even greater potential.  If Microsoft can utilize the",

Xbox Series X,1.0,2 out of 2 units bad out of the box,"Reviewed in the United States on January 31, 2023",Style: Series X | Pattern Name: Xbox,False,"I purchased the unit for Christmas, and unfortunately almost immediately there were problems. I noticed that there were no usual stickers to prevent opening, so I had wondered if the unit was returned, especially because the cords did not seem to be factory sealed. The unit did not seem to work well; controllers wouldn't stay connected, games would not open, it was nowhere near as good as our previous generation Xbox. I called Microsoft to discuss some of the problems I was having and they said the unit was bad, so ultimately I had to return and purchase a new one. When I received the new one, there were a lot of stickers in order to open the box, so It seemed clear that I had previously received a returned unit. I had a lot of hope for the second unit. I have not had it connected more than 12 hours and we are not only having all the same problems, but it's even worse. Furthermore, since there wasn't able to simply exchange it because this model was a little bit more because it included games we had already own and was the only option at the big box store. I actually had to pay a difference to get this model to have the same issues. I'm at a loss for what to do, we sold our previous generation Xbox with a Blu-ray, so this is our only way of viewing DVDs and blu-rays. I do completely regret the purchase and worry about the longevity of this hardware.",
Xbox Series X,5.0,Blows Away The PS5,"Reviewed in the United States on January 20, 2021",Style: Series X | Pattern Name: Xbox,False,"Why you may ask, well basically the only reason I've ever owned a Playstation, which I do like a lot is for it's amazing exclusives. No one can argue with it having the best! That being said the PS5 is nothing more than a glorified PS4 Pro, which i own and I'll keep until they don't support it anymore. Speaking of Pros here are the Pros and Cons of the Xbox Series, vs the PS5 and why it's much better imo.Pros.12 Teraflops as opposed to 10 tf in the PS5, many think this doesn't make a difference but for overall bandwith and graphical abilities it does make a difference.Game Pass is just a no brainer, along with my near 300 digital game collection I get over 100 that are free, with a small subscription which blows PS Now out of the water, because it's mostly all streaming (games) anyway.The graphical differences on PS4 exclusives using backwards compatibility on the PS5 is pathetic compared to the Xbox Series X. The XSX uses better texture filtering, 16x antiostropic filtering on ALL games, including enhancements from the Xbox One X (which is still a great console). So games look better, more colorful and the enhanced games just look out of this world. I tried many on the PS5 I had for a short time and could barely tell any differences. Also it uses Ps4 Pro code for all of it's games. In that case not raising the resolution at ALL on many titles. Which most had hoped for.You get 3 generations of backwards compatibility on the Series X, which I thought might not be that great and I would want new games, but it's a blast just to test them out to see how much better they look and play. Until Next gen only games arrive. Also speaking of which. The new Sony Exclusives (about 90%) will be on the PS4/Pro as well as Ps5. So what's the point?So overall the XSX just feels more premium, and looks a lot better. The PS5 is this hideous looking abomination that looks like some new building they just built in Dubai. It would be okay as a decorative piece like a vase or something. But I literally couldn't even stand to look at it sitting with my other consoles. It was immense. No I don't hate playstation but the Ps5 is by far the worst console I think they've ever made. And this could possibly be the best console Xbox/Microsoft ever make. And possibly the last, from what rumors say. So do yourself a favor, don't listen to the hype for PS5, and at this point don't bother. Wait a few years.Also with the XSX, just like the Xbox One, you can hook up ANY size external HDD to store games (an SSD external is needed to play the enhanced games) but that's no big deal Since the transfer from Ex to SSD is very very fast. With PS5 there are all sorts of issues with storage messing up, not working at all, rebuilding the database etc. Also I think the max is an 8tb hdd, also you can't use it for Media, MKV's, AVI's and such nearly as much as you can on the XSX. Which I also use for Netflix, Primes, Pluto TV, listening to MP3's and downloaded movie files etc.A couple things I don't like about the Series X, which are very few, is that the controller feels very cheap. The buttons smash in to easily, and it feels as if it could break after long periods of play. I really like the 360 controller (best ever made) and the original Xbox One controller. Which is compatible with the XSX, so if something goes wrong you can always use an old one. And sometimes it does have trouble syncing up right form the start, but that's easily rectified by hitting the button on the console.Lastly the console is whisper quiet, no issues to speak of. The PS5 I had, did seem a little quirky but not really bad, but I think more people have problems with it, and it does run much hotter. And I noticed the XSX SSD is slightly faster than the PS5's, which i found strange, but awesome at the same time. So I think this time MS may get back the crown they lost after the flop of the XB1. Which they deserve because the 360 was hands down the best console they ever had. Now it looks like the XSX is on it's way up. Maybe even the Series S will help, but imo get this, it's powerful, quiet, nice to look at and will definitely stand the test of time. Very future proof indeed. ENJOY!",2 people found this helpful

While an expansion slot is available. The onboard storage is outdated in terms of size, but blazing fast with speed. The graphics and cpu while powerful all becomes undone by very low storage capacity and constantly needing to transfer larger and larger files usually done via Downloads while ISPs institute data caps. You can try buying an external hard drive but you will need to transfer the games back and fourth as Xbox has made it impossible to play off external drives. Making their expansion slot the only go to option. Hence bringing about yet another monopoly from Microsoft. While some have said powered drives can achieve external gameplay I’ve yet to find one. This next gen storage given todays game sizes should be at a minimum 5 Tb.

A couple of months ago, the problems started. It wouldn't read some game discs at all. Now it is worse than ever and only about half of all discs work. If you do some research online, you will learn this is an epidemic. It is not a one in a million problem. I know quite a bit about software, hardware and even some programming. It is hard for me to be believe this is a hardware issue and not software. If it's software, that makes me wonder if it is being done on purpose in order to force you to download games direclty from them. Instead of using gamefly for instance. And so much for a friend bringing a game disc over for you to play.You would think I would have learned my lesson after going through 2 xbox 360's due to the red ring of death. I will NEVER buy another microsoft product after this. I should have went with my first instinct and bought a playstation. My atari 2600 I bought in 1978 worked just fine. Put in a cartridge and it played. End of story. Today? They can't even pull that off. And this is progress??? Consider this your warning.

Xbox Series X,5.0,PC experience without the pc,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on February 4, 2021",Style: Series X | Pattern Name: Xbox,False,"We've always been launch purchasers of new consoles, dating all the way back to the Ps2.  This time around I figured there wasn't a need.  I seldom play games.  My older son uses the ps4 and younger son has a proper gaming pc and pretty much dumped the xbox one.  Heard about the shortages and difficulty buying the X.  An opportunity came up and I noticed the option of going with Game Pass Ultimate, which includes the console, xbox live and a slew of games for around $36 a month.  I spend more than that for siriusxm, netflix and another streaming service combined (heck that's was week and a half's cost of beer for me until I stopped drinking).  Figured what the heck and jumped on it.  Got it set up and had the option of installing games I'd purchased on xbox, xbox 360 and xbox one (there's backwards compatibility) or a bunch of games on xbox game pass.  Installed the first game, Star Wars. Jedi Fallen Order.  It's a game about a year and a half old.  It looks amazing, even on my 1080p plasma set.  I highly recommend going the game pass route, especially if you like the Microsoft published games (since they're included).  It's going to take months to play through a handful of games accessible.  And both of my kids are all of a sudden re-interested in Xbox.  It's definitely an investment.  But well worth it.Update....Game pass ultimate adds another perk, cloud gaming.  I've linked my controller to my laptop via bluetooth and am able to play xbox games hosted on MS servers.  This only adds more to the incredible value of Game Pass Ultimate.  People piss away mad money on streaming services.  For under $40 you can get a teriffic console, xbox live and game pass.  Don't hesitate.  Go for it!!!",2 people found this helpful
Xbox Series X,5.0,For class,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on October 11, 2021",Style: Series X | Pattern Name: Xbox,False,"The Xbox Series X has a powerful Graphics Processing Unit (GPU), a great cooling system, and 16GB of Random Access Memory (RAM). It comes equipped with a custom AMD RDNA 2 GPU. The GPU is made up of 12 teraflops. In fact, the Xbox Series X is considered to be the most powerful console ever made. One single fan cools it, and keeps it from overheating. Specifically, the fan works in a vortex motion; therefore, it causes hot air to be blown out the top. When standing vertically the Xbox is pulling air from the bottom of the console. The Xbox comes with 16GB of GDDR6 RAM. GDDR6 is one of the fastest types of ram that you can possibly buy. To summarize, The Xbox Series X has some of the best internals for its $500 price point. It allows one to play games with a stable frame rate, and play for long periods of time without overheating.",

Xbox Series X,5.0,Don't Call it a Comeback...,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on July 5, 2021",Style: Series X | Pattern Name: Xbox,False,"Rap references aside, the Series X truly does feel like a culmination of Microsoft's experience and lessons learned from their previous generations of making consoles. No rocky launch or missteps here. Absolutely nothing about the Series X feels half-baked. It is a sleek, quiet and powerful system.I really appreciate that they allow the user to adjust so many settings to maximize their TV/Monitor setup. You can let the system automatically choose your output settings and be guaranteed a great picture. However, OCD tinkerers, like myself, can adjust settings such as Variable Refresh Rate, 120fps, and HDR to our liking. The user interface is easy to use but still offers advanced features - the perfect sweet spot. This all comes together to make it feel like a console designed by gamers with other gamers in mind.Some thoughts on backwards compatibility - While most gamers are always looking forward to the next hot game, many of us still like to revisit older games. Microsoft gets this and it's important. Not only do they keep these older games available, thus preserving them, but in many cases they have actually improved the game by adding features like Frame Rate Boost and Auto-HDR. They even make these features optional for those who just want to play the original, purest version of the game.Based on the quality of tech inside the Series X combined with the price point, I would have bought one even without backwards compatibility. But the fact that buying a Xbox also supports an ecosystem of game preservation is just icing on the cake.",

Controller somehow feels even more solid than the Xbox One.That said, DO NOT BUY FROM SCALPERS and just wait on more to be available.  Faster load times aren't worth another $300+ dollars and by purchasing from a scalper you're rewarding awful ""business"" practices.  Send a message with your wallet that this isn't acceptable.I won't dock stars for this because this review is for a console, but as an aside, Microsoft, Sony, and all the retailers should be ashamed for allowing their supply to be purchased by scalpers in this capacity to begin with, but unfortunately they do not care and are laughing all the way to the bank.

Xbox Series X,5.0,Great machine for your back catalogue too.,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on February 1, 2021",Style: Series X | Pattern Name: Xbox,False,"For those wondering why there's perpetual shortages of PS5/Series X, it's because the fabrication process for AMD Zen 2 CPU's are complex and slow going. AMD also supplies the chips for both console makers, and is stretched thin by the demand.For those who offer hollow comfort in the media by saying there's no exclusives for the Series X and without any new games it's not worth getting upset about. I disagree completely. Next gen consoles are the perfect time to play last gen titles on your back log. In fact, the Series X is the most perfect machine to finally get around to those games you wanted to play but felt they ran kinda janky and bad.Games like No Mans Sky, ran janky and bad. Games like Kingdom Hearts 3, ran janky and bad. Games where developers said 'F it, uncap the framerate and let it go free'. Those games, were janky and the load times were bad.There's so many back compat games that load in 1/5th the time, and hit 60FPS. Skyrim finally hits 60FPS on consoles with HDR/4k. You can scoff at how Skyrim is a PS3/360 game, but this is my point. Next gen consoles bring new life to your catalogue. New $60 AAA games with microtransactions and Games As A Service profit model isn't going to justify my purchase. Getting Blair Witch to actually hit 60FPS and avoid motion sickness justifies it.That makes waiting for these things to come into stock so painful. Because they're machines that do an amazing job looking backwards as well as forwards. Here's to hoping AMD ups their game.",3 people found this helpful

Xbox Series X,1.0,"Blatant Privacy Issues, Occasional Purchasing and Connectivity Issues","Reviewed in the United States on September 17, 2022",Style: Series X | Pattern Name: Xbox,False,"Recently I purchases the Xbox Series X through another online retailer. Upon turning on the system I was prompted to create a XBOX Live account by providing an email which is understandable especially if you plan to play online. After completing that process, I receive another prompt requesting an additional email address or phone number for verification purposes I had an issue with that but opted to provide an additional email address. Subsequent to that, Microsoft ""requires"" you to provide your home address even for purchases with a gift card and prompts you to use biometrics(optional) for added security and verification. I turned on the Xbox Series X after 3 days of no gaming and met with a prompt stating there's an issue with my account and that I had to use the web to fix it. I thought maybe the problem was account inactivity. I sign in online and met with a DECEPTIVE prompt from Microsoft to get additional personal information(phone number) stating the account was locked for suspicious activity and that my phone number was needed for verification purposes otherwise the account would remain locked.Apart from the blatant privacy issues, Microsoft minus the fact that XBOX doesn't have many exclusive games has an ""ocassional"" issue with purchases/downloads where the games your purchase either doesnt show in your download queue or the purchase is lost.

Xbox Series X,2.0,Don’t buy physical copies of games.,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on April 18, 2022",Style: Series X | Pattern Name: Xbox,False,"If you’re wondering why it doesn’t say I purchased this item while writing my review, I bought this console off of a seller on eBay in 2021 because I was impatient to get a fairly priced Xbox, since this would have been my first one. Little did I know this would be one of the purchases in my list of ""I wish I had done more research"". To start off, I live in a semi-rural area, where I don’t have the best internet. Why am I saying that I live in a rural area? Because every time I buy a physical copy of a game and put a disk in, I have to most of the time wait a whole day (or longer) to play the game I just bought because the Xbox, before you are able to play the game, requires a download to “optimize” the game for series X. I know the gimmick of this console is quick resume and some optimization for older games, but until after I bought it I had no knowledge whatsoever that I had to do this stupid download even for new titles. The most infuriating part is if a new game is available for Xbox Series X, the marketing team will most of the time still cater toward Series S/the Xbox one, and even if it says Xbox Series X on the game case, I still have to do a long download. I can sympathize an optimization of a newer game that wasn’t originally made for the Xbox Series X, solely to allow the game to access quick resume, but for psychical games that literally have “Made for Xbox Series X” on the game case, it makes absolute no sense I still have to do a long download to be able to play. I personally like collecting digital copies since there’s a charm to it, but for the Xbox Series X, it’s 100% better just to buy from the Microsoft store on the console. Regardless of the downloads there’s still a lot of good to come out of this console. The Xbox controller for the Series X is the perfect size, and is very responsive to imputs. Even though I hate doing the optimization downloads, I still enjoy the small graphical upgrades the Xbox Series X does to enhance the visuals of old games, and especially the relatively new ones too. While playing games on the console, the games ( at least to my eyes ) consistently run 60 fps and paired with my 4K HD TV, the games look stunning. In the end, there is some gripes I have with the console, since no console is perfect, but to be able to play some of my older games with more stable fps, a good controller, and new, visually stunning games, I am quite satisfied with the console.",

Could play additional games off my auxiliary HDD.4-The same 1 TB memory on the Series X only held 17 games and I could not play games off of my HDD.

These monitors can run these specs over hdmi 2.0, but don't conform to the standard VESA timings, which is all Microsoft uses. This limits many high end gaming monitors to 1080p 120hz, or 1440p 60hz, which is unfortunate.

Huh?The controller range is NO BETTER, so I can't put it into my dedicated media closet with its own sealed HVAC system to keep it cool and virtually eliminate dust.Additionally, even though this Series X is being played on the absolute latest and greatest home theater and professional audio equipment (trust me on this one), I can't tell a difference between it and my One X.Lastly, I had to buy the stupid 2TB SeaGate hard drive, even though I already had the previous 9 TB Seagate HD. Still, I couldn't tell a difference in load times, etc.All in, I'm at almost $1,000 for the ""privilege"" of owning Microsoft's newest junk, but it's actually worse than the previous One X in SO MANY WAYS. I've been an Xbox fanboy since the original (I'm old), but this one misses the mark severely. I REALLY wish I hadn't wasted my money on it",One person found this helpful

Xbox Series X,5.0,VALUE VALUE VALUE!!!,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on January 6, 2022",Style: Series X | Pattern Name: Xbox,False,"2022 summer update owned for 6 months.Should i really need to write this review? I hope not> i'm not going to write pros and cons. I'm just going to give you data. You decide.what is in this black box you see:- blueray player- 3700 cpu- 6700xt gpu- god tier optimizations- controller- zero sound- fantastic warranty- GAMES ARE CHEAP. You buy used. disk. Cyberpunk 7, witcher 10, RD2 18 just examples.- no heat.- you can buy 3 year warranty from msft for 30 bucks- gam pass is cheap and good.- premium psu500.I've had this for 6 months now. if you are still watiing for a gpu please give this a try let the gpus come back down they aren't worth it yet. I have a 1080ti and this thing. This looks better and plays faster than that. Your going to need even in summer 2022 about 600 for a gpu  to have any hope of competing with this in any significant way, and even then. i'd argue almost 3070/3080I tried the 3080 ventus 12gb. It was loud hot, and the games frankly didn't really look much better. It was maybe 5 percent on cyberpunk. You could barely tell it was like a little more smoke, some light flashing. I returned it and stuck with this. It wasn't worth 800 for the gpu. I'll wait there for prices to get 6 or under. Unless your totally against xbox or consoles this is the way to go. Even the control it's so good they kept it backwards compatible iwth a replaceable batter.THIS IS THE BEST TECH PURCHASE I'VE EVER MADE. Sony and Microsoft kept gaming accessible. yes suppy was hard for a while. hats off to them for being responsible though. buy this and have a great time. I did.original review------------------I had ancient consoles. The original Ps4/xbox one (got xbox one free from a garbage it was broken with a bad drive), and xbox 360. Going to be honest traditionally a pc gamer. but zero value.Main con. I wanted to start here because this is mainly a positive review. But i really don't think you deserve to have your hard earned money go to scalpers. Just wait. IMO neither of the main consoles are entirely worth all the freaking out at this point. yes they are better (mainly load time) and if you have 4k and want higher refresh you benefit there too, but neither have a ton of games that really are that next level. I noticed loading time differences, but to my eyes that's the main thing w/o more game support. Many developers aren't going to write games for these yet yeah because well they are hard to get. You can also wait and get improvements and minor tweaks they make as they discover issues in both. that takes 1-2 year often times or more.Update -- more games supported now --- still no sanity in gpu market. I feel this or ps5 is by far your best bet if you care about value.Other con  (specific to xbox) less exclusives. that said in my ps4 experience i never really enjoyed any of them. I play Witcher 3/2, cyberpunk, divinity, read dead redemption, skyrim cog (a very little) and games like that. So this was all academic to me. Xbox had more of what i wanted interms of specs, how it's built, and raw power, online presence. I personally think this time around it's the better console. I also prefer the backward compat controllers with replaceable batteries. i also go a 3 year warranty.This console fell into my lap so i got it. I paid 400 new, and bought the extra 3 year warranty for 30 dollars from MSFT (their complete plan like apple care). I recommend you not spend more than 500, buy from a good retailer like amazon or msft store, and then consider the warranty.  Guess where i work. I got it for a discount new from the msft store :) I also want to be upfront about that. But i like the product, and i wanted to share these thoughts. I only paid for the ps4 last gen.Pros- looks to me better than the ps5. I love that you can place it reasonably vertical or horizontal (i still prefer horizontal due to reduced tipping chances)- same controllers with replaceable batteries. this was and continues to be my preference.- most power vs competition /long term-- mainly academic now. I know the loading  time gets press in psf, but the raw power of the series x will win out over time as games actually are written to take advantage of it. it's a better GPU and CPU, and this is exactly why i bought the ps4 last time it intern was cheaper and better than the original xbox one.- can be had at a reasonable cost esp vs video cards if you need a new device- will last for many years at this point in the cycle.- i personally like that it handles vertical and horizontal particularly well.- great loading times- repairability. In the previous version ps4 was better, now it's tilted to xbox again here too. the internal ssd can be replaced (the built in one). not the case with ps5. They soldered that. It's not academic it's how i fixed a broken xbox before.  Cooling is good on both. I think it's safe to assume you'll be able to use ps5 for xbox series x for 10 years, i mean i'm still using my 360, so i plan to here as well.-value : frankly if you just pay msrp the consoles are of particular value. PC gaming is too volatile and expensive. you are early in the generation. i should have bought my ps4 earlier, but for that i paid 150 on a target sale when they were dumping some originals, but for this in exchange i waited 70% into the generation on my 360. I say if you can get one of these a little earlier first 1/3 of the generation it makes more sense.- storage expand: The cartages are more expensive on extensive storage, but you can already get cheap replacements /adapters with nvme on Chinese sites. In addition, it's not much more costly than say a samsung pro etc which is required for PS5 anyway.  When you want you can simply just swap in new drives to your hearts content. it's not that bad a of a system to be completely honest. 360 had something like this.- you can get the extended warranty for 3 years from Microsoft (Microsoft complete for 30 dollars). I think that is well worth it. there are a lot of parts and things that can go wrong.- i like the online service for xbox better than sony and the backward compat library eg wticher 2- i like the mod story better on xbox, for games. they are simply less restrictive. though sony has lighted up on that.- boot times is fast.- zero crashes or bugs so far.Some attributes and their thoughts.Multi player/online: vs pc i don't like the multi player experience for either console (it's expensive if you have kids and you want to play with them) however i'm pretty much done with pc gaming with these gpu prices, volatility and all the dramma there. Think about it it's been going on now for many years. If someone had told me people would be destroying the environment for mining fake money 15 years ago i'd not have believed them. if i ever hear the term mining again it will be too soon. For now we are fairly insulated from that crap so i'm getting off that ship, get on this  gen early and just ignoring pc gaming.value: You can't go wrong with either playstation or xbox at retail price. For me xbox was available and the power and repairability and the online gameplass stuff put it well in favor for me this time. i'm not really aligned with either like i say i was more aligned to ps4 last time for much of the same reasons. It was more powerful and i wasn't purchasing a kinect i didn't need.os: After using this device i appreciated several things about xbox beyond the clear performance and quality. Most of the internals are premium. The operating system is less bugging. Apps just close when you are trying to exit a game and get to streaming services, though i find the interface in sony a bit more intuitive, i don't find this one hard to use, and of course that personal. Xbox does seem to actually work better though. Many times in ps4 id be playing red dead or some game like this and have to attempt to open prime vieo like 10 times. It's been an issue for years, unless you manually kill the previous app.sound: Another nice thing about the series x is how quiet it is. They use one massive fan that hardly needs to spin to cool the device.Backwards compat:  The controllers feel great to me before and they still do. Though i like the playstation controllers to be honest as well. As i said having battery packs that are easily changeable is awesome on xbox. Everything is backwards so you can use old ones. I've not felt like i've missed  by staying the course there.Repairability:Power supply: i wish it was still external. That's usually the failure point of either of these devices. not always but usually. you can buy them online, but it was nice to buy new psus for the xbox 360 /one in the original after 10 years or so when they fail.Drives: the drivers can fail and require desoldering a board. It continues to be annoyingAll the storage can be replaced. Trust me i've had to do this as i said. Everything fails with time. not soldering everything to a mother board is just good sense.It's about 100 and something but i recall you can get most things on these xboxes repaired from msft. That's also nice.cleaning: i don't love the cleaning story. it's really hard to get to any of the heat sinks. I 've got 2 dogs, and a gsd. it'll be interesting as the years go on what the cleaning experience is like.",2 people found this helpful

Xbox Series X,2.0,XBox Series X - ALREADY SENT FOR REPAIR,"Reviewed in the United States on September 26, 2021",Style: Series X | Pattern Name: Xbox,True,"I decided to “bite the bullet” and pay double for the XBox Series X compared to the retail price in stores. I was a little wary of paying this much (close to $900) and doing so from a third-party, but I just really wanted to experience the next generation of gaming.Everything seemed to be alright when I opened the box. I followed all instructions to set up my XBox and soon enough I was ready to play. I began playing an online game and a couple of minutes into the match my XBox began lagging. Then, my XBox started making a loud rattling type noise and abruptly shut all the way off (perhaps to protect itself?). The controller light was left blinking and not responding. I had a terrible, sick feeling, but I decided to try again. Maybe my internet connection was bad or something? Soon after restarting the system, I began playing again. I checked the connection first and had full signal strength, so it couldn’t be that. I started the same game over again and the same exact thing happened again. I tried a game on a disc next and the same problem occurred. Desperate to play some games, I put up with this nonsense for a couple of days. There were some times where I got in some solid gaming, but the system would always eventually lag, rattle, and shut off. Finally, I reached my mental limit and decided to call XBox. I sent my Series X in to be repaired because thankfully it was still under warranty.I am not going to get on here and berate anyone. I am just extremely disappointed in the whole situation occurring in gaming today: scarcity of consoles, outrageous pricing, etc.My goal I’m writing this is to hopefully make others think twice before giving in and paying way too much for a potentially faulty product.If I could go back and do it over again, I would not make this purchase. I would wait patiently to find a console in the stores for retail price. I cannot help but feel cheated.",8 people found this helpful
Xbox Series X,5.0,The hype is all true,"Reviewed in the United States on May 15, 2022",Style: Series X | Pattern Name: Xbox,True,"I've been PC gamer the bulk of my life, but with graphic cards being insanely priced the last few years, I've decided to go the less expensive route and upgrade my Xbox 360 (which still works perfectly, never had an issue).  Granted, I'm not saying this thing is great because my last system is approaching 15 years old.  This thing is great because of all the small things it allows.  Switching between games is super quick (excluding physical disc changing, that is subjective), loading up Prime Video or HBOMax is seemingly faster than my PC, and you can organize your screens (add/remove stuff, change priorities)The controller is familiar, feels less heavy, and super comfortable.So far the only negative experience is one game I'd been looking forward to playing doesn't work.  Few years back I saw there was a game that allowed you to use He-Man as your avatar, small, lesser known game called Toy Soldiers: War chest edition.  As I understand the game has had issue almost since launch, so not blaming the Series X, I was just hopeful.Anyway, game run smoothly, the fast switching feature is super cool, and if you can afford it Game Pass Ultimate will keep you loaded with more games than you can finish in that month.If you are like me and occasionally playing on older console, it's time my friend, just do it.",

This is true if you don't have a 4k TV.  If your running 1080p - 1440p - keep the Series S.  Using this on a 4k TV is night a day. The sound seems to be much richer as well.  IF you can get it at normal retail price (499.99) - buy it.  Dont spend a PENNY more!This is far and away the best bang for your buck when It comes to gaming.  Try to put together a PC with these stats.  The video card alone will cost more than the Xbox Series X.PS5 looks like a child's toy compared to this beast.",

Fan was running, and the console didn’t seem to be too hot.It went on to shut off around 8 more times within an hour span.

This is a very good way of getting rid of the resellers and scalpers!  I hope Amazon starts doing this with other high demand items as well.I got this during the October 17, 2022 invite.  In less than 5 days I had this in my hands.  Xbox was shipped in a larger outer box, BUT...........there was no padding or protection!  Luckily, box arrived unscathed.Set-up is like any other Xbox.  This one replaced my old Xbox One.  As soon as I hooked it all up, I downloaded the new Modern Warfare 2 game.  I left the Xbox on overnight and by next morning I was all set to play.  Everything ran as expected!  No problems whatsoever with the set-up and gaming experience.  All-in-all, I am very happy and fortunate to be able to get this, esp. since everyone else is out of stock.  Thank you very much Amazon!!",2 people found this helpful

If you have an Xbox one you will love this console. If you are like me you may need to buy new games in a different environment.

Xbox Series X,3.0,Just ok,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on September 9, 2022",Style: Series X | Pattern Name: Xbox,True,"It's not bad but I guess I was expecting more. Like faster dl times. In a side by side test with my xbox one cutscene and game load time where pretty close with the series x. The x being just a little faster. Like maybe a second.The controller is a joke the layout is fine but the response is ludicrous having to jam buttons just to get it to respond unfortunately that is no where good enough for any online play.Not sure if it is just the one I received or this is a known issue. My 1x controller is fantastic with one of the best response times I have ever had.My 1x cost about the same as the series x so it is a small upgrade VERY SMALL.Do I recommend it sure if u have the money and u like xbox why not.But if u have a 1x and are looking to ""upgrade"" I'm not sure this is for u. I despise sony but the ps5 is faster I think it does not seem as if it's quite as bogged down with down load issues.I have a gigabit fiber internet. The fastest I have ever gotten on my 1x is about 230mbps and dl a new game was well a joke. With the series x dl will start at around 500mbps and then I can watch as it counts down to about 120mbps if I run an internet speed test through the series x it says my speed is around 920 to 940 then I can go back to dl screen and see the speed bumps back up around 500mbps only to watch it drop back to about 150mbps or so. This is a known issue with Microsoft xbox and has been for years and years. It's been documented all over the internet just look it up.So again it's not bad if u have the money and in need of an xbox then get it. The graphics are nice but it feels like there are few games actually made for series x just a lot of upgraded one x games.Not sure what happened of the last 5 or 6 years but Microsoft has definitely dropped the ball on that one.",

Xbox Series X,5.0,Amazing…Nuf said!,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on August 3, 2022",Style: Series X | Pattern Name: Xbox,True,I’ve played video games before video games were cool. I was a first grade champion when it came to the Oregon Trail on the classroom Commodore 64. Now to this machine…wow! I upgraded from One X and what a difference. I also happened to be lucky enough to have Amazon invite me to purchase. The one star reviews shouldn’t be allowed as they are on the 3P sellers who have the systems marked up. Be patient and you’ll get one. It’s not like Microsoft will launch another console next year…or will they?!,One person found this helpful

Xbox Series X,5.0,Thank you Amazon Invitation,"Reviewed in the United States on October 14, 2022",Style: Series X | Pattern Name: Xbox,True,"Even after 2 years, finding the Xbox X at regular price is difficult. Thankfully, Amazon began offering invitations to purchase a single unit at the MSRP of $499. Sign up and receive an invitation when your order can be fulfilled. You have 72 hours after notification to purchase the unit. Then simply order and pay as any other Amazon purchase.The Xbox X has several advantages over the Xbox one. The first thing you notice is the quiet. The loud fans of the past are gone. The large tower look may or may not be your thing. But it runs quiet and smooth. I noticed a better viewing quality on older games. Skyrim looks better than ever on the new console. The gamers out there will love the new Xbox.",10 people found this helpful

Of course, they’re still sold out all over the place, so I knew I’d have to pay a little more on Amazon in order to get one.

I received a launch day unit which worked for three days and apparently died overnight.  No obvious reason for the death of the system but it simply won't turn on again.  MS support is sadly poor - just a circular loop back to the same canned and deficient ""support"" page, and an option to request a repair on the unit.  Says there's 24 hour online support, but I can't actually get it for this issue.  Likely returning it instead of requesting a repair.Prior to the hardware failure I was happy with the system.
