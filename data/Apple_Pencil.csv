Apple Pencil (2nd Generation),5.0,Should all tablets have one?,"Reviewed in the United States on March 28, 2023",,True,"The stylus seems to be a feature fewer and fewer tablets have these days. I do like the improved accuracy you get vs your finger, especially when you move from mobile optimized sites to desktop ones. And yes desktop view looks better on a big screen, so I say the answer is yes, all tablets should have a proper stylus.The Apple Pencil Mk2 does pair and charge easily via magnetic snapping. Note the iPad does not have a housing for the pencil, I recommend getting a third party case/cover that does. Even though it is magnetic doesn‚Äôt mean it can‚Äôt come loose and be lost and this accessory is not cheap. The flat, touch sensitive interface feels awkward and I don‚Äôt think Apple has fully realized its usage. The more tactile ‚Äúvolume dial‚Äù of a Wacom (or similar) stylus is better for implementing controls and switches when painting/drawing‚Ä¶but such discussion is of scope considering we are talking about an iPad accessory, and this isn‚Äôt a review of the iPad drawing experience.",22 people found this helpful
Apple Pencil (2nd Generation),5.0,READ BEFORE BUYING OFF AMAZON WAREHOUSE,"Reviewed in the United States on April 10, 2023",,True,"TL;DR. Have serious caution when buying off of Amazon Warehouse.I originally purchased this 2nd gen Apple Pencil for a discounted rate off of the Amazon warehouse. It was supposed to be a 2 day delivery, ended up being 6. Fine, no big deal, I saved money. The package shows up in original packaging AND THERE WAS NO PENCIL. None. I paid $80 for a box. I could not contact Amazon about the order or leave a review, so I requested a refund.I ended up buying the pencil for full price. And it works great! Definitely recommend it.",13 people found this helpful
Apple Pencil (2nd Generation),5.0,Works like a charm,"Reviewed in the United States on April 2, 2023",,True,Really nice pencil/stylus from Apple. Genuine Apple pencil 2. I got it for a backup to my other Apple pencil 2 for when the battery gets low after using it for hours. It works perfectly. Now I can switch out pencils and not have to wait for one to recharge before resuming drawing. NOTE: A big issue is that you can't charge one pencil on the iPad while using the other one. It's only one pencil per iPad at a time. So you have to charge the other pencil on a different iPad. This is something Apple needs to change.,8 people found this helpful
Apple Pencil (2nd Generation),5.0,Most efficient for apple,"Reviewed in the United States on March 28, 2023",,True,"I bought it for my iPad about two months ago and it is the best combination, being in the apple eco-system it is highly compatible with it, however, it doesn't work with the other devices if you were curious. The magnetic hold is strong and doesn't fall off easily, and the touch has never been an issue, I have not explicitly tried but I have never run out of battery, and being a student I use the pencil for 3 hours straight twice or even thrice a day without any charging issues. Finally, the only real issue is that you'll need to download and might even have to pay for the right apps to get the best out of it.",17 people found this helpful

Apple Pencil (2nd Generation),4.0,Great to use but there are issues,"Reviewed in the United States on March 17, 2023",,True,"The pencil when it connects to the iPad works great. But there are bugs maybe to the iPad os or to the pencil itself that makes it disconnect to the iPad and no matter what it doesn‚Äôt connect back. Happened to me and I hit forget device, reconnected, and it worked. Happened again after a month, so I hit forget this device and it was gone. Tried everything but nothing worked. Thankfully Amazon still took it back after the 30 days were up. Mind you the pencil was but 4 months in use and hadn‚Äôt been damaged in the slightest. I also heard if taken to the Apple Store they will usually take the broken one back and get you another one (probably done within the one year manufacture warranty).",35 people found this helpful

But it keeps thinking I'm tapping it so it changes tips when i don't want it to change. So, I made a thin sleeve out of fabric, 1-2 thicknesses. I hold it together with 3 thin strips of tape. (cut the fabric to size, wrap around the pencil and hold tight, and tape.) Now I can still tap to change tips but it doesn't change on its own very much any more.

I can see where the pencil is convenient for artists but at the same time, the sleekness of the screen seems that it would be difficult to draw on.

Apple Pencil (2nd Generation),5.0,This thing changed the game for my iPad art and design,"Reviewed in the United States on December 21, 2022",,True,"I previously had an iPad Air 2 and used an Adonit pixel since the air is not compatible with the Apple Pencil. It didn‚Äôt work that well but it did what I needed with some bugs and jitters. I finally upgraded to the 2021 iPad Pro 11 inch and I got the Apple Pencil 2 when it went on sale. I have been SO impressed with this thing. I love the way it writes and draws it feels like I‚Äôm writing on paper and the smoothness of the line is stellar. It completely changed the game for me when I work on my art and design. I use procreate and they have many updated features that include options for the Apple Pencil so the integration with all of the apps I already use is phenomenal. I think the sale price I paid for 89.99 is more than reasonable but I couldn‚Äôt see myself paying full price for this even with how impressive it is. But at the sale price I am more than satisfied.The only thing that I don‚Äôt like is the magnetic feature that is supposed to keep it on the iPad and is how it charges. I have put the iPad in my backpack with the pencil attached and then when I pull it out the pencil wasn‚Äôt attached anymore. I of course had a small panic but then found it in the bottom of my bag so no but deal. I just wish it had some other mechanism that kept the pencil more secured, but I will say the fact that I don‚Äôt have to plug it in to anything to charge it is definitely convenient.",56 people found this helpful

Yes, it's very pricey but I personally think it works better than a cheap stylus would. I find that Apple‚Äôs products usually always work smoothly together and if you‚Äôre planning to use it for digital drawings, then I would advise purchasing one. I just feel like there wouldn‚Äôt be another pencil out there that would write as smooth AND have these type of features together AND work as seamlessly with the iPad. I LOVE that it connects to the side of the iPad and charges that way too (I‚Äôm terrible about missplacing and losing things lolz).The main feature I love is the double tap to switch between the writing tool to the eraser. I just feel like it saves me from the hassle & frustration of having to go back & forth (My OCD=A lot of erasing lolz).

Apple Pencil (2nd Generation),5.0,A must-have if you use an iPad for notes,"Reviewed in the United States on December 14, 2022",,True,"I decided to buy myself an iPad Air 4 for my birthday in 2019 because I was returning to school. Getting the Apple Pencil with it was a game changer.I'm in my 30s and I am a person who loves physical books and writing on paper. I was hesitant to buy an iPad for notes, but after watching classmates use them and asking them questions, it seemed like it would be really beneficial.I bought a paperlike screen protector, and I love using my apple pencil for writing! It has gotten to the point where I am double tapping on actual pencils because I have just become completely assimilated to writing on an iPad. It is very intuitive and has a variety of uses.I never had the 1st gen apple pencil, but I love the magnetic charging and double tap so I do think the 2nd generation is worth the extra price.I bought a 6-pack of tips in 2019 and I still have plenty left even though I write on my iPad regularly.My ONLY gripe is that the pencils are so specific to different models. My son has the 2020 iPad and my pencil won't work on his iPad because it isn't a Pro or Air model. It would be nice if Apple was able to make an update that allowed the different pencils to be compatible on all models.",50 people found this helpful

I search up how to connect it just to realize.. it only connects to ipad 10 and above, devastated and laughing out of disappointment and my stupidity I look for ways to return it and well, now the only way to return is to go to amazon itself which is very far from me so I paid the 6 dollars for them to come pick it up and in around a week I got my money back, I can't say much about the product apart from the fact that it was nicely packed and it‚Äôs quite pretty pen.

Under Settings on the iPad there is a Pencil section. I suggest going there to try out some of the features of the Apple Pencil. It writes very smoothly on the screen. I do recommend placing a screen protector on your iPad (as well as your iPhone) for general purpose protection. It felt good in my hand, sort of like one of those pencils we used in First Grade. I have large hands, so someone with small hands might need an optional Pencil Grip. I found the accuracy of the Apple Pencil to be spot on.

Apple Pencil (2nd Generation),5.0,The Fountain pencil of IPads,"Reviewed in the United States on July 11, 2021",,True,"I wanted to give this a 4 star only due to the price but even for the price it really is worth it. For me, I‚Äôm big on writing with fountain pens and I was expecting this to be a bit bulky but when I got it in person and using it the Apple Pencil is quite slim and has a long thin barrel design. It is very very comfortable to use and is quite light. I enjoyed that it paired with my iPad Pro (12.9 M1 model) instantly and brought up the scribble setting to give you a nice straight forward tutorial. That was awesome and after a couple of minutes it really becomes quite second nature and an extension of your pointer finger so using it to navigate around IPad is pretty nice. I was using it in VLC to adjust brightness, volume, etc and then I been using this every day for writing practice and daily planning and I am using a glass screen protector and it really just glides across the glass just like when I would use my fountain pens on paper and I love that. The pressure sensitivity is definitely impressive. I use both normal scripture and caligraphic scripture and it handles those strokes with ease and is quite enjoyable. The battery is also very very nice. I can write for over 45 minutes without losing any battery life from full charge and with the pencil cover I went for makes for quite the nice addition to my Logitech combo touch case. I wasn‚Äôt sure how to feel at first with spending nearly 130 dollars for this but with how fast Amazon delivered it and I could just use it right out of the box I definitely say this is worth it and continues to be if you are an artist. I drew an astronaut in procreate and the double tap feature to go through my recent tools, color palettes, etc make this just an easy process for productivity and flow. I really didn‚Äôt expect this but having it is definitely worth it. My only gripes are the price and that it is not included in the price of the IPad Pros because even if you‚Äôre like me and primarily use your ipad for media consumption it‚Äôs still a very useful accessory to have in the multitude of accessories you will inevitably buy with the IPad. Considering how often it feels to naturally use this pencil it is very worth the money for the investment. Highly highly recommend this device.",16 people found this helpful

If you've held Pencil 1, you probably understand what I mean, as smooth as Apple Pen 1 is, then Apple Pen 2 feels more confident, even a small improvement makes a lot of difference.

The problem is a lot of times I will be writing something like an Acronym and it will insist on spell correcting it, or I will attempt to write a period and get a comma. I then end up pulling the keyboard out to fix it, because I get frustrated with the pencil after a few attempts. I would also like to see more gestures, like one to make a new line, etc. Don't even try to write a URL with it. that will be an exercise in futility.I hope there are improvements to the writing software because it feels like it could have a lot of potential, but ends up causing frustration.",18 people found this helpful

Apple Pencil (2nd Generation),4.0,Works well and what not.,"Reviewed in the United States on June 5, 2022",,True,"Works like I expected it to. I got it for drawing, digital journaling, and some basic stylus stuff. It serves its purpose well. It‚Äôs heavy in a good way and I like the material it‚Äôs made of. It takes a sec to get used to but once you‚Äôve got the hang of it it‚Äôs really comfortable.Only problem I have is that I - think - it may be used. I didn‚Äôt inspect it much when I got it because it looked fine and I‚Äôd ordered it new. I had to look at it more up close when I got a cover for it and noticed a really tiny scuff on the top of it. I hadn‚Äôt dropped it at any point ( I use my iPad on my bed only and am extremely careful ) so I don‚Äôt know what happened there. Maybe it was just dropped during packaging idk.I also watched it‚Äôs battery drop 4% within the span of maybe .5s while it wasn‚Äôt in use. Not sure if that was a problem with the battery health indicator on my iPad or the pencil. It does seem to drain sorta fast but not always. When I got suspicious of it I ran a stopwatch ( for 36 hours by accident. Meant to do 24. Oops ) and the battery wasn‚Äôt too bad then. I wanted to return it but I‚Äôm conflicted AF because outside of that it works fine and I don‚Äôt feel like shipping it back nor waiting for a new one to reach me. Guess I‚Äôll just be expecting to purchase another if this one dies.Overall, I think the Apple Pencil 2 is dope and I would recommend getting it if you want to draw or write. Is it worth purchasing as a random stylus when you only watch Youtube and play games ? Eh. I did find myself reaching for it when I was playing SDV, but if I didn‚Äôt need it for the other things I wouldn‚Äôt even think to purchase it. Cost too damn much.",117 people found this helpful

Apple Pencil (2nd Generation),5.0,Pretty good. For $120 I'm not impressed tho.,"Reviewed in the United States üá∫üá∏ on August 24, 2022",,True,"It's fantastic instrument with a couple of flaws.1. It needs to be charged.2. It's too heavy and it's rear balanced.Okay, I don't actually mind having to charge it, it's easy enough that it doesn't impact me much. I do hope that Apple pencil 3 or 4 loses the battery though. If only to reduce the weight...Which is the bigger issue for me. It weighs a pretty substantial .73 oz.Doesn't sound like much does it?For comparison a normal pencil weighs between .2 and .3 oz.Most pens weigh between .3 and .5 oz.It's even heavier than some half inch thick markers, while still being only slightly thicker than a pencil. Which for many will mean they will want to add a grip. Even further increasing the weight.Combine that with the fact it is balanced more towards the eraser than the tip, and well... it's a bit awkward.Will it bother you though?Probably not, most people don't mind. Some people don't even notice.If your an artist though, especially one used to regularly weighted styluses or wood pencils, charcoal. Or anything else under .4 oz.Then yeah you will probably notice. And you probably won't like it at first.Anyways...Overall I still like it. It isn't so heavy that you can't use it. And all the positives of it are still nice. But remember AP3 is probably coming out soon. You may want to wait and see if it's an improvement.",61 people found this helpful

Apple Pencil (2nd Generation),5.0,Amazon Warehouse Purchase (Artist),"Reviewed in the United States üá∫üá∏ on July 22, 2020",,True,"The Apple Pencil is great and is my favorite way to draw digitally. The Apple Pencil 2 has a nice satin/matte finish, a nice change from the previous gloss finish. Wireless charging is one of the biggest changes and might be the only flimsy reason to upgrade from the previous version, because you have to also upgrade your iPad to use the Apple Pencil 2.Extra:I just happened to get the opportunity to upgrade from the first generation Apple Pencil and iPad and it‚Äôs nice. Worth the upgrade? I don‚Äôt really think so. If I didn‚Äôt have the chance to sell my old set and get a little help to upgrade I wouldn‚Äôt have (the wireless charging and magnetic feature is so nice though üòÜ).Bought this from the Amazon Warehouse for a hundred bucks, listed as like new with slight damage to packaging. Also upgraded to the new iPad Pro through Amazon (brand spankin‚Äô new). First time buying something in this price range on here so I was pretty anxious.I pushed through the anxiety and clung onto the belief that if you read the descriptions carefully and do your research you get exactly what you want. Had ordered enough from Amazon to know packages from the U.S. get to me one hundred percent of the time. I weighed everything I could think of in my head then decided.It works perfectly, everything is ‚Äúlike new‚Äù No damage to the actual item. I normally don‚Äôt like buying previously opened items cause I like the ‚ÄúNew, fresh, this is mine, I opened you first‚Äù feeling, but I didn‚Äôt want to shell out the twenty-something extra than what the first generation Apple Pencil cost.Extra Part II:I dove into the Apple drawing set up cause I thought it was a good alternative to a Cintiq at the time. I love the portability and precision of the iPad and pencil just a great over all drawing experience after putting on a matte screen protector of course. File support and apps will only get better, don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll ever change from this digital drawing set up. It‚Äôs just like picking up a digital sketchbook, it goes anywhere an analog sketchbook and pencil can.There‚Äôs so many options for digital display drawing tables now, compared to when the first generation Apple Pencil came out. Weigh your options and do your research, the Apple Pencil may not be for you. (Wow I really overthought this review üòÖ)",24 people found this helpful
Apple Pencil (2nd Generation),5.0,Pretty Nifty,"Reviewed in the United States üá∫üá∏ on November 26, 2022",,True,"Grabbed this at the current sale price of $90. Much better deal than buying from Apple directly right now.It connected seamlessly with my iPad Pro 12.9‚Äù and charges as expected.It will take me some time to get used to using it(I haven‚Äôt used a stylus on a regular basis before with an iPad. Ihave, however, used a Wacom tablet for years)and I will most likely end up buying a ‚Äúpaper feel‚Äù screen protector, because I am skipping all over my tempered glass one with it. And I‚Äôll also probably end up getting one of those silicone grips to slide over the lower portion, because I find its shape a little uncomfortable to grip for extended lengths of time.Despite my minor quibbles, which are all on me, I am very happy with this stylus and love how it helps me with my productivity.",44 people found this helpful

Apple Pencil (2nd Generation),5.0,Great tool,"Reviewed in the United States on October 9, 2022",,True,I was bummed I had to buy a new apple pencil since the one I have works just fine. Unfortunately it does not work with the new iPads and I needed to upgrade mine. I do really like that it charges by magnetic... I dunno how it works ...but it attaches magnetically to the ipad to charge. It's surprisingly handy! The old one you had to charge by plugging it into the ipad and it was a pain because you could not charge the ipad at the same time. Also I was always afraid to lose the little cap. So... even though I really did not want to upgrade I am glad that I got the new one. It is indeed better. It seems to function the same as the old pencil as far as drawing with it.

The fact that this pencil + ipad that I have (which in total was like $700 in total) is almost as good as a $2000 wacom tablet is irritating and it's making me into an apple fan girl.  Next off the grip.  It's a pencil.  It feels like a heavy pencil, and I had no idea that I needed this in my life for quick sketches.  Not to mention it's so smooth but somehow has a slight grip to it, so it's not going to go sliding out of your hands, and it somehow just feels amazing to hold.  Oh and it's supposed to hang on the side of the ipad.  Probably just keeps it there but any heavy/sharp movements will take this thing off, right?  No, heck no.  This thing is more secure than my bank account password.  I want to hate it, I really really do.  I've disliked Apple practices for so long, but it's just so good that I can't.

Apple Pencil (2nd Generation),4.0,Worthy of the upgrade from Apple Pencil 2,"Reviewed in the United States on June 1, 2020",,True,"The Good:-Pairs instantly with IPad 11 Pro-Easy charging on side of IPad-Comfortable to hold-Writes flawlessly-Good balanceThe Bad:-A bit expensiveThe Bottom Line:I use my Apple Pencil 2 everyday as I take notes with my IPad Pro 11. The Apple Pencil 2 is a definite upgrade to the Apple Pencil 1 almost just because you can charge the pencil by attaching it to your IPad. This feature alone makes the Apple Pencil worth buying. The Apple Pencil 2 also has no lag and write flawlessly. It is very comfortable to hold. The only downside is the pencil is a bit expensive but that‚Äôs common for most Apple products. Overall, I would recommend the Apple Pencil 2 if you have a new version of the IPad Pro.","2,591 people found this helpful"

Apple Pencil (2nd Generation),5.0,Opens a new world of interaction on iPad,"Reviewed in the United States on April 21, 2021",,True,"I love this thing. If you have the right hardware for it (I have a 2020 iPad Air) then this will open up a whole new world of iPad use to you. I always drew on paper and never enjoyed art on tablets. Now I can draw on my iPad and it feels as natural as drawing on paper. And because the web is now the same size as it is on regular computers now, it can sometimes be hard to hit small links on web pages. The Apple Pencil lets me more easily navigate around web pages and hit those tiny boxes to close ads.I find myself using the pencil instead of my finger for almost everything on the iPad now. Being able to write directly in text boxes in any app is awesome. It takes about a day for the iPad to learn your handwriting and get what you're writing correct on the first try but once it learns your handwriting the Scribble feature works great.Of course there are times when using the keyboard or just navigating with your fingers is more natural but it's always great to have this pencil for art and for casual use as well. It's an accessory I thought I would only use for drawing but I use it more and more for just about everything now. The fact that it never runs out of battery and magnetically attaches to the side of my iPad makes it so I never have to remember to bring it with me because it's just a part of the iPad now.I would recommend this to anyone. It's not just for artists.",15 people found this helpful
Apple Pencil (2nd Generation),5.0,Finally got my Apple Pencil after the iPad Pro! worth the extra wait,"Reviewed in the United States on April 12, 2020",,True,"So I've had the IPad Pro 11"" and Apple Pencil 2 since March, honestly, I've only had good experiences. The new IPad Pro  makes the old one's bezels look ugly and thick. I haven't had any bending issues and I keep my iPads in cases anyway as they end up in my bag with tonnes of other crap that could scratch it.The Apple Pencil 2 really brings the IPad Pro out of it's shell though! The wireless charging is a godsend, no more silly 'Pencil dagger', and it gives the case-less among us the ability to keep the Pencil attached without needing a case! I've read issues of metal dust sticking to the magnet part of the Pencil 2, but I haven't experienced this personally!I used mine, on average, an hour a day I'd say? Still no issues in the few months months I've had it, I prefer the matte texture over the shiny plastic of the old Pencil.The Pencil 2 also has the 'Double tap' feature on the flat side, which is incredibly useful if you're an artist, I use this a lot in Procreate to switch between brushes and my eraser, but also works in Affinity Designer etc!UPDATE:I have used this item for a few weeks now and I can affirm that there is no better stylus sold by any manufacturer. The input is smooth, there is virtually no lag compared to other stylus. The 9ms response time absolutely destroyed the 20ms response time on the surface pro I had. And the gripe I still had for the Apple Pencil is that the tip is fragile and can get cracked when you drop it. And the other one, is these are just so EXPENSIVE. If you have a tight budget I'd recommend you getting it during school opening or some sort of discount.This is a great product, though I'd suggest the pen to be longer and less pricier. I would definitely recommend this to my friends and family.",31 people found this helpful

Apple Pencil (2nd Generation),1.0,Amazon sold me a used one!,"Reviewed in the United States on October 3, 2022",,True,"I ordered this Apple Pencil in anticipation for my new IPad Air 4 back in March 2021. It was marked as ‚Äúnew‚Äù, I paid full price ($130). It worked fantastically for most of the next 17 months. When the pencil was not in my hand, it was attached to the side of my iPad Air 4. It kept a 100% charge all the time when I wasn‚Äôt using it. I draw in Procreate, Illustrator, and Photoshop and I am an avid note taker so I‚Äôm always aware of the battery level of both devices.I always plugged my iPad in every night to charge or at my desk first thing in the morning while I worked. I always checked the Pencil. If it was ever detached for whatever reason, I connected it and observed it was at or near 100% every time. A few minutes later it was back to a full charge.Fast forward to August 2022.  The Apple Pencil suddenly stopped charging. Over the next few days, it failed to charge and died for the first time. It would intermittently charge. Every few days, it appeared to charge to 100% and seemed to be fine. A few days of sporadic use I would notice the Apple Pencil was not charging (I still kept the Pencil attached and the iPad charged). Then magically it would charge again after forgetting the Pencil and reconnecting several times. Then it would sporadically not maintain a charge.I was busy with a lot of important projects during this time so this was low priority in my life. Finally at the last week of September it refused to charge at all. It would charge enough to connect via Bluetooth (only briefly) then disconnect.I took it and my iPad to the local Best Buy (an Apple Authorized Service Provider) and they diagnosed it with a bad battery that would not charge. The tech asked me when I purchased the Pencil and I indicated ‚ÄúMarch 2021‚Äù so he was checking for any warranty that may be active. He checked the Serial Number against an Apple database and told me it was originally purchased in January 2021.I bought a new Pencil and got a used Pencil? It seemed to work fine for over a year. But I‚Äôm left wondering why it suddenly stopped charging? What could‚Äôve been wrong with it to have the Pencil last for so long then stop working? Are Apple Pencils notorious for just not being a good product?Granted, I had the device for one year and a number of months but I did not expect it to crap out on me so quickly. I have a 15 year old Wacom stylus and tablet that still work. I have an iPhone 6S Max that still works (not my daily driver, but still). My 37 year old NES works like it‚Äôs 1985. I take great care of my technology.I took care of it and followed the directions (especially didn‚Äôt get it wet or feed it after midnight). I took it on vacation this summer and it stayed in the room. Not even around water or sand. Yet here was a $130 aluminum and plastic stick that was useless. Like a fool, I did not purchase an Apple Care plan for the Pencil (my mistake). And it was apparently used when I bought it. Amazon lied.I spent $130 on another one at Best Buy that day (much to the chagrin from my wife) and I shouldn‚Äôt have had to do that. I could see if I treated it poorly and did not keep it charged but that was not the case.Amazon sold me a used Pencil that may have had a defect. I double checked my order to make sure I did not buy a refurbished or used Pencil (I did not). And since it worked for almost 18 months‚Ä¶probably nothing I can do.",31 people found this helpful

So since the $80 Used pencil didn't work, I went ahead & bought the $100 one. Overnight shipping is great, which is the only upside to this entire experience because the ""new"" one was broken as well!!!!! First of all, I think they sent me a USED PENCIL IN A NEW BOX!!!

Charged to 100%, connects to the iPad, tap gestures work, made sure the tip was tight, bluetooth was on, restarted the iPad‚Äî NOTHING. I was starting to think my iPad was the defective one! I ended up buying a $30 knockoff and it works PERFECTLY. Maybe next paycheque, i'll walk into Apple & get the real pencil (the knockoff doesn't have pressure sensitivity & i WAS using iPad to draw) but right now i'm just grateful to the knockoff.

Apple Pencil (2nd Generation),5.0,Worth. Every. Penny.,"Reviewed in the United States üá∫üá∏ on January 20, 2021",,True,"Not that Apple needs another great review on this but I was quite honestly dumbstruck by how well it works. As a heavy Wacom Intuos user, as well as several of their older models, I‚Äôve been using a drawing tablet & stylus for a long time (15+ years) & thought it‚Äôd be about the same experience, but I was dead wrong. The Apple Pencil is WAY more pressure sensitive & you can be a lot more precise with it because of that.The Apple Pencil is not too heavy, either, but it is pretty narrow so if you‚Äôre used to that fat Wacom stylus you may want to add a rubber grip of some kind. Those can interfere with charging them though, so something to think about.Using the Apple Pencil with your iPad and Sidecar on your Mac is a little too quirky; the connection & the ability to see what you‚Äôre drawing in real time through that connection (wired in or not) totally depends on how fast your internet speed is. I just have DSL so it‚Äôs too slow to use, but I‚Äôll try it again when we upgrade our internet. Fair warning for those of you who want to use it in place of your Wacom drawing tablet.Generally speaking, I‚Äôm so glad I finally caved on this. I LOVE using it & find every excuse to play with it, from note taking with Goodnotes to doodling in Procreate or having fun in the lite Adobe apps.

I love how it‚Äôs magnetically attracted to the top of the iPad Pro and then charges. It pairs automatically the first time, but I think I had to go into my settings to turn on my Bluetooth. So if it doesn‚Äôt work right away, that might be why. It also stopped working and wouldn‚Äôt write anymore. Thank goodness it was an easy fix! The tip of the pen had loosened on top, as if were coming unscrewed. I thought it was made like that for calibration, but nope! Just screwed it back down and voila, it worked! It looks really sleek and I love that I don‚Äôt have to plug it in! My favorite part is that I can write like I would with any writing tool. After downloading several drawing and note taking apps, I played around with simple adjustments. It‚Äôs great to go effortlessly between thin and thicker lines, transparency, and different instruments. The colored pencil shows up as a very nice textured-look, the pen is an even distribution of color and line, and the marker is great in the transparency mode. I especially like how I can lay my hand on the iPad when writing and drawing. I‚Äôm sure others have already experienced this before now with previous iPad and Apple Pencil releases, but it‚Äôs revolutionary for me.

Apple Pencil (2nd Generation),4.0,Is it worth the money?,"Reviewed in the United States on February 18, 2021",,True,"I got the Apple Pencil for use with my iPad Air 4.  I like the Apple Pencil, I really do.  It works great for my note taking I do for work.  I don't really draw, but I tried that briefly and it seemed to work well too.I think the big question is, is it worth the full retail price?  I think the answer is, it depends.  If you like to draw on an iPad then I think it's probably absolutely worth it.  The pressure sensitivity seems to work well and it's comfortable to hold and use.If you just want it for note taking and a little doodling now and then, then it's probably not worth the full price to you.  This could also depend on how many notes you are taking though.  It might be absolutely worth it if you are a student and take tons of notes, but in general, most people probably don't need to spend the money on the pencil.If you aren't drawing and just are focused on note taking I would look at the Logitech pencil.  It doesn't have the pressure sensitivity, but it should work fine for note taking.I gave the Apple Pencil 4 stars because I don't think it's a must have accessory and I think it's a little over priced for what it does.  I would just consider what you truly need it for before purchasing.

The shipping took too long so I bought a spare on Amazon, I figured if one died it may happen again and I cannot afford that.  Then the return instructions wanted the bad one pretty quick or else they would charge the card. Not good. They confirmed that the return was received but not if it was accepted without a charge. Months later the repair status is still that a technician will look at it soon.The pencil keeps falling off the iPad and getting lost. This is really bad. There should be a way to locate it - buzz or ring or at least some indicator on the iPad that the pencil is nearby. Regardless if it is paired or not, I have two, and only one can be paired at a time.Mostly it draws fine but occasionally the line does get interrupted and or it makes extra long straight lines or changes the tool when when I touch it by hand (palm rejection not working quite right). Also, the tip keeps getting loose then it stops working.Finally, I never managed to make the tap to change tool feature do anything.",11 people found this helpful

Mine is the iPad Air 4th Gen. It charges in minutes. I can do work on my MacBook Pro and then 15 or so minutes later the Apple Pencil is 0-100! It‚Äôs very fast. And it does maintain a charge for a surprisingly long time also. It‚Äôs sturdy in feeling and it‚Äôs not too heavy but it does feel weighted. I genuinely love drawing with this as it mimics a pen as best as a stylus truly can. I use it with procreate and the palm rejection and pressure sensitivity are perfect. I can‚Äôt rave enough about how perfect this Pencil is for Apple. If you have an iPad, no knock off can hold a candle to the original.",54 people found this helpful

For me, easier to write stuff than to type.  Natural hold, and feels like writing with a pen.  I've only encountered one website that the pencil is a little slow reading the line drawn (maybe because I am drawing geometrics), so a tiny lag.  Pretty much all my apps read a fast, smooth line.  I did learn that if the pencil is not responsive, check to see 1) if you need charge the pencil and 2) if you need to tighten the ""lead.""  The tip screws into the pencil, and if the lead is loose, the line may not be read by the device.

Apple Pencil (2nd Generation),5.0,Love it!!,"Reviewed in the United States üá∫üá∏ on August 24, 2020",,True,"I had a 1st Gen pencil that I loved and was heartbroken when I found that getting a new iPad this year meant I had to pass that to my mom (to use on her iPad) and fork up over $100 for a new one.  I luckily found Amazon had a slightly lower price, I had some money in my gift card to offset costs AND they were going to ship it to me way faster than Apple was (they had a 3 week lead time).  Yay....and I love it.  I have been designing fonts for years and my iPad is my go to machine to start that process.  Plus, I use Astropad a lot to work from my desktop and having a pencil is vital.The matte finish of this pencil is SO much better than the slippery previous pencil - though since I tend to hold pencils pretty hard I have gotten a silicon protector to prevent hand fatigue.  I don't find myself using the double-tap feature much, but glad that it is there as an option.  I love that you can easily recharge it, because I am often caught mid-work when the darn thing stops responding.  Having the cable, or sticking it out of the iPad, was always a BAD idea with the previous version (I almost snapped the darn thing off once).  This model recharged super fast, and easily....Wish it was roughly the same cost as the previous, but it is still the best out there for working on an iPad that is precise and without lag.",11 people found this helpful

Apple Pencil (2nd Generation),5.0,A bit of a learning curve,"Reviewed in the United States üá∫üá∏ on February 14, 2022",,True,"To say I am not an artist would be a serious understatement. Having said that, I am finding so many uses for this I never dreamed of before. My only real problem is that it‚Äôs been so long since I actually wrote anything with a pen or pencil, it will require some practice on my part to make my handwriting legible to iPadOS in order to take advantage of the handwriting capture/translate functions. That is hardly the fault of the pencil, though.I have seen that the battery charge on the Pencil does not last as long as I thought it would. I‚Äôve seen the charge go down 20-25% just overnight if I forget to set it on the charging side of the iPad. I don‚Äôt really know if that‚Äôs expected or not, but I have learned to keep it charging when not actually using it, which suits my needs just fine.Did I *need* this device to make full use of my iPad? Of course not. However, I will use it to the best of my ability and hopefully learn a few new tricks along the way. :)",5 people found this helpful

Apple Pencil (2nd Generation),5.0,IPad Necessity,"Reviewed in the United States üá∫üá∏ on November 14, 2021",,True,"I ordered this refurbished through a secondhand seller, and firstly want to say that it cam in a condition that was as if it were brand new.  If you have an IPad that you use as a productivity device, this is an essential accessory.  2 years ago I had the Ipad air 2019 and the Logitech crayon (as the air only supported the first gen Apple Pencil at the time).  While the Logitech Crayon was effective for writing, and did create a desirable experience, this is far superior, as this is better integrated and more customizable to your needs.  The writing experience as well is just *chef‚Äôs kiss* perfection.  The only con I have is that despite its functional integration with the iPad, there still isn‚Äôt much of a means of securing it with the iPad.  The magic keyboard has no holster for it, and the magnet on the side is insufficient when putting the unit into a bag.  The pencil always falls away into the dark caverns within my bag.  Otherwise, 10/10 would recommend to a friend.",3 people found this helpful
Apple Pencil (2nd Generation),4.0,"Almost perfect, but 1 major flaw.","Reviewed in the United States üá∫üá∏ on November 28, 2019",,True,"Finally splurged for this pencil after using soft tipped, non-accurate stylus‚Äôs for years. Below is my feedback. Note that I have an iPad Pro 3rd generation tablet.- accuracy is excellent. Regular cheap stylus‚Äôs are difficult to select particular letters of words, and they aren‚Äôt good at copying and pasting. Apple Pencil does this extremely well!- controlling YouTube fast forward or back is so much easier using this pencil vs my fat finger.- pencil feels so comfortable in your hand. To me, the perfect diameter.- pencil length is also great as it allows me to reach everywhere on my iPad screen.- the tip of the pencil is pointy but smooth. Won‚Äôt damage your screen if you don‚Äôt have a glass protective cover. And, the thinness of the tip fits perfectly between letters when you want to make a selection.-  battery lasts a very long time.-  recharging the pencil by magnetically attaching to the top of your iPad makes the process so easy!- you will not be able to swipe up using the pencil to bring up open apps nor can you access control center from the upper right hand corner. I can live with this but I hope a software update in the future addresses this.- now the major flaw! You can‚Äôt use this pencil on your iPhone. I have an 11 pro max and it‚Äôs so disappointing that Apple didn‚Äôt make the pencil work on iPhone. For the cost of this item I find that to be unacceptable! Apple, if you are reading these reviews make the next generation pencil work with iPhone!!!However, I still highly recommend this item for use with your iPad.",101 people found this helpful

It holds a charge REALLY well, actually surprised me after using the pencil over an hour I attached it to the iPad and it said charged 100% which was nice.After opening the pencil and using it for the first time, within 30 minutes I thought I had broke it. I couldn‚Äôt get it to work on the iPad at all and I was certain I messed something up. I looked and actually the tip of the pencil had become slightly unscrewed and I just tightened it back up and it went back to working perfectly fine. I have not had to mess with it again.There are no buttons on the pencil (it charges by magnetizing to the side of the iPad) but it does have a feature where you double tap the pencil and you can set it to do different things, for example, I have mine set to switch between drawing tool and eraser while I‚Äôm drawing.Side note the pencil does also work great with just every day touch use!

Apple Pencil (2nd Generation),5.0,"Great Battery, Excellent Quality!","Reviewed in the United States üá∫üá∏ on January 9, 2021",,True,"My new favorite thing! As someone who recently got into digital art via iPad (using Procreate on an iPad Air 4) this is an absolute godsend. I purchased this when the price was around $99 and I don‚Äôt regret a thing. It‚Äôs obviously overpriced for the item itself since you are paying for name brand, but this Apple Pencil is a BIG step from the last, and, in my opinion, worth the splurge. The pairing is easy,, the flat side of the pencil is magnetic and will hold onto the side of your iPad for dear life. The battery on the pencil itself is AMAZING. I‚Äôll use my iPad to take notes in class, and even after using the pencil for that time, it will only be at around 95%. I haven‚Äôt seen it go below 90 because of how convenient the charging is! I‚Äôve been using it for a couple weeks now, and I haven‚Äôt felt the need to get new tips for it. I‚Äôm not sure if there‚Äôs a recommended time to change it out as to not damage the screen, but so far it draws and writes as smoothly as it did when I first got it. Feels natural to hold, and soft to touch because of the matte finish. HIGHLY recommend for artists or note-takers on the newer iPads.",7 people found this helpful
Apple Pencil (2nd Generation),5.0,flawless workflow integration worth the upgrade,"Reviewed in the United States üá∫üá∏ on January 31, 2019",,True,"Visually there seems to be not too much of a difference from the first release of the apple pencil but this iteration 2.0 is definitely worth the upgrade! Charging and connecting is so super easy now. The pencil reacts super well for drawing, sketching, drafting and to me as an interior architect especially well with autoCAD, morpholio and other drawing apps. The tab on the pen to bring the eraser to front makes my workflow so much more enjoyable. Although it doesn't seem like much that Apple has added one flat side to the overall round pencil design it makes such a huge difference in holding comfort. The fact that it attaches magnetically to the side of my iPad pro is super helpful as I don't have to look for the pencil any more. It is right were it belongs to be while not being in the way. Absolute buying recommendation if you are a heavy graphics designer or even just a casual user.

The accuracy is amazing, the pressure sensitivity is spot on, and the battery lasts for hours on end! Not only that, but they integrated a magnetic connector onto the tops of the newer iPad Airs and Pros, so all you have to do to charge it is pop it onto the top of your iPad, and you're ready to go! No need for any cables whatsoever. And you can even double tap the flat side of the Pencil to perform a shortcut of your choosing (such as undo, redo, switch between pen and eraser, etc.) It connects via Bluetooth, which makes it a breeze to set up.

Apple Pencil (2nd Generation),4.0,"Very good stylus, but a couple gotchas","Reviewed in the United States üá∫üá∏ on November 20, 2019",,True,"First off, the stylus is great for taking notes, marking up documents, and just doodling. Very low latency, the matte finish is a much needed upgrade over the glossy material used in the last generation, and it's flat edge makes it easier to just leave on the table. The magnets and wireless charging are definite upgrades.Now, let's get into why I had to buy the new version. I recently got one of the new iPad Pros to replace an older iPad and I still had the first generation Apple Pencil. Me being naive, I thought the old one would work fine with the brand new iPad. Wrong. Even if you have a lightning to USB-C cable and the lightning-lightning adapter, you still can't pair the old one to the new iPad. This is very annoying, but I can't say that I'm surprised. We all know why Apple has made the old Apple pencil obsolete.One more complaint is that you can't do gestures with this pencil. This is a software issue, but it's still part of the experience of using the pencil. For example, you can't bring up the multitasking menu, you can't swipe down to view notifications or control center, the only gesture you can do is swipe up from a corner to take a screenshot. Very annoying that I can't perform these types of things with the pencil.4/5 still works great and got $72 for my first gen pencil so not that bad.",8 people found this helpful

The regular iPad screen is much too smooth for serious writing or drawing. (not the ""Paperlike"" brand - that's garbage *)I would recommend ELECOM Pencil-Feel Screen Protector (either for Drawing or Writing). It makes it much easier to write and doesn't impact visibility much at all (not even the ""rough"" one).The only downside of these (especially the ""rough"" one) is that they wear out the tips faster.

The tip of the pen had loosened on top, as if were coming unscrewed. I thought it was made like that for calibration, but nope! Just screwed it back down and voila, it worked! It looks really sleek and I love that I don‚Äôt have to plug it in! My favorite part is that I can write like I would with any writing tool. After downloading several drawing and note taking apps, I played around with simple adjustments. It‚Äôs great to go effortlessly between thin and thicker lines, transparency, and different instruments. The colored pencil shows up as a very nice textured-look, the pen is an even distribution of color and line, and the marker is great in the transparency mode. I especially like how I can lay my hand on the iPad when writing and drawing.

My case allows me to keep docked, so I recommend that (also one of those that overcharges when I can, so if I can leave it docked and charging, seems the better)...",6 people found this helpful
Apple Pencil (2nd Generation),3.0,Beware of buying this for a student who has an iPad case,"Reviewed in the United States üá∫üá∏ on October 22, 2022",,True,"I am sure the Apple Pencil is nice, but beware that if you have a big rugged case on your iPad (as mandated by my daughter's school) the Pencil is basically worthless. Every time my daughter needs to charge the pencil or use it, she needs to take the case off her iPad, which is a big ordeal. And even if you buy an external charger, it doesn't work because you have to touch the pencil to the iPad charge pad to sync it. This is the most poorly designed Apple product I have ever seen for students. You are better off buying the Generation 1 Pencil or a cheaper third-party version.",2 people found this helpful
Apple Pencil (2nd Generation),5.0,Great successor to the first!,"Reviewed in the United States üá∫üá∏ on June 12, 2019",,True,"The drawing experience on this is exactly like traditional paper and pencil. Refresh rate is instant, and pressure sensitivity is so realistic. I do wish it came with extra tips but not a huge deal. Apple is getting stingier and stingier as their revenues taper so I'm not surprised. Apple brand replacement tips are relatively affordable.Love the weight of the pencil, and how stable it is when you put it down. Never rolls off the table. Charging it is effortless and battery life is great. Makes it more of a must have for the iPad Pro (2018 version). They really got it right this time. I would recommend getting a silicone sleeve with a tip cover for it, mostly for scratch/drop protection. They sell some that don't affect the functionality. I dropped it once while carrying my iPad underneath my arm. I accidentally nudged the pencil off the magnet and it fell on the floor. Another option would be to get one of those singular pockets you strap around the iPad case and hold your pencil in. (They have adhesive versions you attach to your iPad case, but I don't like the idea of permanently adhering something like that. Go for the elastic strap one.) A lot of people recommend the paperlike screen protector or a generic matte version, because it improves the experience of drawing. However I can honestly say that writing directly on the screen feels just fine, won't scratch your screen, and does not wear down the tips nearly as fast as those will! It's like writing on very fine sandpaper.",45 people found this helpful

The Apple warranty department is reviewing this as I was able to produce an Amazon receipt showing that Amazon sold this to me as ""new"", but they told me this was not the first time they've seen this.  I think for me, this is the final straw with Amazon, coupled with reports of them banning books based on political viewpoints, I'm done giving Amazon my Prime money.  As for the pencil, it makes using the iPad easier, but shame on Apple for milking $130 from people for something that should cost no more than $50.

Apple Pencil (2nd Generation),4.0,An incredible form shift from the first generation Apple Pencil,"Reviewed in the United States üá∫üá∏ on April 2, 2020",,True,"The newest iteration of the Apple Pencil is a genuine improvement over the first generation. While all of the technology within remains the same (as far as sensitivities and detection), the simple change in form is enough to warrant upgrading to the new iPad/Apple Pencil combo.The glossy finish of the original pencil is replaced by a matte texture which allows for a better grip. The flat edge serves a dual purpose. It allows for a magnetic edge for easy attachment to the iPad for charging/pairing (MUCH improved over the lighting port ""antenna"" charging of old), and it also acts as a capacitive touch ""button"" to change between two tools (like a writing tool and its eraser). While the internals of the pencil remain largely the same, the neural engine on the new iPad reduces input lag down to an unnoticeable minimum which makes the new pencil FEEL like it got an overhaul as well.Overall, the new pencil is quite enjoyable to write with; so much so that it makes the old pencil feel like a prototype. Whereas the 1st generation pencil was innovative for its time, the new pencil has succeeded in BOTH the form AND function. Truly a technological feat.",

There is a learning curve however; one must learn how to adjust the sensitivity to ones general writing styles and pressures.I'm left-handed, and sometimes that can cause some major issues with art tablets and digital work spaces. This was no problem at all. Not to mention the shape is perfectly fit for any writing style. I did need to learn how to utilize the double click features and other gestures that can be done, but nothing was out of my immediate comfort zone.

Apple Pencil (2nd Generation),1.0,What you don't know about Apple defective products.,"Reviewed in the United States on June 13, 2022",,True,"I bought a defective Apple Pencil probably for about $100. It worked until the first charge ran out and then it refused to charge. I was busy so I didn't call apple support until I owned the pencil for about 3 weeks. They talked me thru resetting it, and it charged. But it only worked for about a week. Amazon offers no return on defective Apple products - you are sent to Apple support who doesn't care how much time you have to spend talking to them to fix the problem.And remember when you brought that apple product online because you were too busy to go into the store. Well if you are unlucky enough to buy a defective product you can make multiple trips to their apple store in 110+ degree weather. And what sad is they know the store can't even help you with the Apple pencils. The store cant do any trouble shooting that can not be done on the phone.Also If they are sending you to the apple store - make sure the store has one in stock. Because thats really all you are going to the store for. They did offer to replace it, all I have to do is make another trip to the store after they order it. Sorry, we can't ship it to you.Really a trip to the store to fix a problem with a brand new device is like paying for shipping when they send you something that is broken in the first placeI‚Äôve spent time on 3 customer service calls and Apple support team sent me to an apple store in person. But the apple store can‚Äôt do anything else to troubleshoot apple pencils the the online person can. And on top of that they did not even have a replacement pencil which is what was clearly needed.I could have bought a new pencil myself for all of MY time apple has wasted trying to fix their defect.At this point, I‚Äôm entirely insulted by Apples total lack of respect for their customers time. This was supposed to be a brand new product. Not to mention Apple's waste of their own employees time, for the amount of time they paid their employees to give me the run around they could have paid for 2 pencils.I'm normally an Apple lover, but shame on Apple.",24 people found this helpful

I mainly made that decision because the others did not detect pressure when drawing and I would rather it do that than have to go back through and fix all my drawings just because I wanted to save money. Also it shouldn't be an issue in general since I found a case that lets the pencil charge but the battery has lasted for a while after on and off drawing throughout the day. Lastly, it is not obnoxiously heavy but it has the same weight as a good quality pen, overall I would say buying this for my ipad air 4 was worth it!",9 people found this helpful

I appreciate that it magnetically charges on the side because if I had to have the older pencil that sticks out of the charging port, it would be broken off inside of my iPad already. That‚Äôs what prevented me from buying the older version. It doesn‚Äôt scratch my screen at all and I haven‚Äôt lost it yet. Knock on wood. It stays charged... I‚Äôve never seen it below 100% charge. I‚Äôm mildly using it and learning more about its features everyday. Double tapping the side of the pencil does automatically bring up a color palette.

When holding the pen with the flat part faced up, the pen stroke is lighter. Even when the pen rotates around seem like the whole left side of the flat has pressure problems. Going to exchange in hopes the new one works better.---- Update #2My previous 2nd gen pen was defected. The replacement pen is perfect in pressure like the 1st gen pen.

I am seriously handicapped and could not use my iPad without this wonderful pencil. When Apple came out with the large iPad Pro, I bit the bullet and bought one along with the pencil.I have lots of bones to pick with Apple, but in a head to head comparison, the iPad Pro is Miles ahead of the competition. I find certain aspects of the iPad to be problematic. The pencil does not always connect with the iPad when you are editing and moving text around. It does not successfully sweep up from the bottom to close programs. It does not successfully pull down from the top to open the control panel. It seems that there are certain actions which require the touch of a finger...I can do this today, but it won‚Äôt be long before I cannot do that. I don‚Äôt know what Apple expects me to do when that occurs.But the pencil, it‚Äôs a treasure.",11 people found this helpful

Convenience of charging with the magnetic port. Size isn't absurd how their too long and technically top heavy 1st gen was. I feel also, that with this pen it glides across the screen less smoothly than on an ipad mini 5 with the 1st gen pencil. So you get a little more feedback. So for those exploring the paper type feel, maybe they want a little more ""resistance"" so you don't have to like pace yourself. The flat side is great for it to stay put. Now I'm just curious as to using a ""grip"" enhancer, much like with pens and pencils in school that help give it more control. I just wish Apple had included some extra tips in the box for the price. AND had included the pen with the purchase of the iPad pro.

Love that it charges by magnetically attaching to the ipad.  Purchased a case with a spot for the pencil where it is still able to charge.  Only thing that I don't like is that it slips out of my hand so easily.  1st gen pencil didn't do that.  I'm completely bumfuzzled by it. Purchased a silicone grip for it, but it's so bulky that I had to take it on and off everytime I put the pencil away ... even though it could charge through the sillicone ... it was too bulky for the spot in the case.  argh.  Oh well ... and there are no extra tips like with the first gen.  That stunk. Sometimes the pencil glitches while using the lasso effect in goodnotes, so you have to repeatedly try.  It didn't glitch with my finger or a friends non-apple pencil ... soooo ... Otherwise, I'm pleased.  The pros far outweigh the cons and it's worth it.",3 people found this helpful
Apple Pencil (2nd Generation),1.0,A warning to anyone looking to invest,"Reviewed in the United States üá∫üá∏ on June 14, 2021",,True,"So the product works great, however I‚Äôve already had to buy two of these because both of mine have died on me after only a few months of use. The nibs are fine, the batteries stayed charged, they weren‚Äôt dropped or anything like that but both of them have crapped out on me. I use my  iPad for art, so these things are taken care of as though they‚Äôre fine China, like these are my babies so I‚Äôm always careful with them. However both of them have died now and it‚Äôs frustrating.I bought my first one with my I pad and it only lasted two months before all pressure sensitivity was gone. I use my IPad Pro for artwork, so once that goes these are useless for anything, because you can only achieve hairline strokes after that.Apple won‚Äôt replace them nor repair them, so I was forced to buy a new one. I looked it up online and everyone said they last a while so I though okay maybe I just got a bad one.Well bought a new one, this one in its defense, lasted for almost 5 months, but then died too. These aren‚Äôt cheap, and it‚Äôs becoming really frustrating when you can‚Äôt find any answers and there‚Äôs no help whatsoever from the company themselves outside of just have to replace the pencil.I don‚Äôt know, this is almost $500 already just spent on replacing these pencils. I‚Äôm going to buy this last one and if it dies on me as well, then I‚Äôm going to look into other styluses. I can‚Äôt afford to be buying these things every few months.I guess anyone looking to buy these, just be aware that you may be in for a constant money pit or perhaps I‚Äôm just having horrible luck.

The pencil itself hasn‚Äôt got a good grip on it so I bought myself a grip for it. Though if you‚Äôre use to using writing with no grip then you wouldn‚Äôt notice a difference. Accuracy is great, so is the pressure. The double tap feature really helps in switching from eraser to pencil, I find it really nice, but not necessary if you‚Äôre looking to go with the 1st generation. I would say the magnetic Bluetooth charging is the reason why I love the pencil so much. Would recommend for any artists or note takers out there.",

Apple Pencil (2nd Generation),1.0,don't drop it!,"Reviewed in the United States on November 16, 2022",,True,"A: Write with it, store it, and drop it.Q: What are the 3 most common things people do with a pen or pencil?  Apple got 2 out of 3 right on the Apple Pencil. Unfortunately, at $129 a pop, the outside casing is a concern. Don't drop it on a hard surface, ceramic tile for one, because the pretty white outside can crack and probably will. Mine did in two places. The crack starts out as a hairline fracture, looking almost like someone scribbled a small line with a #2 lead pencil. Eventually, it spreads both in length and width so it forms a ridge. My pencil was not 90 days old when this happened.  Shame on Apple engineers. Pencils. Write, store, drop. We do all three, the first two intentionally. Dropping is done accidentally. At $129 they need to be designed to do all 3 well. The current material choice is too brittle and unforgiving.  Apple can do better, and should do better. Until then, buyer beware and check out alternatives. When this one stops working I will not replace it with an Apple Pencil. If you do buy one, don't drop it.",9 people found this helpful

And gawd knows you need a case for your iPad, and all the available cases make keeping the pen charged impossible. I'm currently on the hunt for other ways to charge this pen; but damn they need to power this up. Why we need a bluetooth pen is beyond me, sure correction and palm rejection and all that, but come on there has to be a better low-powered way to do these things. Plus the pen for me is just way to dang thick, as I tend to prefer much finer writing utilites, I'm also struggling/learning to translate my style with a much larger tip. I don't like it, but that's just me. Also, at most the pen should priced about half as much as it is, it's current pricepoint just feels greedy.

It doesn‚Äôt write the same why as you would pen to paper, which is an adjustment you have to get use to, but the pencil works perfectly for everything I need it for (college note taking, drawing, the occasional photoshop). It is expensive but if you‚Äôre buying the iPad Pro anyways, might as well splurge for the pencil as well or have a friend/family member clip in for that full experience.",15 people found this helpful

Apple Pencil (2nd Generation),1.0,This thing is stupid,"Reviewed in the United States on March 5, 2023",,True,"For starters, it only works on iPads. And by that, newer iPads only. It does not work on any phones at all. Even their ‚Äúflagship‚Äù pro max. Bought it for a child‚Äôs birthday and have since passed the return window and am now stuck with it. (and now it‚Äôs $40 cheaper) I ordered early because Amazon is absolutely horrible about getting packages shipped to Alaska in a timely manor. It takes literal weeks at best to get things here with prime. Where as we travel south, order the same items, and have them sometimes within hours to our door! So much for trying to be on top of things. Need to go with Samsung products next. This is so stupid.",2 people found this helpful

That alone makes it a great upgrade from the original apple pencil if you are using an iPad pro. Sometimes I use one of those cheap silicone tips that make it a little more grippy on the screen. I use it primarily with Procreate and it works great. The matte texture makes it easier to hold and the flat edge keeps it from rolling off the table of you set it down.

I use it to take notes for work and I haven't wasted a piece of paper since.

It was packaged as if it was new and someone had even wrapped the plastic that you get on new apple products but it was so egregiously obvious that this pencil had been used extensively.It was so bad that I thought some ridiculous situation had come up rather than they were trying to pass of secondhand pencils as new. So I just asked for a replacement. While the replacement looked cosmetically much better, the touch on the side just doesn't work. I can't use tapping to do commands like switch from pencil to eraser. I've tried to fix it in many different ways and nothing has worked.

Nevertheless, there are still some accuracy problems with it on the touch screen and while the magnetic charger and magnetic gripping system is a good idea, you cannot depend on it to stick to the iPad Pro when you are walking around with it; you still need to buy a holster for the pencil to keep it from being damaged or lost.",

To be honest, I did not realize this right away. I was just happy to see it arrive.Well, then I opened up the box to see that it had black markings on it.Then, it came to me, ""is this not new?""So I looked up Apple Pencil 2nd Generation Unboxing videos on youtube. They all had vinyl packings on them. Which mine did not have.So I called up Amazon to file a return. I was not happy about this at all. But, the lady at the customer servicr was very nice to lead me through the process. So I decided not to get angry and just have another one sent to me.But, unfortunately, the story does not end here.So I got the new amazon package this morning.I opened the amazon box. But the item did NOT have a packing either.I was not amused. But nonetheless I pulled on the plastic to slide the box out of the outer pocket.There was another surprise for me there.When I pulled on the plastic, I could see the bottom the box, not the top(with the apple instructions and everything).Like, literally, the box had been inserted upsidedown by some unknown person before me. I thought, well clearly this is not a new product.But this was my second time getting the pen. I was tired of waiting and I didn't want to go the UPS store again to return my faulty item.

If you have larger hands it may be too small to comfortably use for prolonged time like any actual pencil. Having the Pencil 2 is great cognitively for note takers as writing is still the best for retention.

Also the noise the tip makes on the surface is quite noticeable; I was in a quiet room and got people giving me the look.If you get an ipad pro, and need to have this pencil, then go for this overly expensive piece of tech; but if you can use wacom products, your wallet will thank you, and your experience will be probably more pleasant. Then of course these are not reasons you may listen, if all you care is to worship Apple products.

Support sent me there for a replacement and was told, no, Apple won't honor the warranty for products purchased through Amazon).  Don't waste your money on Apple products, I've spent over $6,000.00 in the last five months on Apple desktop, I-Pad, I-Phone XS Max, AirPods Pro and Apple Pencil, and had trouble with every piece of it, requiring at least eighteen calls to tech. support, hours and hours of wasted time and enormous frustration to get their products to work.  Apple has gone straight down the toilet ever since Steve Jobs passed away.  I am seriously considering returning every item that I can get a refund for and going with Samsung replacements.  My Samsung smartphone has performed flawlessly and intuitively ever since I got it four years ago, and hasn't required a single call to Tech. Support.  I've been an Apple fanboy for over 20 years, but after the last five months of frustration and wasted time and energy, I'm not anymore.  You've lost a loyal customer Apple.

You couldn't loosen the tip or tighten it, it was stuck. It could charge but couldn't write on the iPad Air 4.Got a replacement pen. It works normally but now there's a new problem with a tip - when I write at a particular part of the tip, the tip is scraping the screen. The tip is defective.I'm not even going to bother asking for another replacement. A defective tip is annoying, but I'm tired of visiting the UPS store to return items so I'm just going to suck it up and deal with it.If you're curious, I'd just get the apple pen 2 in store at a Best Buy or something. That way, you can test the pen directly in store first before you leave - making sure the tip isn't stuck, that it writes smoothly at all angles - even on a screen protector, that it charges, etc.  It's a stress-free no-hassle, compared to buying on Amazon, receiving two defective units and just saying ""screw it I'm just gonna deal with it, ugh.""",6 people found this helpful

Since I loved the pen feature I decided to just go ahead and spend $125 more to get what I thought would be a much superior product only to be disappointed. The Apple pen is shaped poorly, it is not a round pen so it doesn‚Äôt roll easily in my hands.  The pen is also very heavy as compared to most writing utensils, and the generic pen I purchased.  The Apple pen does not give me the ability to close pages using the swipe up feature, instead I have to free up a finger/thumb to perform this function instead.  The Apple pen performance is a wee bit better then generic stylus, but for my simple purposes the difference was negligible. The double tap, and sidebar charging features weren‚Äôt worth the swap for comfort generic stylus gave me.

The first phone call she was told to connect the pencil to the right side of her IPad via the magnetic connection and to let it fully charge before trying to connect it to the IPad via Bluetooth.  She was told that during the charging process that the pencil and IPad would connect via Bluetooth automatically.  After letting the pencil fully charge my daughter found out that they still would not connect to each other.  That's when she called Apple the second time.  This time she was told that the Apple Pencil 2 will only work with the IPad Pro, not the IPad generation 7, even though it was a new model.  She was told that she would have to return the Apple Pencil 2 and order the older version Apple Pencil 1 in order for it to work with her IPad.

With the insane cost, I expected quality and durability. While it worked, it was great, and I made some phenomenal art. But 14 months after I bought the pencil (2 months after the warranty expired), it stopped working. It won‚Äôt show up in bluetooth devices, despite showing an ‚ÄúApple Pencil‚Äù message when I magnetically connect it to my iPad. It knows the pencil is there, but will not connect. Because the pencil is a simple, real pencil design, there are no lights, buttons, or screens to see what the issue is, and whether or not there‚Äôs a way to fix the pencil. After troubleshooting for 5+ hours, then troubleshooting with apple tech support for 1.5 hours, it still doesn‚Äôt work, and an out-of-warranty replacement is $110, plus $7 to ship back your old pencil. You save ten bucks, but the kicker is that a replacement only has a 90 day warranty, compared to a new pencil‚Äôs 12 month warranty. This feels like a pre-planned money grab by Apple.

I guess I should've figured out that was a complete lie when I was simply trying to figure out which was the latest ipad! The legion of releases, generations, and years associated with each iteration is astounding, and now, this. If it doesn't have broad support across releases from the same year, why would you call it Pencil 2, instead of Pencil PRO, which is a far more fitting way of presenting it?!I'm convinced that Apple intentionally baffles people with the way it labels and presents its product labels, strictly to sell more of their stuff.

Apple Pencil (2nd Generation),1.0,PRODUCT WAS NOT IN ORIGINAL PACKING OR CONDITION,"Reviewed in the United States üá∫üá∏ on November 26, 2020",,True,"Product came opened, with no seal. The box was roughed up, and had marks on it as if it was a used retuned item. I bought it as a gift, when I opened the pencil it looked slightly different than the one I had. Upon testing the pencil I realized that the magnet was not as strong and the pencil itself was a bit thinner than the one I have. I then compared it to my sisters Apple pencil and found the same defects. It seemed like either a really good fake that had been returned in an original box. Very very disappointed, quality control was zero, I could have otherwise just gotten it from the apple store but because of time constraint opted to do so with PRIME. Also, this product was to be sent overseas so returning it is going to be a nuisance from a different country. HIGHLY disappointed.

It did not register any strokes, it will change modes... just nothing. It didn't even register on the setup. I have spare nibs and made to change it. But when I twist it off, and very gently, mind you, it broke apart at the threads, which are now stuck in the pen. The little brass bit is scratched, scuffed, dented and bet.

Apple Pencil (2nd Generation),1.0,Apple Magic Pencil 2 ‚Äì Failed Outside of Warranty,"Reviewed in the United States üá∫üá∏ on October 28, 2022",,False,"Wow, what a disappointment this product is. I paid $130 up front. It is now completely bricked (confirmed by online customer support and genius bar appointment). No explanation why. If you read the myriad of help articles online you will see various explanations related to the users failure to keep the pen charged at all times. While no one ever warned me of that, I can assure you that my pencil stayed clipped to the magsafe charger on the ipad at all times. I also never did anything else to the pencil that would explain it‚Äôs sudden failure.I used this pencil occasionally for work to take notes. ~1-2 times per week. Very light usage overall. It was working totally normally less than a week before it‚Äôs complete demise.As a product the pencil does its job well enough. I can‚Äôt point to anything extraordinary. It is better than a stylus, but not significantly different than its more modern competitors. I was happy to pay $130 for a product a presumed would be functional for a reasonable lifetime, however with so many reports of early failures (days/weeks outside of warranty), the value is just not there.Apple offers only a $20 credit for a bricked magic pencil 2. That means they expect me to pay another $110 for a replacement pencil after mine failed in marginally over a year. Completely unacceptable. I have already begun my migration away from apple, and after this failure I will only accelerate my efforts. I will not be replacing this pencil. I will not replace this ipad when it dies. In all likelihood I will not even purchase another iPhone.",

Apple Pencil (2nd Generation),4.0,I am not sure what the point is so far - seems to be mostly a expensive finger.,"Reviewed in the United States üá∫üá∏ on May 10, 2019",,False,"So perhaps one of these days I will figure out a use for this, but so far I am mixed at the real use. It fits nicely on the top of the iPad pro and charges. It is allows a person to not use their finger, but beyond that there are few apps that you can like write in and have it convert to something interring like text. It is good for drawing- I am not an artist. I think I can use it in affinity photo to touch up photos, but I have yet to try that... So it may just be a waste of money for me.",

However, after using it for a couple of weeks the tip of the pencil has dulled down. I have only used it for a couple of weeks and I don't apply much pressure to it.

Apple Pencil (2nd Generation),3.0,Tracking is Bogus,"Reviewed in the United States üá∫üá∏ on December 1, 2021",,False,"Now, for one thing, you should really buy these from Apple‚Äôs website, but anyway‚Ä¶I used the first-generation for years, and it was practically perfect. It rarely ever acted up. This, however, is total garbage. While it is super convenient to charge it directly onto your iPad, the double-tap to switch between pencil and eraser is SUPER touchy, and is CONSTANTLY getting in my way! For another thing, the tracking is absolute trash. There will be times when I‚Äôm using, say, a pencil brush in an art app, (and these sorts of pens/apps have a feature that if you slant the pen, the brush will flatten and widen like if you used the side of a real pencil) but for some reason, even when I‚Äôm holding my pen perfectly upright and straight, it thinks that it should act as though it‚Äôs slanted, and so, instead of a neat, straight line, I get a barf of thick, wobbly lines that I constantly have to undo. And this goes for every single brush I use! The cursor (as it were) will jump to the side, or curve, or goodness knows what else! I don‚Äôt know if this is some sort of ‚Äúnew design feature‚Äù or what, but it only serves to give me a headache and waste my time. If you can avoid it, I would not purchase a second-gen Apple Pencil. First gen is all you need.",

The gesture tap is a great feature to make use much quicker for changing settings. The pencil charges fast and it magnetizes to the iPad making charging a breeze! The texture is also improved and feels more like a natural pencil and the flat edge - there for charging purposes - actually makes for a more comfortable grip!I do suggest getting a textured glass screen protector.

If you constantly use it and never let the battery level drop, you may be fine, but if you would only be an occasional user and plan on ever storing it, you will find yourself with a paperweight.  Actually, it would make a terrible paperweight because when it did work, I found that it rolled away every chance it got; the one flat edge does nothing to stop that.  It's also very difficult to keep that flat edge where you want it in your hand for tapping on, which was a huge headache.",

The added epiphany is in my case I have to replace my apple pencil tips every two months as I use a paper-like screen protector (4 months for no screen protector scenario).

Apple Pencil (2nd Generation),2.0,Decent experience but needs a screen protector that adds friction.  Terrible battery life.,"Reviewed in the United States on July 30, 2019",,False,"I have seen a lot of reviews over the two major types of styluses that people talk about.  I have both.  I have had the Pencil on my 12.9 iPad Pro and now on my 11"" 2018 iPad Pro model.  The last version was very responsive, but really, really clunky to use.  Too long and the battery life was horrible.  This newer version is better, but still has horrid battery life and loses connectivity, frequently.  Apple solved both of these by reconnecting the device every time you recharge it, which is good.  No other company could get away with this kind of experience.By comparison, the stylus on my Surface Pro 6 has a natural level of friction on the screen, but the response rate isn't as fast.  That said, the battery life and connection reliability are WAY ahead of the Apple Pencil 2.  It never loses connection and the battery life is more like 2 years than 2 days, like the Pencil.  Yes, I know that the MS one uses a battery, but so what.  The battery lasts forever, does more than the Pencil and costs less.

Apple Pencil (2nd Generation),3.0,Not as good as the S Pen on Samsung devices,"Reviewed in the United States on December 4, 2021",,True,"I like the apple pencil. I've tried several different third party ones and this definitely works the best with iOS devices. The apple pencil feels like writing with a big plastic pencil on a window. It's also obnoxiously loud whenever you press down on the screen. If you're in a quiet room, people are going to hear you writing with this thing, which I find mildly annoying in meetings and such. I love my new iPad but I still think the S Pens on my older Samsung tablets had a more natural feel overall & were better for drawing. Good for light sketching and notes, would recommend getting a separate (non iPad) drawing tablet for professional artists. It's ridiculously overpriced for what it is, considering other manufacturers include pressure sensitive styluses that work better than this at no additional cost with their tablets. Again, still the best for ipad, but not great.",4 people found this helpful

I ditched the knockoff and went with the real thing because I didn‚Äôt want something that was 90% good (plus the knockoff had to charge separately, I kept turning it off by mistake when using it). I use the Apple Pencil as a non-artist (I don‚Äôt even have a drawing app on my iPad) as well as someone who prefers to type out notes. As with most Apple over-priced accessories (like the AirPods) it‚Äôs hard to explain in words why it‚Äôs so good. Just buy the real Apple Pencil, use it‚Ä¶ if you don‚Äôt like it just return it.

You may be able to open a app from the Home Screen but then it will write inside that app and you can not close the app by swipe with the pencil.

Apple Pencil (2nd Generation),4.0,"Nice addition to you iPad provided you ""need"" it.","Reviewed in the United States üá∫üá∏ on July 3, 2020",,True,"I got a new iPad and figured having this pen would be a nice-to-have accessory. Personally I don't have a real use for it aside from tinkering around with it on drawing apps. I'm finding new uses for it with process/workflow apps however it's still limited at this point. I'm sure someone in design/drafting would have a real need for this but, for me, it's more a nifty accessory.That said, it's quite accurate and no lag. Battery life is good however not really an issue since you recharge it by attaching it to the iPad. Biggest gripe is that the pen is super smooth so it's a little difficult getting a proper grip on it. I'm getting a skin for the pen so that will hopefully address that issue.",
Apple Pencil (2nd Generation),5.0,Good writing device,"Reviewed in the United States üá∫üá∏ on March 19, 2021",,True,"The pencil works great.  I like the idea of being able to store and keep it charged through the magnetic attachment built into it.  Even though the magnetic slot in the ipad (2020 11 iPad Pro) has a good connection, do not trust on it to keep the pencil secured particularly when you travel or carry it during the day.  Occasionally the pencil will be dislocated and it can be lost.I also found (after using the LogicTech Crayon) that I had to get use to using the double tap to select the eraser function.  Once you get accustomed to it, it works perfectly.  With my handwriting I have to use it all the time.I would also recommend that if you purchase this, you also purchase some replacement tips for it.  My tip has not worn away - as yet, but it cannot help to wear, and you do not want to possibly damage your ipad or tablet screen.I would certainly buy this again if needed.",One person found this helpful

Didn't seem damaged, but the Apple Pencil, which was purchased from Amazon.com Services LLC, was already unwrapped when it arrived.  This was sold as new, so we didn't want to take for granted that it would continue to be okay, or would hold up to a warranty.  Apple was called, and they confirmed that it was not packed the way it should have been.  We don't know if it was actually used, and if used, how long it had already been used, or maybe someone just didn't want it and returned it after trying it.  We don't know if it came that way from the apple store, or if it may have been unwrapped at the distribution center.  We returned the item, and, instead, bought directly from the apple store.

Apple Pencil (2nd Generation),5.0,Apple pencil that works with Ipad Pro 11 2021.,"Reviewed in the United States on December 24, 2022",,True,"¬†This Pencil definitely works with Ipad Pro 11 (2021).This is an Apple Pencil 2nd Generation.What i like about this product:-its an apple product made for an apple device.-ive got a great deal at amazon.-very responsive to the touch screen.(like real time)-i can see accuracy when using it. Very smooth when you draw.-lightweight and it seems like its pressure sensitive when you draw. Ive noticed it when i was using highlighter when drawing.-works well with my ipad pro 11(2021)-it attached to you Ipad so it doesn't get lost and automatically charge.So far i don't have any dislike with this product, however i just have a note for future buyers:-the pen is very smooth that it might slide if you have sweaty hands.-it has no charging port, and only charge directly to your Ipad when its attached.-it came with a 5% charge so you have to charge it before using it but i must say mine charged fast. I left it attached to my tablet and when i came back after an hour its already fully charged.-i cant tell how long the battery will last but i used mine for simple editing for maybe 2 to 3 hrs and it only used less than 20% of its battery. Since i attached it back to my Ipad it just went on charging again until its full.-i haven't noticed any extra tips in the box but i guess because it will last long and has a durable tip.-no side buttons nor like an eraser type on the top end. I thought it look sleek though.-i believe that this is way much better than just buying an alternative pencil for your ipad.Im pretty much satisfied with my purchase and will continue to explore its other features.This is just a suggestion, if you are planning to get a pencil for you Ipad, it would still be better to get an Apple brand so you can ensure compatibility of the product and enjoy its complete functions/features. I know some will say it may a bit costly but try to check amazon once it a while cause there are times that they offer great deals.",2 people found this helpful

However, on sale at $99 it makes it much more appealing, just for the wireless charging and attachment if you have any compatible iPad.If you don‚Äôt care about having the Apple brand and don‚Äôt mind a few inconveniences; get an off brand pencil.If you‚Äôre an Apple diehard and love the ease of use, get this.(For Left Handed folk) - It‚Äôs very obviously focused on right handed people, like most things in this world. iPad/Air Pro 11 and 12.9 both attach to the right hand side when the device is in portrait mode. Of course this isn‚Äôt detrimental, it‚Äôs just something I didn‚Äôt think about when I bought it. As well as the logo and lettering being upside down as most writing utensils have.TL;DR - It‚Äôs worth it!",3 people found this helpful

However please buy the screen protector from Paperlike directly, the ones on amazon are fake and do not work well.I have a 10in (11in with the whole ipad dimensions) ipad pro!Otherwise I much prefer this pencil to the previous 1.0 pencil. I have friends that have it and how they charge it (for on the go activities) makes me very anxious and worry about the pencil snapping if you bump it while charging it directly connected to the ipad...so I'm very glad this 2.0 version charges magnetically. Unfortunately it isn't backwards compatible (can't use previous versions of the ipad pro to charge the 2.0 pencil), but definitely worth the wait to ease my anxiety!",

I was unaware that there was a tip that could fall off. My pencil stopped working and after calling my nephew, who knows all things Apple, I realized the problem was the tip that came off. I googled it and supposedly, you should have received an extra tip in the pencil box but I had no such extra tip. Now I will need to buy a box of extra tips. I really only used the pencil a couple of times and keep my iPad in a nice case. I dropped the pencil once and I guess that‚Äôs when the tip came off.  For the price of Apple products, I feel that the tip falling off so easily is an issue Apple should address.",

This is not the kind of thing you want to order from Amazon's zero accountability, fly-by-night vendors. It's too expensive and too easy to superficially counterfeit. Who knows where it's been or what it's been used for...what if the previous owner was an itchy fella?!? Best case scenario is it's counterfeit and the battery is not a dangerous knockoff.  Well I guess best case scenario is Amazon valuing their customers, but you know.The one that was not previously opened and used works fine.

I loved the convenience of the magnetic charging, and the Bluetooth connectivity, and all the amazing things it did. Of course I misplaced it, and after trying to find it, I gave up, and ordered another one, and figured if I found the first one, I would have a spare. One of my relatives got an iPad Pro as a gift, and while I loved the Apple Pencil, I am not very creative with drawing, and my relative is. After letting them try my Pencil, and seeing what an artist could do with it, I gave them my second one. I kept telling myself that I didn‚Äôt need it, and I did try a bunch of cheaper electronic stylus, but the experience was horrible. I finally decided to just buy another one, making number three. I won‚Äôt bore everyone with what it does, you can read about it online, but nothing available can replace the Apple version, and all the things it does, like swipe to bring up a note, and write on it, and have it convert to real text, is just one of many different things that you can do.

Apple Pencil (2nd Generation),1.0,BUYER BEWARE!!! Got defective pencil- also got charged restocking fee when returned.,"Reviewed in the United States on December 16, 2021",,True,"***Buyer Beware***. I got a defective pencil, it would be inconsistent with the drawing and would need to be run over a few lines over and over. The buttons weren't responsive either. Long story short- I returned this pencil in the original box it came in (See Picture). Few days later, I see that I am charged a restocking fee, even though the item arrived defective, through no fault of my own.Called customer care twice, got hung up both times, agents kept reading off of a script that there is nothing they can do about the restocking fee.I went online and read that it is ILLEGAL to charge restocking fee for an item that arrived damaged. Amazon has potentially lost a prime member for good. First, we trust the quality and buy on Amazon and then the sellers make free money by selling counterfeit products. I know they wont do anything but at least I can inform others to be cautious when buying expensive things off here.*Spend extra and buy off Costco or Apple store.*",
Apple Pencil (2nd Generation),3.0,Falls off the iPad too easily :/,"Reviewed in the United States on May 19, 2021",,True,"For what it cost, I'd like it to not fall off the iPad magnets as easily as it does... replacing the pen if lost in public would be unjustifiable for the cost and for that reason I don't bring it with me when I leave the house.I also had higher expectations, I'd been using a knock off pen that cost around $30 that works great comparatively. Although features the apple gen 2 has is little more convenient for programs like procreate where switching between two tools can be quiet fast with the double tap on the apple pen.Honestly I am just not that blown away. Apple is too hyped, but it's still the best out there...I guess!? Technology has a way to go before it really ""wows"" me. Rating it at 3 starts because I can't leave the house with it on the side of my iPad, even if my  case secures it to the charging magnets, the possibility of losing it is still too risky for how easily it just can knock off the side.",

This is much easier to hold, grippier, fun to use. It pairs so well and it's magnetically charged which was a huuuuuge change from what I used to have to do with the awkward ""charge it from the bottom"" of the 2017/2018 ipads. I definitely feel this one has more accuracy even though many people say that the apple pencil 2 is similar to 1. I beg to differ. I've used this pencil seamlessly on procreate, pixiv sketch, medibang paint, etc. If you're an anime artist like me and you're casual, you WILL LOVE this.
