"SanDisk 256GB Extreme microSDXC UHS-I Memory Card with Adapter - Up to 190MB/s, C10, U3, V30, 4K, 5K, A2, Micro SD Card - SDSQXAV-256G-GN6MA",5.0,Which size and how many do you really only need?,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on April 16, 2023",Capacity: 128GB | Style: Memory Card Only,True,"I recently purchased the SanDisk 128GB Extreme microSDXC UHS-I Memory Card with Adapter and have been thoroughly impressed with its performance. This memory card boasts impressive speeds of up to 190MB/s read speeds, which is powered by SanDisk QuickFlow Technology. I was skeptical at first, but after testing it out with my compatible devices, I can confirm that the speed is lightning-fast and saves me a lot of time during file transfers.One thing I appreciate about this memory card is that it pairs perfectly with the SanDisk Professional PRO-READER SD and microSD to achieve maximum speeds (sold separately). If you're someone who values fast transfer speeds, I would definitely recommend investing in this reader to make the most out of your SanDisk memory card.Another aspect of this memory card that I find impressive is the fast write speeds of up to 90MB/s. This is particularly helpful for fast shooting and quick data transfers. I have used this memory card in my DSLR and it has not disappointed me in terms of speed or storage capacity.The SanDisk 128GB Extreme microSDXC UHS-I Memory Card is also 4K and 5K UHD-ready with UHS Speed Class 3 (U3) and Video Speed Class 30 (V30). This means that it is perfect for recording high-quality videos and taking high-resolution photos. I have used this memory card to capture 4K videos on my compatible device and the results have been fantastic.In addition to its impressive speed and performance, the SanDisk 128GB Extreme microSDXC UHS-I Memory Card is also rated A2 for faster loading and in-app performance. This is particularly helpful for those who frequently use apps or games that require a lot of memory and speed.Overall, I would highly recommend the SanDisk 128GB Extreme microSDXC UHS-I Memory Card with Adapter for anyone who needs a reliable and fast memory card. Its speed and performance are top-notch, and the extra features like A2 performance and compatibility with SanDisk Professional PRO-READER SD and microSD make it a worthwhile investment.",

I use an app that stores all of my encrypted messages as backups on my phone (up to 12GB now), and it backs them up on a daily basis, keeping the older copies of the backup.  That adds up to serious memory use after a short time!  The only thing to do it to have to delete the old ones every few days or give up current backups…or get a new 128 GB SD card to put in the phone.  So, when I saw this SanDisk 128GB Extreme microSDXC, I ordered it.Whenever I get a new SD card the first thing I do is to fill it up with large files.  That tells me two important things:  1.  The write speed of the drive or card (in this case averaging about 30 MB/sec – you need their card reader for the much faster advertised speeds), and 2.  Whether or not it’s really the size it claims to be.  I’ve bought four different SD cards/Thumb drives that claimed to be huge (1 TB) but were actually 32 GB drives that had the hardware on the card jimmied so as to appear to be larger.  The drives would appear to copy the files correctly, but anything over the actual capacity was not really copied, only its name.  I didn’t expect that there would be any difficulty with this card (it being SanDisk and sold by Amazon), and there wasn’t.  I’m glad to say that this 128 GB SD Card actually stores the correct number of bytes (about 117 GB which is really what the 128 GB means – advertising!  Yikes!).  I just popped it into my phone and formatted it as an internal drive (I could have not formatted it and just used it as storage, but I prefer that it be integrated more closely with the phone).So, I’m very glad that I got this SanDisk 128GB card.  It’s everything that it claims to be!",15 people found this helpful

The crazy posts of threads about bad cards frying up inside Nintendo Switch and laptops. I have been buying the official Nintendo cards due to these fears but always on sale never full price! Got a Steam Deck couple months ago and needed a 1TB so I chanced it!Compared the one for Nintendo from Sandisk to the ones I received and they all matched. Green backing where you can almost make out the card circuits and a black label for identification and where it’s made. The cardboard wasn’t a pain to open but the plastic where it houses the sd card and provided reader was a pain!After observing the cards from thread posts of those reporting overheating causing melted cards inside Nintendo Switch and laptops, I realized those cards all had full black backing no visual of the circuits at all. Turns out the one from both threads both OP later reported the cards fakes. So be careful, check them physically, run speed tests or for security call Sandisk customer service for help.Always buy from Amazon directly for better coverage! I got lucky and all of mine 6 cards to be exact, all on different Switches and 2 Steam Decks work! Zero issues and been using them regularly. Very happy with the storage especially now with holiday sales and being able to have all digital stuff ready on devices.Don’t buy these at full retail price, wait for sales like Prime Days or Black Friday/Cyber Monday! You can get 2 for the price of one during those days! Keep them on a wishlist so you see updates on discounts!",63 people found this helpful

Looks can be deceiving!,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on October 15, 2022",Capacity: 1TB | Style: Memory Card Only,True,"Tl:dr  it really depends on your card reader or devices if it can handle the card actual speed.You should atleast know by now you're not going to get the full advertised amount of storage when it comes to any type of memory storage. That being say, my card was off by almost 60GB give it take. I'm happy with that.When i first received the card, my first reaction was that I got a fake card. Normally, the extreme card have a golden color right. This one looks like the golden color was an off color with a slight greenish color. It looks like a bootleg card that scream fake at first glance.First reaction was to pop into a card reader and do some testing on the computer. The advertised read and write for the 1TB card was 190MB/130MB but i was averaging at around 80s MB read /70s MB write. I was willing to live with that because for a microsd card, that write speed is good enough for me as the read speed didn't really matter for me because if i truly only care about the read speed, I would have bought the Ultra A1 version and save a little $$ instead but I wanted a decent write speed and it checks out.But, curiosity got the best of me. So i read through the reviews on here and some say they got fake cards, others are getting speeds close to advertised, while some are getting around the same speed i got.I didn't want to order an actual card reader just to test the darn thing and let it collect dust afterwards. So i order Lexar microsd card usb 3.2 reader on Amazon to do the testing since i know I'll probably use that more than a actual card reader and it's cheaper.Low and behold, speed checks out. Not exactly as advertised but was averaging around 160s read / 120s write. So don't knock it as a fake until you test it out yourself because i know i almost did.

(See my photo)Note that this card advertises that you can get Read speeds of 190 MB/s.  However, keep in mind that those speeds are under ideal conditions and using SanDisk’s own reader that uses a proprietary protocol to achieve that.Realistically, most of us will be using the UHS-I speed of our hardware.

I once pulled out the card and i noticed it was hot. I thought maybe is a was a fault on the camera but to make sure I did a test using a flash card testing software called ""H2testw"" and the card overheated under the ""Read Test"" verifying the files that were written that check for corrupt or damaged cards. After around 10 minutes I would hear my laptop make a sound as if a USB device was disconnected and reconnected and I would receive this error on my testing software. and i immediately check the card and found it to be very hot to the touch.So it seams this card may be good for photos or low demand recording such as 720o or 1080p. But 10-15 minutes of 4k video is just too much demand and the card overheats and seems to disconnect as a possible safety feature or just plain failure to continue from the heat the card itself generates.",One person found this helpful

I've purchased Sandisk memory cards before from Amazon and they have been hit or miss, but this is the first time I've had one that was completely unusable right out of the package. Bought the 256GB Extreme microSDXC UHS-I Memory Card to use in a new Samsung A8 tablet, but the tablet couldn't read the card and kept saying it needed to be formatted. The formatting process would then stall at 20% and would never complete. Figured I might have screwed up and somehow purchased a card that wasn't compatible with my tablet, so I removed the card, inserted it into the included SD card adapter (making sure the switch was set to the unlocked setting), and inserted that into my Windows 10 Dell Inspiron 16 Plus. Again a message appeared saying the card needed to be formatted. However, no matter which formatting options were selected, a pop-up message repeatedly appeared stating that Windows was unable to complete the format. Furthermore, my PC showed the card's capacity as only 30.6 MB (MB?? not even GB??), so basically the entire advertised storage capacity is just... not there.In the end I wasn't able to get anywhere using any of the solutions that Sandisk's product support and my google search efforts brought up. Even Command Prompt wasn't able to format the drive or detect any partitions other than the 30.6 MB one. After wasting almost two hours I gave up. While it's possible that there's some magical driver or software I'm missing which could fix everything, it isn't worth the massive headache of trying to figure all of it out when all I wanted was simple plug and play storage. It's also possible it was a fake, however the packaging was identical to other Sandisk cards I've purchased in the past and it appeared to be unopened. Absolute waste of $30; go buy an SD card from anywhere else.",3 people found this helpful

I've found other cheaper cards will slow down or skip frames when using the most demanding modes whereas using this card will never be the source of your bottlenecks and you have enough settings and whatnot to worry about without having to compromise your video speed or resolution because your camera cannot write files fast enough.  Using this card you will have all your camera's modes available to you, as I've found using slower cards will mean the higher modes will be unavailable (greyed out)  in your device or they will stop recording without notice.  Nothing worse than getting a once in a lifetime shot to find out your camera error-ed when you go back to edit what you thought you captured. Never again don't try to save a couple bucks, just get this card and have peace of mind.",

It was recognized right away. I didn't quite trust that it wasn't a fake device so I downloaded some Linux isos (40G of them, about 10) and copied them 20 odd times to new directories. (Solid File Explorer, but any of them would have worked.) It took a while but you just let it run in the background.Once full, I did a MD5 hash of random files and always got the same correct results. I took it, formatted it again as ExFat in Windows, and it's been working fine since.  (I'm sure the original format would have been just fine come but it didn't want to bother to delete them.)It works just fine, what more can I say? It's slightly slower than internal memory, but that's the case with all SD cards, so not a problem.ExFat on Windows has a default 128KB block size, but that's changeable both downwards and upwards. I'd do It for less wasted space but concerned that the file system code for non-default block sizes might not be 100%; in addition I didn't want to waste the 2x/4x extra memory space required to mount the device. To have 1T storage I think I can spare a few extra 64k blocks.Remember to make sure your device supports a 1 TB SD card, not all phones do. (I think the over-maximum space just wouldn't be available to start with, not that the card would break,)",13 people found this helpful

I determined that the likely best micro SD card type for my steam deck would be one which has the following specs… XC I / U3 / A2. I then decided to stick with SanDisk because it matches most of my other cards which I’m happy with. Finally I decided that 1 TB is the capacity I was looking for. I still feel that the 1 TB takes a slightly higher than desirable price jump over the lower capacity models. But in this case it was needed. So I went ahead and purchased.I am very happy with the card. It’s performance is fantastic and works great in my Steam Deck.
