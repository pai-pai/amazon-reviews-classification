Nintendo Switch Lite - Turquoise,4.0,The Future of Nintendo Handhelds?,"Reviewed in the United States on October 18, 2019",Color: Turquoise | Style: Lite Console,True,"Update (Feb. 12, 2020):I originally gave this product 5 stars because the excitement of a brand-new handheld Nintendo console had not yet worn off. Now that I've been using it for a few months, there are a few things I take issue with.The first issue I've noticed is that the eShop is PAINFULLY slow compared to other devices. I understand that the Switch is behind other consoles in general, but I think there's an issue when it can run Minecraft (a CPU-intensive game) better than it can run the eShop. I know that in my original review I said that the eShop lag wasn't too bad, but it can be at times. I really don't see the reason for this. I mean, it's not a smooth experience at all. The icons take a while to load sometimes and if I scroll too fast I have to wait for it to catch up. It's the same thing when I switch between the menus, too. And no, it's not my WiFi.Now, the other issue I have is the home screen. On the 3DS, you could customize the icons however you wanted, you could put things in folders, and you could even have really cool themes! With the Switch, you don't get any of this. You get a dark mode and a light mode. That's it.Now, if you don't care about these features that's fine, but I personally like having the option to personalize my devices. Also, it's painful having to scroll through the games you have installed on your switch because the icons are so large and you can't make them stay where you want them. It's just really clunky and annoying.Another thing is if you're looking to you're looking to use your Switch for anything other than playing games, you're out of luck. There is no internet browser and no streaming apps. There is a YouTube app, but it's kind of bare-bones and you can't look at comments on videos.So, for these reasons I had to knock off a star from my review. The only reason I didn't remove more stars is because I still believe the Switch is a great system with a lot of potential. I still believe that Nintendo should continue with this idea and I hope that they take people's criticism into consideration.Oh, and this isn't really the SL's fault, but the screen is pretty small so certain games can be hard to play on it because it can be hard to see certain parts of the UI. Just something to look out for.Also, I know some people have already been experiencing JoyCon drift with this console, but I personally haven't had a problem with it yet.Original Review (Oct. 2019)I really, REALLY love this system.I don't own the original Nintendo Switch, and I got the Lite because of the lower price point and the lovely colors. I also wanted to play a lot of the games that are on the Switch, but not the 3DS. I was going to wait for the Zacian and Zamazenta edition to come out, but I decided I liked the turquoise edition better and I couldn't wait to get my hands on it.Now that I have it, I must say that I am very pleased with its performance. It runs faster than I expected from a system that is so small. I haven't noticed any severe lag (although it does lag a little bit if I go through the eShop categories too fast).Speaking of size, the Switch Lite is perfect. It's just big enough that I can see the screen just fine, but not too big that it's uncomfortable to hold. Keep in mind that I am someone with fairly small hands, so a person with larger hands may find the buttons and joysticks to be too close/cramped for their liking.The screen resolution is one of the highlights of this system. Compared to my 3DS XL, the screen is fantastic. Seriously, I didn't realize how bad the 3DS screen is until I compared it with this system. All the games look amazing, especially Super Mario Bros. U. Mario Kart 8 also looks great.Another thing I like a lot is the form factor. I like that everything I need to see is just on one screen and that the buttons right there beside it. It's not that I don't like the clam-shell design of the DS line, it's just that this form factor feels more comfortable to me. Of course, the form factor does come with its downsides. For example, it's going to be a lot easier to scratch the screen and the buttons. But that can be remedied if you just get a screen protector and a case to put it in.Another thing I like is that it comes with a charger. It seems like a no-brainer to put something to charge the device in with the packaging of the device itself, but guess what? When I got my 3DS, I had to buy the charger separately. Just another way for Nintendo to get money out of me, I guess. Luckily they did not make the same mistake with the Switch Lite. I also like that the cable on the charger is so long. It makes it easier for me to charge it and play it at the same time because I can get comfortable without worrying about holding my Switch in an awkward position.Although there are a ton of positives about the Switch Lite, I do have one complaint. My screen came with a stuck pixel. That really annoys me, but because it's kind of a light green/white I can't really see it when I'm playing games unless I'm specifically looking for it on the screen. I can only really see it when I'm in the eShop. It does suck though that an otherwise perfect system would have a flaw that can really be annoying at times. And anyway, Nintendo has said that it's a common issue with the screens so I don't expect that they would do much about it anyway.I was pretty disappointed when I figured out that the DS line of systems is pretty much dead now, but after buying the Switch Lite I'm kind of excited for the future of Nintendo handheld systems. I hope that they come out with more colors for the Lite and I also hope they expand upon this system like they did with the DS line.Overall, I think this system is a drastic improvement upon the DS line, but beware of stuck pixels and the fact that Nintendo does not seem to care about them.",113 people found this helpful
Nintendo Switch Lite - Turquoise,5.0,Excellent portable.,"Reviewed in the United States on August 27, 2021",Color: Blue | Style: Lite Console,True,"This is my first handheld since the original Game Boy. I really enjoy my Switch Lite. The eShop is chock full of incredible titles and I'm very impressed at the game selection. From Doom Eternal and classic Quake to Animal Crossing and Chess, the entire spectrum of genres is covered on Nintendo's hardware. It's black magic how this thing can even run some of these 3rd party AAA games. The games play great and I'm impressed at the performance of 3rd party AAA titles. Doom Eternal doesn't run near as good as on my Xbox One S, but I'm impressed how the developers were able to still cram the entire game into this comparatively lightweight hardware. My Switch Lite is very easily pocketable (even with protective case) and I have an excellent protective case for it; the LeyuSmart Protector Case with HD Tempered Glass Screen Protector (https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B08PBNGWJP?psc=1&ref=ppx_pop_mob_b_asin_image) which I have also reviewed. I run most of my games off a 1TB microSD card and they run perfectly fine, with slightly increased load times, of course, but as a lifelong console gamer, I'm very used to that. For the value of $199, this thing packs a punch out of nowhere and you'll be hard pressed to find a better value among the plethora of portables available nowadays; at least until the arrival of Steam Deck (which is an worse than an apples to oranges comparison, hardware and game library wise - Nintendo does things their own way, they're in a league of their own and they do and excellent job at it).I'm always a fan of the fading 3.5MM headphone jack on any modern hardware, and Nintendo being the ""Apple"" of console gaming hardware, they could have easily omitted it, forcing players to use the USB-C port to jack in a set of earbuds or headphones, but thankfully, they kept it old school. I was pleasantly surprised to see that you can indeed, use the USB-C port to play through a wired headset that way, if you choose (in order for me to use my headset to it's fullest, I unfortunately have to attach the USB dongle which contains the volume controls, so this is very helpful, especially if I play online and voice chat, although the mute and cut mic buttons don't seem to register on the Switch Lite). I'm willing to bet that you could get Ethernet over USB-C with one of the cheap, $15-$20 USB-C to Ethernet adaptors on Amazon to hardline in for faster game downloads (or smoother online multiplayer, if you feel like having it hang from your Switch the whole session) rather than buy the official Nintendo endorsed one, which is overpriced and probably won't fit on that dock with the case I have on my switch, anyway. I plan on purchasing one and will update my review on the experience when I do.I love how you can remap the button and stick assignments in system settings; ensuring that I can play some games using my beloved ""Southpaw"" controller layout (not sure why it's called that, should be the opposite). I was in a doctor's office playing it and somebody remarked they couldn't play on the ""small screen"", but it's fine for me; compared to the regular Switch, I don't have Joy Con rails to worry about breaking like on my son's Switch (he's already on his fourth pair).Nintendo has this thing locked down. You can't customize your home screen (I was hoping for some Android-style customization, here), organize your games, pass messages to friends and Nintendo (again, doing things their own way) seems hesitant to allow other third party apps on it like Prime Video, VLC (I'd love to be able to watch my videos and listen to my music on it), Twitch, Discord, Facebook or Amazon. It is also lacking a basic web browser and there doesn't appear to be a mic built in anywhere; speech to text would have been a nice alternative to smudging your screen or clumsily typing with the buttons and D-pad. I'm a little surprised there aren't any rumble motors it or something for at least a little feedback. Photo sharing to smartphones is very difficult to get working and I end up having to upload my screenshots to Facebook and download them to my phone as a workaround. Unnecessary. There is no review system on the eShop, so you have to look at third party review sites like metacritic before you purchase your games. The speakers are weak, my Pixel 4a has better sound. Another drawback is the lack of a lock; anybody can come along and grab or steal your Switch and have full access to everything on it including buying games on the eShop. The charger that comes with it (while being the tempting USB-C form factor) will ONLY charge a Switch and will instantly short out if you attempt charging any other device with it - I found this out the hard way. I replaced it with a far superior 3rd party option that charges anything.Overall, great hardware with some minor flaws and I plan on getting a pink one for my daughter, which I'm sure she'll enjoy as much as I do.",69 people found this helpful
Nintendo Switch Lite - Turquoise,5.0,Came in exactly as seen/expected,"Reviewed in the United States on March 27, 2023",Color: Coral | Style: Lite Console,True,"Only leaving a 5 star because the product was delivered and came in exactly as advertised.On the other hand, I'm warning you that if you are expecting it to be like a DS.... it's not.Most of the games will need you to consistently connect to wifi, even if the game does not require it.The battery life is pretty bad, unless you have a high quality cable it will loose it's charge when you're using it, even if it's plugged in.Also, as far as I am aware you cannot fully turn it off. The most you can do is ""sleep mode"" which is the equivalent to turning your phone screen off.If you're willing to deal with all of that for the new games it has then its totally worth it! I still like mine and use it fairly frequently but it can be a pain.",7 people found this helpful
Nintendo Switch Lite - Turquoise,5.0,Fantastic Buy With Great Value,"Reviewed in the United States on April 7, 2023",Color: Coral | Style: Lite Console,True,"I’ve had a Switch since 2017 and recently its began to show its age. Seeing as I found the original one slightly too large for my smaller hands, and I had no desire to spend $300, I ordered a Switch Lite. It arrived in excellent condition with no visible or internal damage, and was exceedingly easy to link to my old Switch. I can’t recommend this one enough, especially if you enjoy handheld play as opposed to playing on the TV. This model may not be for everyone though, so I encourage researching which Switch variation best fits your budget and needs.",One person found this helpful

Nintendo Switch Lite - Turquoise,4.0,So much fun!,"Reviewed in the United States on January 12, 2023",Color: Turquoise | Style: Lite Console,True,"I really love this gadget.  At forty-something, I'm a little embarrassed about how much I love it.  A holiday gift card inspired the purchase; I have to admit, using it to get this was one of the best things I've done for myself in a long time.  There are things in the modern, online Nintendo Switch universe that I wish were more clear.  Maybe all those things were a little more clearly spelled out, for early adopters, but I feel like I'm stumbling in the dark a bit.  A few days after I purchased a physical copy of Luigi's Mansion, I tried to claim points for it.  It returned a message saying the offer had expired, but I had only owned it a few days.  Another annoyance for people in the US with limited incomes is the transaction fees on digital purchases  (if your credit card company charges fees on foreign transactions).  Those little fees can add up.  At times, battery life seems to go quickly.  I'm going to try a few tablet tricks, like turning down screen brightness and disabling WI-FI.  Maybe this shows my age, but I miss the official, printed player's guides.  I only found two (Animal Crossing and Legend of Zelda Breath of Wild), and they were expensive.  I liked those guides, because they were a road map, but the good ones didn't spoil all the game play surprises.  I'm not really into the YouTube walk-through idea.  Even if I was, my ISP has a data cap.  Overall, I'm crazy about my new friend, my Nintendo Switch Lite.  Although, it would have been excellent to have the option to buy a purple one.

Nintendo Switch Lite - Turquoise,4.0,I’m glad I have one; I hate I bought one.,"Reviewed in the United States on August 17, 2022",Color: Blue | Style: Lite Console,True,"Nintendo must be raking in a lot of cash right now because they are selling hardware with a chip that nearing a decade in age. The net code for online games is clearly from the X360era, I jest not (with Mario Kart being the sole exception in my experience). Moreover, you have to spend money to use this infrastructure but the blame lies entirely on Microsoft for standardizing that. The analog stick drift is still an issue with this “budget” revision of the original.Despite all that, I decided to purchase this machine. Why? Gameplay-driven games or just games.  Nintendo clearly only has this one thing going on for them and that is they make excellent games, for the most part. If it’s something by their EPD division or Retro Studios, you’ll be in for a treat. However, everything else, especially the third-party games are massively inferior compared to the versions on the competitors’ hardware while having to pay more for those games, something which is commonly referred to as the “Nintendo tax” by the gaming community.People have been calling this a neat little machine for indie games. However, now that the Steam Deck is out and the wait times have been cut down significantly, I’d recommend that over this. But what about the difference in price you may ask. To that I say the games are cheaper on Steam and it really adds up on the Switch and before you know it, you’ll very likely have spent more money with the Switch than on the Deck. If you care about physical releases though then avoid the Deck.There are definitely some things I really like about the Switch. For one, I can now play games while lying on my bed. I can play games in the short breaks I take. I can swap out the physical games I own without much effort (I wish I could hot swap the SD card as well but as of right now, the OS doesn’t support it. Steam Deck does, however, so it likely is not a technical limitation.)As a new owner, you may have to get used to the form factor because the thing is very tiny and also quite light. This device is clearly designed for smaller hands. If your hands are big, then I’d highly recommend getting a feel for it in a brick and mortar store before purchasing one. I remember my first week with this thing cramping my hands playing Mario. But you eventually get used to it.The OS software is serviceable. They have made many additions since launch but it still remains quite minimal, a bit too minimal in my opinion.This Lite variant doesn’t have Joy-Cons so the D-pad on this console is now something that a human being can actually use.I like that I can play Zelda wherever I want. However, I hate the fact that I have contributed to encourage Nintendo to do what they’ve been doing with their Switch line-up.In short, it’s a neat little device that I wish wasn't priced this way and didn’t come with the annoyances that come with Nintendo hardware.",67 people found this helpful

The Switch Lite although nothing physically wrong with it, is completely useless to me and my family. I have two young kids, and all 3 of us have our own profiles which are linked under my main account via Nintendo ID. The problem is is that only the main account holder (me) can play the purchased games on both devices. So the Switch Lite does not work for either of my kids, only my main account. Yes, this can be switched by changing which Switch device is the ""primary"" switch, but the fact still remains that under NO conditions can my kids play both switch consoles at the same time, even if it is two separate games. If you have cartridges instead of digital downloads, you will not have this problem. I just fail to understand Nintendo's logic with this. I understand that they are trying to protect their own content from unauthorized use, but in doing so are rendering their newest device completely useless to customers like me.

The controls make the game relatively easy to play, the console's design is sleek and easy to hold, and the Nintendo store gives you access to free games even if you don't get an external game. I was able to get both Dauntless and Overwatch 2 on the console for no extra charge. The only thing I'm not crazy about is the packaging. I had it will some other things I had purchased, and there was no cushion around the console. Given how the screen is glass, I was not hopeful about opening the switch box, but it pulled through. So besides the packaging, This is a fantastic product and I look forward to getting more games for my switch!",4 people found this helpful

I chose the lite over the original due to its portability.  Big surprise was when I saw a car instead of the usual Amazon van in front of the gate, then I saw an Amazon carrier drop off the package.  Way better than running super mario 3d world on the yuzu emulator, and could not run super mario bros u deluxe nor dkc tropical freeze on yuzu.  Loading times are much faster, so no more concerns.  While it took me 2.5 months to collect all 380 green stars and 85 stamps, I expect to duplicate this in well under two months.  Way cheaper than the Xbox series x, which I was gonna purchase to run FH 4 and 5, but able to run them both on my laptop.

Nintendo Switch Lite - Turquoise,4.0,It’s a great product but almost better to buy the complete switch with joy-cons included,"Reviewed in the United States on October 27, 2022",Color: Turquoise | Style: Lite Console,True,Nintendo is a great company and this product is good quality. It plays all of the Nintendo switch games. If you plan on playing any fitness games or anything that requires motion you have to purchase separate joy cons which are expensive. In my opinion if you’re getting a switch then the regular switch with dock and joy-cons is better to buy Unless you know you’ll be playing handheld games only. Because you cannot play some games without an extra purchase I think the price could be a little cheaper.,One person found this helpful

Nintendo Switch Lite - Turquoise,5.0,A bit of joy to a couple of Gen X-ers,"Reviewed in the United States on August 14, 2022",Color: Turquoise | Style: Lite Console,True,"My girlfriend and I are both in our 40's, and neither of us have owned any modern (post 2000) game console. For me it was a Super Nintendo, for her an N64. I borrowed a Nintendo Wii from a friend and loved it, but I never bought one. We just wanted something handheld that you can play the old school games on. I've had my eye on a Switch Lite for a while, and finally purchased one a couple of weeks ago. I don't know the technical ins and outs of modern consoles, so I'm just going to keep my mouth shut there; but after an easy setup, this has been a ton of fun for both of us. I would like to ease my way into newer games, I just became uninterested in video games from my teenage years to recently, so nearly 30 years in this particular realm of technology has largely passed me by. But like I said, my girlfriend and I have been having a lot of fun reliving the 80's and early 90's with this.

Nintendo Switch Lite - Turquoise,3.0,Great for kids but Nintendo account sharing is a nightmare,"Reviewed in the United States on March 11, 2022",Color: Turquoise | Style: Lite Console,True,"My daughter absolutely loves her lite.  The device itself is amazing and great for travel.  There are a few downsides like not being able to dock, and some games like just dance won't work.  If you want to use it for a travel or just for standard games like Zelda and Mario this is amazing.The reason that I am giving the product 3 starts instead of 5 is all due to the family sharing.  Many will use the lite as a secondary device.  This is at least what my family has done.  We purchased a switch a few years ago for the family and for Christmas  our daughter really wanted to have her own.  We have a family account so the whole family can use the applications on the family switch and the kids do not need to use my account.  This would you think work similarly for the 2nd switch but that is not the case at all.  The ability to use the games on the second switch is possible but the standard way is terrible, and that is completely on Nintendo.The setup that we have that works is thisFamily switch is primary console and my account is primaryAll games are bought on this console digitally through my accounteveryone in the family can play and game on this switch and can dock and play as well on their profilessecondary switch is using my profile as the main and it needs to be online to play any gamescannot use any other profile on the switch because I am the owner of the gamesboth of my kids can play at the same time the same game but need to be on my profile on lite and their profile on switchI know that Nintendo wants users to buy multiple copies of the games to play, but my kids accounts do no t have payment methods and we did not want to have a lot of disks lying around.  We put in 512GB cards so that we would not need to worry about space.If Nintendo could allow family sharing allow every switch in your house play every game locally even if it is only 1 person can play the game at a time this would be amazing.  As it stands now family sharing is killing the usability.  I can play the same game on my PS4 and PS5.  I can also do it on my xbox one and series x.  Nintendo needs to match what all of the other platforms are doing for as much as you spend on these consoles and games you should be able to play them without needing to jump through a ton of hoops.",4 people found this helpful

Nintendo Switch Lite - Turquoise,5.0,Simply amazing!,"Reviewed in the United States on June 2, 2022",Color: Blue | Style: Lite Console,True,So before I bought this I have owned the 2017 model switch and the OLED. To me I always saw the switch as a handheld device first. I just never could play with it for very long do to the size they are and my hands being small for adult man hands. So I was curious on how the Lite would be and if I didn't like it I knew some kids that I could give it to. But I love this thing absolutely love it! It's perfect for my hands I can play the majority of my switch library with no strain on my hands and I don't need to carry around a big case to protect it. It just goes in my pocket and I'm off. Now it's not perfect by a long shot but it is worth getting if you primarily play in handheld mode and you have smallish hands. Few things to note about the cons. Battery goes pretty fast you can still get a good chunk of gaming out with it. Just be aware you will probably need to take a power bank or a wall brick and cable to charge if you are going to be out and about all day. But hope this helps and have a nice day.,6 people found this helpful
Nintendo Switch Lite - Turquoise,5.0,From what I've used before this one works great,"Reviewed in the United States on September 10, 2021",Color: Turquoise | Style: Lite Console,True,"I never owned anything outside of used PSP, and used 3Ds. But from I know about games this one is awesome. Defiantly worth the buy. I've always enjoyed handheld game consuls over ones that connect to the computer or the computer cause I always feel tied down. Whereas playing a handheld gives me the freedom to play where I want when I want. Also I love it cause it gives me the joy of the PSP and the 3Ds as it has all of those fun Nintendo features but also a large single screen. I don't play that many RPGs and mostly play visual novels but for me its preformed great. The graphics show up clear and it feels nice. I can't really say about it's durability cause I bought a case, and carrying bag for it at the same time and even though I dropped several times by mistake that was probably due to the case protecting it. However I know Nintendo products are made verily well. And it feels WAY more sturdy then the PSP was and since its just one solid mass it appears it will last longer then a 3Ds [which I've scene the top screen break off after a long period of time and several drops later] The only thing I would really say is it doesn't seem like it is comfortable to carry around if you don't have carrying bag. I don't really know how you would do it. But a simple carrying bag and the thing is light and easy to carry. Extremely fun.  And great if you want a Switch without buying the 300 dollar one. As it gives you the same experience without connecting to the TV which for me isn't any bother anyway since I rather play on the go.",

Nintendo Switch Lite - Turquoise,5.0,For Those who travel this is better than the original,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on September 27, 2019",Color: Turquoise | Style: Lite Console,True,"I travel a lot and this is MUCH BETTER for me than the original switch.  The reasons for this are#1 - Less space.  Overall it is smaller in how much room it takes up in your bags or on your carry on.  It's not a HUGE difference between this and the original, but enough to comment on it.#2 - Joycons are connected.  This may not be a positive for everyone but it is for me.  My old switch kept on occasionally having the Joycon come off of it while it was in the case while traveling through the airport or other locations.  This was annoying because you'd have to snap it back, or if it was really minor and you didn't notice it, you'd get a notice and then realize you had to snap it back.  You never have to worry about this with the lite.  Those who preferred removable Joycons will probably dislike this as it makes it so that you cannot really play a multiplayer game with what comes in the box, but for me it is a bonus.3 - Longer battery life.  The lite, simply put, last longer on one charge than my original Switch did.  I REALLY enjoy this feature the most out of all the differences of the Lite and the original switch.4 - It may be just me, but it feels more solid and durable than my original.  It doesn't feel like it will break in half (Though the original has not broken in half or cracked on me yet either, it just feels more fragile like it will).  The smaller size may have something to do with this.5 - It has a D-pad instead of buttons.  I enjoy the D-pad.  ON the downside, with the controls ,as the lite is smaller, for those with larger hands it can feel more cramped.Overall, I really like the smaller size for travel, and the longer battery life (also with travel, as this is a great perk).",8 people found this helpful

But it works great, the battery holds up so far and it charges quickly. It will not, however, hold an entire library worth of games so if you flit from title to title like I do? Do yourself a favor and buy a high capacity SD card. Completely worth it for my ADHD self. Especially if you have a penchant for the games with more detailed graphics.The Switch Lite does not, on that subject, have the greatest graphics itself. But it does look good, plays good, is nice and portable and checks all the boxes in general for what I wanted in a handheld.Here’s to hoping that it survives as well as its predecessors.",
Nintendo Switch Lite - Turquoise,4.0,Lite for a reason.,"Reviewed in the United States on February 1, 2021",Color: Turquoise | Style: Lite Console,True,"Pretend the regular Nintendo Switch doesn't exist. The Lite version is a very nice handheld from Nintendo and they have made handhelds basically since 1989 with the original Gameboy and even earlier with their Game & Watch series.So you know the drill. The Switch is $299, one hundred dollars more than the Lite. If you consider buying a Lite for just this reason, you are better off saving up the extra money for a regular Switch. But if you own one already, then the Lite could be a good companion to it.Personally, I have owned the Nintendo 2DS for about two or three years. This handheld lacks many features that the 3DS had such as Super Nintendo Virtual Console compatibility and also no Amiibo support. I think that console was $90 at launch which is a great difference between that and a ""New' Nintendo 3DS XL.I don't see having a Lite to be a huge deal breaker or compromise. Before buying a Lite, I had Wii U. That console could be played handheld mode as a companion to a TV set. The fact that a Switch must be docked to work with a TV I see as a downgrade. There were many good games on Wii U which are being ported to Switch in some manner or other.If you don't care about TV docking or tabletop mode but just want a great handheld console, consider the Lite. Or get a 2DS to play a good collection of older titles which cost less money typically. ($40 compared to $60 per games.)",One person found this helpful

I’ve owned and loved the original for a few years, but never felt like it was comfortable or cute in handheld mode. The original was heavy and hurt my hands after playing for a while. Superficially, I also hated that it just was nowhere near as cute as my pink 3DS XL was. The coral Switch Lite is much more appealing to the eye, sleeker, and lighter. Way more comfortable to hold for extended periods of time and actually cozy to use in bed or on the couch. I still use my old switch for games that I prefer on the TV, but for portable gaming, the Lite is ideal. I was worried that I was being a little too extravagant buying a second Switch just for a better handheld experience, but ended up not regretting my purchase one bit.",2 people found this helpful

Nintendo Switch Lite - Turquoise,5.0,Amazing for portable gaming (Minecraft),"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on July 19, 2021",Color: Coral | Style: Lite Console,True,"I bought the Switch Lite to have a portable way to play Minecraft without the difficult struggle of Pocket Edition's controls. As someone who has gome through several handheld game devices, this is a pretty good buy. I bought Sailor Moon skins and button covers to make my Coral Switch Lite look more interesting which I suggest buying along with other accessories such as carrying cases etc etc. If you already own the console, I wouldn't purchase this. We have a family one and it was my choice to get something for myself to take to college and work. While it's extremely easy to take places and is pretty easy to figure out- I recommend bringing portable wifi or having a hotspot available. Otherwise you might not be able to play. Luckily this is mostly staying in the same room I sleep in so I'm not too worried about it, however that can be a big factor for others. The memory is also very known to be limited so be sure to buy more when you need it or before hand. Overall I've had no trouble with my switch lite, I made a new Nintendo account, bought and downloaded Minecraft, logged on to my other accounts and have been playing just fine. And for Minecraft players, Yes, please buy this over pocket edition.",4 people found this helpful

It’s very reasonably priced at $215 for my turquoise switch lite. Although I’ve seen some people complain about the screen size, I personally don’t think it’s too big at all. If anything I was worried it would be bigger and am relived it’s smaller than the original switch.  I am used to and have used Nintendo products before though so as long as it was small enough to carry around, I wasn’t too concerned about it. I’ve had no problem with the functionality of it and I think the sound is perfectly loud and fine for me. I would 10/10 recommend this product to anyone who can’t find it for reasonable prices on other sites since everyone and their mom is buying it for their quarantine boredom but definitely happy I chose to treat myself to this :) 👌🏽👌🏽",One person found this helpful

Nintendo Switch Lite - Turquoise,3.0,It's a nice game system but not great for adult hands,"Reviewed in the United States on November 11, 2022",Color: Blue | Style: Lite Console,True,"Over all I like the system as a hole. It's easy to use and link your account from your old system. My only true complaint is ergonomical, it's too flat. It's already too big to fit in your pocket so I don't see why it had to be so flat, but this is an issue I see with almost all of nintendo's gaming systems. The second ergonomical issue I have with the system is the position of the lower right joystick. When pushing the B button above it your thumb also runs into the joystick. Maybe this isn't a problem for the smaller hands of young children, but for teens and adults it can cause issues with playing some games. If you look at the left joystick and d-pad there is actually about an 1/8"" wider gap between the two than the right side joystick and buttons.",

Nintendo Switch Lite - Turquoise,5.0,Good value!,"Reviewed in the United States on August 27, 2022",Color: Turquoise | Style: Lite Console,True,We bought this for our 10 year old granddaughter Christmas 2021. She’s not a gamer but loves this device and the Animal Crossing game that we bought with it. Nearly 8 months later and she still plays on it regularly.The one negative Is that there are not enough compatible games for this device that are wholesome. Animal Crossing is relatively innocuous but has some elements that are disturbing for young kids.,6 people found this helpful
Nintendo Switch Lite - Turquoise,4.0,Mostly impressed,"Reviewed in the United States on September 20, 2019",Color: Turquoise | Style: Lite Console,True,"Here we have the Switch Lite, for those who are ready to ditch the TV and make your Switch entirely a portable device.Let's talk about that for a moment. This is an entirely portable device, just a tiny bit larger than a Vita (for the seven of you who have one of those), and with a screen about the size of the average smart phone. The form factor is definitely smaller than that of the regular Switch, and it's much lighter. It's really very comfortable to use.The JoyCons are no more. They still exist, in the sense that you can have external ones attached to this baby, but the system has a pair built in. Now with external ones, you could probably play some two player games together, but honestly I don't much see the point.The screen quality is excellent. Breath of the Wild and Smash look amazing. The games play well, too. It takes a hot second to get used to the controls, but once you're there, you're golden. The sound quality is also very good.The one complaint that I have about the system is the same complaint we've all had about Nintendo in general for years: the online component. I have two X Box 1 S systems (don't ask why), and with those, my game saves, and downloaded games are easily available on both systems. I don't even have to really put any effort into it.With the Switch and Switch Lite, it's different. You have to go through several annoying steps in order to make it happen, and even then, you have to set up one as your primary system and the other as the secondary (I haven't been able to figure out how to do this yet).That complaint aside, and it isn't a small complaint, I'm quite pleased. It's another worthy handheld for Nintendo!",364 people found this helpful

I thought I was just seeing things because when I went back to the page again a few seconds later, it showed the overpriced of $280 -300 instead. I really don’t know how but somehow I was very lucky to grab this coral switch for the retail price. Really, I had to refresh my order page a couple of times to make sure I wasn’t dreaming. I still didn’t want to believe it even after amazon notified me that the item will ship soon. Anyways long story short, I refused to believe it until I finally got this lovely switch yesterday.

It is soooo great! I bought it used-very good and honestly it almost seems brand new. I was super worried it would come damaged or with scratches or that it would get lost. But nope! Got delivered to my doorstep not a scratch, and even needed a signature too which made me feel so much better!! Anywho about the actual switch. I was also worried that the screen would be too small and I wouldn’t enjoy playing breath of the wild or Skyrim on it (soon the new animal crossing game as well) but while playing, it seems as tho I’m playing handheld on the regular switch (playing docked and on a tv gives me a headache anyway so I prefer this) the only thing I worry about now is the drift issue which happens on the switch where the control sticks start to drift. Luckily I know how to fix that myself (you can watch YouTube videos on how to do it) but unfortunately, instead of just taking apart the joy cons I’m gonna have to take the whole thing apart and get under the motherboard 😅😅😅 so. That hasn’t happened yet but I definitely encourage  Nintendo to do something about that since the lite can’t replace joycons for those who don’t know how to fix them.",

Nintendo Switch Lite - Turquoise,5.0,Awesome device for those who like playing handheld,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on January 3, 2020",Color: Turquoise | Style: Lite Console,True,"I bought this for my boyfriend who is normally a PC gamer (and who chose the 5-star rating for this review), but he wanted to play a few certain switch games. He really loves it and to my surprise wishes he had some of his PC games on the Switch Lite instead.He likes the d-pad on the right which the normal switch doesn’t have since the joycons all need to be the same. The one con to this compared to the normal switch is that if it’s low on battery and he wants to play, he needs to sit by the wall to charge it. No docking option.Games with a lot of text are especially nice for him on this because he has a hard time reading the text on the TV, but not when playing handheld. Of course you could achieve this with a regular switch, but at a higher price point.So in conclusion, if you have a hard time with reading on the TV and would like to play handheld all of the time, this is a great alternative to the normal switch. On the other hand, if you like playing on the TV or if your eyes have a hard time looking at small, close up screens for long periods of time like mine, the normal switch is worth the cost.",

Nintendo Switch Lite - Turquoise,5.0,Great new version of the Switch,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on June 13, 2020",Color: Coral | Style: Lite Console,True,"The Switch Lite is a little smaller that the original switch, and due to that it is more comfortable to hold and play.  Since we got it a few months ago, it's been getting 2 to 4 hours of play a day (thank you Animal Crossing) and the battery only needs to be charged every 2nd or 3rd day.This is our 2nd Switch and we've 4 users on the 2 Switches.  We were disappointed to find that only one user can play a game that's downloaded onto a secondary Switch.  We initially downloaded Animal Crossing on the Switch Lite but only I could play the game and neither of my kids could.  So we ended up transferring the license to our ""main"" Switch, there all of us could play the downloaded version, and then put the physical game card in the Switch Lite (our secondary) and we all could play on that.So long story short, if this is your second or more Switch, buy the physical games rather than download them.Otherwise the Switch LIte runs just like a switch, only you can't display the output to a TV, it's only viewable on the unit itself.",

I have Animal Crossing and wanted to be able to play it with her at the same time. Extra bonus that came with purchasing this for her is how it has also helped improving her reading. She was struggling a little this year as a first grader with reading. Since she received her Switch and Animal Crossing for her birthday (just this past March 2021) her reading started improving by leaps, it was even noticed by her teachers at school. I think the Switch just aided with helping make reading a little more fun for her, which made it more interesting than assigned reading. Both myself and her daddy are/were readers, but like her, reading has always been less interesting when it's been required reading. I will always be a ""Nintendo Kid"" and I think my daughter will as well.",

I simply fixed it the first few times by recalibrating but the time after it wouldn't correct even by recalibrating and finally I messed with the buttons until it finally quit drifting. But I could only imagine if I couldn't get it to stop and having to go pay for repair would make this device not really worth the cost.

I confirmed this in two ways.1. Bought some international software to play on this US Switch Lite. It worked perfecta as it should have.2. I also communicated with Nintendo customer service. This was before I purchased the international software. They confirmed that indeed these consoles are not coded by region, in essence making them region free. They did give me a disclaimer that maybe not all international's features are guaranteed to work on every console. We haven't had any issues at all, everything works perfectly.+ Its region free. Region coding a offing stupid and super annoying. Im glad they did away with it on this console.+ Its portable+ Great price for a portable game console.+ Nintendo customer service is awesome! You can even contact them via chat.- Do not try top transfer a user profile from one switch to another. It was super confusing and I ended up losing all my saved data. Yes that did piss me off. I am knocking a full star off for that.The Nintendo Switch is my current favorite gaming console. LUVLUVLUV it.",

Nintendo Switch Lite - Turquoise,3.0,"One step above the 3DS XL, but not much.","Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on October 17, 2020",Color: Turquoise | Style: Lite Console,True,"The Nintendo Switch Lite offers handheld only play. Which is fine. The color of the Lite is cosmetic only with many different case and skin options. I was able to play a game on the Lite as I play on my console and the first thing I noticed was graphic issues. Distant artifacts (moving objects, other players, static objects) tend to be more pixelated. The farther away they were the more pixelated they were. Some I couldn’t even recognize, even though I’m extremely familiar with the game. A simple 15 minute game play reduced the battery from 100% to 83% with the game mentioned earlier. Battery life varies from game to game. The device got warm while playing but was noticeably warmer while charging, in sleep mode. Thankfully there is a setting to power the device completely off to save battery instead of keeping it in sleep mode. The device felt sluggish trying to play said game. Not sure if the game was taxing the system as there is a lot going on and needs to be connected to WiFi. Has many Nintendo classic games for sale of course, or you can buy new games for $60. Which the price of them doesn’t fall for almost a year. The screen is a touchscreen. Overall I would give the Nintendo Switch Lite a generous 4/5 stars. But I’m reality it’s a 3/5 star device due to no backward compatibility with prior system games, high cost of games long after they’ve came out, very limited free games section, weak battery life and as I said before a weak graphics chip. The Lite should have cost $150, with the regular switch costing $250. If you see the Lite being sold for more than $199 then your being scammed. Buy from someone else or someplace else. The regular Switch is being sold for $299. Again higher prices means your being scammed. Regardless of the color of the device or controllers.",

Many others were massively price gouged.This was purchased for my partner as we both had started using our original full size Switch more and needed an additional console. The Lite gets right as a handheld system all the things the full size switch got wrong. It's much more light weight and far more comfortable to hold. It just feels right. Our original switch stays in docked mode 99% of the time.The screen size is perfect, I was nervous it would be too small but it's exactly where it needs to be. My only real issue with the screen is there's no way to tweak the settings other than brightness, but that's just nitpicking.The blue is a lovely color.Through the years we have had several Nintendo handheld systems in our household and I think the lite is my favorite so far.",

It doesn't fit my hands under any circumstance. I had to buy joystick grip wraps and a left/right hand grip attachment to even midly game on this. I think my next move is controller, stand. I also had to buy earbuds for it because the built in speakers are a joke. Very quiet in majority of cases and sound extremely tinny. The default charger is also pathetic. It takes all night to charge up but only hands for 3 hours. I had to buy a quick charger.This device is still a switch. It's amazing in its selection of games and how nice they can appear with smooth frames. For the portability and ease of storage. This device is absolutely worth it. However the reasons I've stated above are giving me some buyers remorse now I've seen its an accessory trap.I've used the normal sized switch and it's perfectly fine. You get what you pay for I suppose. I went with this because it was $300 less than the switch oled.6/10 experience. Acceptable buy not ideal.",

I got the coral pink color which is very vibrant and pretty to look at.I was pleased with how many games are available which makes it perfect for someone who wants to take games on the go or if you just prefer handheld gaming in general.For people trying to decide between the original switch and the lite, the switch lite does not have the detachable joy cons or the ability to play on your TV screen but if it's just a pure portable system you are looking for the switch lite is well worth it and for a much more attractive price than the original switch.",

Nintendo Switch Lite - Turquoise,4.0,Beautiful but Flawed,"Reviewed in the United States on September 26, 2020",Color: Coral | Style: Lite Console,True,"Had it for almost a week and enjoying it. A few hiccups here and there but nothing major. Bought some accessories for it too. Just wish software can continue to download without stopping in the process while in screen lock. Also, wish it had built in bluetooth. It’s 2020 and I was quite shocked to learn that none of the switches (regular and lite) have built in bluetooth, so I will have to buy a bluetooth adapter for it. I am not a fan of the built in speakers. Some games allow the full range of volume, while some make the system sound very low which is the reason I want bluetooth to use my JBL speaker for a better experience. It’s a handheld, which I understand, so I am not too bothered by it. Overall, I still prefer over the regular because I wanted a handheld for personal experience rather than share with others.

Nintendo Switch Lite - Turquoise,1.0,Broken At Launch - Cannot Accept Memory Cards (Updated - Ongoing Saga),"Reviewed in the United States on September 20, 2019",Color: Turquoise | Style: Lite Console,True,"This system was ordered with eagerness and opened as soon as it arrived. It will not accept any memory cards. Continuous error messages. Tried with multiple cards, reformatted, nothing works.Nintendo support did some basic troubleshooting and told me it had to come in for repair. I cannot recommend anyone purchase this system at this point. I will update my review if and when they fix the issue. For now I am stuck waiting on a repair for a system I was unable to use.Full disclosure : I am a die-hard Nintendo fan and have owned every system including the Virtual Boy. I have Nintendo systems from the 90s that still work fine. Something is broken with the Switch lite software.UPDATE- 10/16/2019 : the repair has been with Nintendo for over 3 weeks now, and they can't seem to find it. It may be lost internally (they have admitted ownership of it as tracking confirms it was received). Now have to wait at least another week for an investigation.Had my system for minutes before it broke - now Nintendo looks like they will take over a month to 'fix' my issue. Will continue to post updates.UPDATE 10/21: They 'found' the system and it is 'in service' - they say I should get a tracking # within the next 5 days - so we are looking at a 5-6 week repair window. Will report back when the actual device is in-hand.UPDATE: 10/25. System is back in-hand. It threw a bunch of error messages when I fired it up but finally updated and now works. I sent in a 'new' system and received back one that had residue, fingerprints, and scuff marks on the case. Not happy. Nintendo offered me a 6-month window to return to fix the cosmetic case issues - I don't feel like waiting another month for a 'new' system, so I am going to see if an error message pops up in my use over the next few days. This process has been very painful and I can't suggest getting a Switch Lite given the experience I had.The system appears to be working and seems pretty neat - will update with impressions once I've clocked some time in it.UPDATE 2: 10/25: System is regularly, if not consistently, failing to recognize the memory card. Out of 5 power cycles, it did not recognize the card on 3 of them. System is going back to Nintendo for another round of repairs. I've asked them to replace the system since it came back with cosmetic blemishes in addition to it having the same problem. Will continue to update this review. Don't buy this system.UPDATE 3: 11/27:  Nintendo replaced the system and it works fine. Loving the system so far. I understand that lemons happen - but Nintendo's TWO MONTH turnaround earned them that 1 star.The device, that now works, is very enjoyable. Happy to have a happy ending on this.",232 people found this helpful

Nintendo Switch Lite - Turquoise,5.0,Quarantine Starter Kit,"Reviewed in the United States on June 25, 2021",Color: Turquoise | Style: Lite Console,True,"I probably would have never bought this if it weren't for quarantine/ life during 2020. But here we are and I'm writing a review. This was one of the best purchases I made during this pandemic. And Yes I bought it for Animal Crossing. Also a purchase I don't regret. This was very portable, as in, I went from my living room to the bedroom or porch with it. Because, pandemic.... Now that restrictions have been lifted, I find my self still using the device, so clearly it has made an ever lasting impression on me. So in-conclusion, BUY ONE. NOW!",
Nintendo Switch Lite - Turquoise,4.0,Great for a single unit but not worth having a second switch.,"Reviewed in the United States on May 5, 2020",Color: Turquoise | Style: Lite Console,True,"I already have the full size switch and was hoping for something more compact for travel.  The lite is great but it is not worth the hassle of having two switches especially if you switch between them regularly as the unit that is not the primary will constantly require an internet connection to see if the game is playable.  I think Nintendo could find a better way to do this as it is really inconvenient if I have to find an internet connection just to play my games.  With the full size switch the connector at the bottom makes sense for docking even if it is annoying but Nintendo should have used the opportunity to put it in a better location. It is absurd that they still, even after all of the comments on the original switch, did not included bluetooth audio capability.",

My only issue is fixable with wearing blue light filter glasses, but Switch Lite does not offer a native on-board blue light filter.Using the clear grip protector not only helps protect it from drops but it makes holding the console exponentially easier.Very happy with the purchase even though I'm not much of a Nintendo person (at least not since the early 90s) - many games available, including ""great deals"" content.",

Nintendo Switch Lite - Turquoise,5.0,Great Handheld - Unfortunate Timing,"Reviewed in the United States on March 24, 2020",Color: Turquoise | Style: Lite Console,True," I bought this Switch Lite so that I could play Animal Crossing. The console itself was awesome. Great display and great weight. I unfortunately had a run in with joycon issues (video attached). As of the time I write this review, Nintendo does not support save transfers for Animal Crossing so I decided to return the Switch Lite for a refund and purchase a regular Switch so that I may use workarounds for potential controller issues if they arise. I'm thankful I was only a few days into Animal Crossing and still within my return window for this device.Do not let this deter you from purchasing a Lite if that's what you really want. This is a great portable and cheaper alternative to the Switch. I was just unlucky.",9 people found this helpful

We have the normal Switch she shares with her brother.  Now they can play independently if they like.  The only downside is more a Nintendo policy, they do not have anything like a family library to share.  As a parent since I purchased the kids games they are linked to my Nintendo account.  Games will have to be repurchased under one of the child accounts in order for both kids to play any game at the same time.  Just so that you are aware of this problem from Nintendo for any family like my own that wanted this as a second Switch.",

Nintendo Switch Lite - Turquoise,2.0,Do not buy from the seller Always Innovating!,"Reviewed in the United States on December 31, 2021",Color: Blue | Style: Lite Console,True,"Do not order from seller Always Innovating!My 10 year old has been asking for a Nintendo Switch Lite for a couple years now, and I got him one for his big present this Christmas. It came half charged- not a problem- and my son started using it right away, because he was so excited about finally getting it. Once the battery ran low, we plugged it in, and realized it wasn't charging. We tried to charge it with my stepson's Nintendo switch cord- nothing. We used my son's cord to test charge my stepson's Nintendo Switch- the cord works, so that means the charging port in the Nintedo Switch Lite my son got, came broken. Okay, time to contact the seller.Once I contacted the seller and explained the situation, they ghosted me. I cannot find a place near me that can fix my son's new Nintendo Switch Lite, and for what I gather, I can send it away and pay $100 plus shipping, handling and insurance in hopes to get it fixed at a repair place. I will probably have to buy my son a new one, which will cost only slightly more than finding a place to repair it and all the fees included.From what I saw, it's awesome. My son played the games and loved it, fun and easy to use, just what he wanted.The seller, Always Innovating, not so much. They sent me an unchargeable Nintendo Switch Lite and then ghosted me when I complained. Not cool! Do not order from Always Innovating!",
Nintendo Switch Lite - Turquoise,5.0,It's a nice system,"Reviewed in the United States on January 26, 2020",Color: Turquoise | Style: Lite Console,True,"I really like the switch lite. I have an original switch as well and honestly I kind of prefer the lite to the original. The lite doesn't dock and connect to the tv but I'm fine with that. I bought one because my wrists don't like supporting weight and my original switch hurt too much when using it in handheld for more than a few minutes. It's much lighter, easier to hold, and is more portable than the original due to it's slightly smaller size/lighter weight.  Setting up a lite if you have a switch already can be confusing, but there are lots of tutorials online and once we got it figured out it wasn't a problem. It's a decent system. I'd recommend it if you plan on traveling a lot with it or don't care about playing on your tv.",

A small symbol indicating a battery needing charge even though the charger was plugged in showed up instead of the home screen. After looking up solutions, the one that worked was holding the power button down for ~12 seconds, then on the next tap of the power button, it should start up. Aside from this, I really enjoy it!",

Nintendo Switch Lite - Turquoise,1.0,Do Not Buy Amazon Refurbished - Buy Your Nintendo Products Elsewhere,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on November 24, 2021",Color: Turquoise | Style: Lite Console,True,"I cannot review the Nintendo Switch Lite as the Amazon Refurbished console was delivered dead on arrival.The product arrived on time, well packaged, and in its original box.  Upon unboxing the Switch itself, numerous visible scratches and gouges on the screen/throughout the product were visible. It was delivered in ""Used - Good"" condition, definitely not ""Refurbished"". I would not have returned the product for these defects alone, however the Switch Lite unit was not capable of powering on. Though I could feel the mild heat generated from charging a few hours, the charge indicator never displayed on the screen nor would the product power on (no sound or on-screen display). I followed the Nintendo and Amazon troubleshooting recommendations with no luck.After nearly an hour with Amazon Customer Support I was told, though they have inventory available, they would not send me a replacement!!! They refused to explain it other than their system wouldn't let them process the replacement and their leadership has informed them to refuse replacements for this product.  My only guess for this horrendous customer treatment would be that the price has gone up between my time of purchase and the time I received the defective product. Overall the Customer Support Reps were kind, but extremely unhelpful.It is clear that this product was not refurbished and never even checked by Amazon to ensure that it functioned as they advertised before shipping. I would suggest steering clear of any Amazon Refurbished products and go with a more reputable retailer that stands by their commitment to customers when purchasing refurbished or used electronics.I could go on and on about the horrible Amazon service and how they are forcing me to pay for my own packaging to ship the games/accessories I bought with the defective Switch console separately (even though Amazon shipped them in one box), but I think you get it.

Nintendo Switch Lite - Turquoise,3.0,"Box was Damaged, Marks on Screen","Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on October 8, 2019",Color: Turquoise | Style: Lite Console,True,"This is my first bad review on Amazon, and it has nothing to do with the device itself. The Switch Lite is an amazing handheld with an enormous library of games. I have been hanging on to my Day One Sony PSVita handheld as long as possible. Now that Sony has officially killed the Vita, I decided to give the Switch a try. I haven't been a fan of Nintendo since the Gameboy days so it's fitting. The console is fast, light, comfortable, and colorful. My complaint is with the box I received. When I buy items from Amazon, shipped by Amazon I expect a new product that looks nice. If this was a gift I would have had to return it. The outer shipping box was in perfect condition so this was boxed up at the warehouse looking like it was stepped on , and not from the delivery driver. The driver was actually really cool. The box was crushed, had holes poked through from being pushed on so hard, there was no seals on the box, the upper portion of the screen has little marks across it too which I will ad a picture later on in an edit. I was definitely not the first person to open the box. Luckily it worked. I will update my review after a few more hours of playing, but so far I am impressed.",One person found this helpful

It's untrue that you can't play games unless connected to the internet.

Nintendo Switch Lite - Turquoise,1.0,Out almost $30,"Reviewed in the United States on August 18, 2022",Color: Turquoise | Style: Lite Console,True,"I ordered the turquoise. Amazon sent me a pink switch. Exchanged that one. Only worked a few weeks then stopped--would not charge or turn on. No, it was not dropped or thrown in a pool.Amazon had me send it to Nintendo for repair. Nintendo sent it back. It worked for two days then stopped working again.Called Amazon and they said they would give a ""FULL"" refund since it had already been repaired once. The e-mail confirmation also said ""FULL"" refund. To me, that means the total of $199.99 I originally paid. When I checked the refund it was about $30 less.I called Amazon and was told it was past the return window. I explained everything above to the person, still no budging on that return fee.So if you receive a defective switch you better figure that out quickly, send it to Nintendo quickly, hope they send it back quickly, and make sure it works before the return window. I asked the customer service rep what the return window is and he didn't answer so you may want to figure out what that is as well before purchasing from Amazon.",2 people found this helpful

This isn't even a drift issue. When I press left, it registers as if it was fighting against me to push right. This started happening in less than two months.If you search youtube, there are plenty of videos of the issue. Some happening in less than a week.I could understand if I was rough with it, dropped it, stepped or sat on it. Although personally, I've treated it more gently than a friend's baby. I mean, I'm almost 40... I know how to take care of electronics and we've been locked down for half the time. It hasn't even left the house. I'm using a case, screen protector, the whole nine.I would be more understanding if Nintendo didn't try to push a product that they knew had defects. Look how long the fought again admitting the drift issue, let alone this.The Lite has the issue is built in to the console, so it's not like you can just send back the joycon and keep on playing games... Oh, and Nintendo isn't accepting warranty work at this time because of Covid-19.tl;dr+ Awesome portable console w/ portability & amazing games on the go...

The Lite is perfect if you're buying for a child or if you're an adult who doesn't spend a ton of time gaming or travels a lot. Both the screen and the sound are good, so it's also perfect if you really don't feel the need to play on your TV and would rather spend less money than buying the regular Switch. I personally feel that Nintendo's games are perfect for handheld platforms so I find this product worth it and enjoy it.If you're more into gaming and know you're going to want to venture outside of Nintendo's platformer games with bigger games and action packed games, I wouldn't buy this if you're going to stick with one console.",

It was working great for awhile until one day I turned it on and the screen went black roughly 3 seconds later. I could still hear it cycling games and responding when I moved the joystick but there was no display. Tried hard resetting it, turning it on and off again, restarting it, Nothing worked. Later that day I used my flashlight on it just on the off chance that the backlight had failed and wouldn't you know I could see ""The sinking city"" again. Went to settings and did a factory reset on it and oddly enough everything worked fine again. Thinking it had been fixed and was just a glitch I didn't bother sending it back before the return date passed. Unfortunately I hadn't used it much since I factory reset it. Now it's October 10th and everytime I adjust the brightness above 60% it shuts off the backlight until I turn the brightness back down and turn the console off and on again. $200 console and $50+ worth of games and It's barely usable. Ouch.Wish I had exchanged it before the return date passed.I would still recommend the switch to anybody. It's a blast to use and refreshing to have a handheld game console again.

Nintendo Switch Lite - Turquoise,2.0,Don't Purchase As A Secondary Device,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on August 14, 2020",Color: Turquoise | Style: Lite Console,True,"I do not like this Switch Lite at all. I bought the original Switch for my oldest son 2 years ago and I bought this Lite for my youngest. He cannot keep his profile on both Switches, he cannot play the digital version games that I purchased on the original and put on the Lite because they were bought under my profile not his. So I either have to go back and forth making each one the ""primary"" for him to play or purchase the same games again. He is not able to use his previously saved game data nor can he play with his brother unless I pay Nintendo for a Nintendo Online account, which I already have under a different email than what I used for the Switch so it won't recognize it. It's been nothing but a huge headache and now he doesn't even want it so I wasted my money.",One person found this helpful

Nintendo Switch Lite - Turquoise,1.0,Completely Defective,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on January 19, 2020",Color: Turquoise | Style: Lite Console,True,"Got it , was really excited about it and quickly found out it was defective. The L trigger button doesn't work and gets jammed.I've sent it in to Nintendo 2 times to get repaired. They claim they did it, replaced the part that was broken. Yet every time I got it back it stopped working less than an 1 hour after I started using itThe thumbsticks also feel loose and maks weird sounds and they don't move in the right wayTo be completely honest. This was an absolute waste of money, it's probably that my switch was a defective or maybe a lemon,  but it's no excuse.  I've waited over a month between repairs and still hasn't been fixed or repaired and they ( Nintendo) refuses to replace my systemI doubt I'll be buying any future Nintendo Products anytime soon, I'm a college student and was really wanting a portable gaming device to take with me around campus.",5 people found this helpful

The joysticks arent as responsive as the original either.

In less than a month my joysticks started to drift and theres no way to fix it so im stuck with a defective device!  The lack of games is the nail in the coffin for me ive played all the “good” games already and passed them,and the ones with multiplayer are mediocre at best. With no good games coming soon to the switch i feel this was a huge waste of money...",6 people found this helpful

Nintendo Switch Lite - Turquoise,4.0,Mini Switch,"Reviewed in the United States on September 20, 2019",Color: Turquoise | Style: Lite Console,False,"Honestly, over the past several years, Nintendo has made the attempt to reestablish itself as one of the most influential video game companies of all time. After the lackluster success of the Wii U, the company needed to restart their engines and showcase a system that appealed to just about anyone. The Switch delivered on that promise. Since the system was released in 2017, it sold over 40 million units worldwide, and brought out a handful of astronomical titles that delivered from the start including Super Mario Odyssey & The Legend Of Zelda: Breath Of The Wild. But over the past few years, Nintendo has overlooked handheld gamers for themselves. Mainly because they have been looking for a new console after Nintendo planned to retire the 3DS & DS legacy that stood for over 15 years in handheld gaming. So, when Nintendo announced they were going to make a handheld version of the Switch, specifically for those whom were disenfranchised from the lackluster days of the 3DS, I was skeptical to see if it would deliver. Well, after trying the handheld version of the Switch, I had some good thoughts, but more that could be added on.The Nintendo Switch Lite is a console that works well at the price-point, catering to those that wanted the Switch to cost less, and didn't want to spend nearly $300 based on a video game system. But that was what made the Switch so special, the ability to place anywhere & at anytime as a hybrid console. The Switch Lite though does work well, for those only handheld gamers, with a few things not included to the original console. The system looks brilliant and streamlines playing titles, specifically in handheld mode. The fact you can play great titles like Super Smash Brothers: Ultimate & Mario Kart 8 Deluxe beautifully, without problems is amazing. You can be able to play nearly all of the Switch games well here, where others you would need certain additions to compensate the lack of being connected to the TV. The controls do work mostly well, and the graphics are just as crisp and vivid as the original console is, and the sound works strongly too.But nevertheless, the Switch Lite does have a few misses here as I had said before. Since you cannot hook the Switch to the TV or dock it like the original, you are limited to playing certain titles specifically in only one mode. The fact that you can only play Super Mario Party & 1,2, Switch in tabletop mode only. You would need a stand specifically for those games, and would also need to purchase joy-con controllers to make those titles work. Not only that, there are other misses here too like the lack of rumble support, which was helpful in some titles for items like Super Mario Odyssey where Mario would get a closer sense to location items to power up the Odyssey ship. But those are mainly small complaints nevertheless, but doesn't take away from the main fun that works for the Switch Lite.Despite a few missed opportunities to deliver, the Switch Lite works well, and delivers a mostly enjoyable experience Switch fans have been celebrating since 2017. What I love about the console is that it works for handheld only gamers, and can connect with playing with others nicely. The Switch Lite is a delight for those that didn't yet get into the original console, but more could've been done to bring out a bigger Switch experience here. For its price, the Switch Lite is a good buy and I do suggest you give it a shot, if you haven't yet had the Switch experience. I had a fun one that was worth the effort.Graphics: A-Sound: B+Control: B 1/2+Fun & Enjoyment: B+",13 people found this helpful

Nintendo Switch Lite - Turquoise,4.0,I love this lil guy! Almost perfect!,"Reviewed in the United States on December 15, 2019",Color: Turquoise | Style: Lite Console,False,"Let me start by saying, I've played my roomie's original Switch for about 2 years. When Pokemon was coming, I knew I had to get my own. I don't even have a TV, so the Lite seemed perfect for me. And now that I have it, I love it! And let me tell you why.Pros:-Feels great in the hands, a solid unit compared to the original Switch, which makes sense because the joy-cons detach on the full size. This feels more akin to a modern mix of a Gameboy and PSP. It's lovely.-The screen is crisper than the full size Switch. Since it's 0.7 inches smaller with the same resolution, everything looks a bit less pixelated. The screen size is the same as an iPhone 6/7/8 Plus, to give you an idea.-It's compact enough to carry in my hoodie pocket comfortably. A pants pocket would be a stretch, though. And I wouldn't recommend that anyway because of the control sticks.-The battery life is solid. I haven't ever run out of power fully. While playing Pokemon Shield, it gets down to 50% in about 2 hours. It sounds short, but who games for 4 hours in a row? My arms would cramp up. And that brings me to my next point,-It charges very quickly. Even when it runs low, I find that it charges from 20 to 90ish percent in an hour. I use my portable battery pack with it, and I can confirm that it still charges while gaming with full brightness and wifi on. So I never have power issues.-The buttons feel fantastic. Having a proper D-Pad is a godsend. It just feels so...correct. The buttons have a nice click without being loud. The L and R buttons have a pleasant curve that makes it feel natural to hold. It's just...good.-The speakers are just fine. I was worried that they would be muffled or sound like crap. They aren't Bose quality, obviously, but they get the job done just fine. I've never felt the need for headphones.Cons:-The screen could still be better. Colors are good, but blacks aren't super deep. It's the same on the original Switch, and it's just a tad disappointing. I know they kept it at 720p for performance and battery, but I can't help wishing it was a full 1080p experience.-It feels a little slippery. The design is lovely, and it feels great in hand. But playing in bed or any way where it's more vertical can be cramp-y. You have to tighten your grip to make sure it doesn't slip, and it weighs on you after a bit. I use the Moko grip case for mine, which also has extra hand grips on the back like an Xbox controller. I recommend that, as it makes it perfect for holding in any position and basically fixes that issue. Still, it's a shame the console isn't a bit grippier.And my biggest gripe: No haptics or vibration. I know it would be tough to incorporate that into a solid console without shaking the whole thing, but it just makes some games less immersive/ more difficult. Some use the ""HD rumble"" to warn you of something, or enhance an intense scene. It's a shame that the Lite misses out on that. I'm confident that Nintendo could figure out how to make that work, but I doubt they will, just to separate the ""Lite"" and ""Premium"" consoles.Cons aside, I love this console! It feels like the quintessential Gameboy, the future version. Big screen, solid buttons, great graphics for a portable... and it's got that Nintendo magic. If you want to play Nintendo games and don't care about connecting to a TV, this is the one to get. I imagine it's great for kids, too. Just make sure to get a case and screen protector, so you don't have to worry about it while traveling!",One person found this helpful

I had both the regular Switch and this console and for my own purposes and interests, I decided to pass on my Switch to my siblings and bought myself a brand new Switch Lite the moment it came out. Sure it might not have HD rumble or detachable joy-cons, and yeah it doesn't connect to a TV screen well, but as a full-time college student who desperately tries to keep up with Pokemon, this was a must-have. I'm out and away from my apartment more often than not and having a small device that 1) fits in any bag I'm wearing, 2) is not heavy as hell on my wrists, and 3) is on the cheaper side is a miracle in that of itself. The Switch Lite works exactly as my normal Switch did and, as an added bonus for being a little smaller and a little less dense, has just a little bit more battery life than the normal console. Also, I must say that these Switch Lite colors are way more appealing to me than some of the Switch colors.I'm no hardcore gamer or collecter, so I see no need to spend an extra $100 on features that I won't even get around to using or will even remember exist. I play on long bus rides to school, while I'm waiting for classes to start, or in the comfort of my bed. If you're thinking of buying the Switch Lite just to collect or to use as I would then sure! Yes! Go for it! If you're thinking about buying the Lite as a device to switch back and forth between this and a regular Switch... I'd highly advise against it.The Switch lite is purely for casual gameplay and for convenience, so don't buy it knowing fully well that's what its for and then complain that it doesn't ""work as well"" as the regular Switch.

Only downside is heavy text games become almost unplayable due to its smaller 5.5” screen.

The first time I ever laid my hands on a switch was when my brother got his and I played through and finished Zelda Breath of the Wild and played Mario Odyssey, Links Awakening, Super Mash Brothers, and Mario Kart 8, and then it was announced Nintendo would be releasing a Switch Lite. I got the Turquoise Switch Lite and the Zelda Breath of the Wild leather Case. I was given Spyro the Dragon Trilogy which I remembered from the time we owned a PS Console, and I got Mario Maker 2 and Luigis Mansion (which I finished the entire game and it was the coolest). Only downfall is when you want to download games it takes awhile😭 and the battery life dies out but it does charge quickly and it comes with a plug in charger. Also love the fact that you can sign up for an account to play a full library of Nintendo and Super Nintendo games which I have 🙆🙋😻 Can't wait for Zelda Breath of the Wild 2. And I do hope they can continue to crossover more games from PlayStation over to Nintendo Switch like Call of Duty and Madden Football 😔 You can play against other players online. It's the best.",

Nintendo Switch Lite - Turquoise,5.0,Important info: “YOU CAN” Merge Bought Games!!!!,"Reviewed in the United States on May 10, 2020",Color: Coral | Style: Lite Console,False,"Please don’t let prior post sway you. First of all, I got the turquoise one for my son’s birthday last week via Target. It’s $100.00 less than what is being advertised on Amazon. If your paying $300.00 for this lite your nuts! This is a down graded handheld gaming system vs the Nintendo Switch Console which is why it retails for $199.99. Secondly, “YOU CAN” merge games you’ve bought for your Nintendo Switch to the Nintendo Lite. All you have to do is log-in with your regular Nintendo account info and sync all your bought games to the lite. The profile you have on your Nintendo Switch Console will be merged onto the lite. I had the same issue, my son got the Nintendo Switch console a year ago and broke the screen. This is a replacement until it and the DS2 can be fixed. You can call Nintendo and they will walk you right through it if you need help. If you’re not a computer or game savvy person you wouldn’t have known this. You can also look at eBay for switch lite. I recent purchased another one on there in yellow from a reputable seller for $199.99 because Target was sold out this past weekend. Keep you eye on Target or eBay.",

As a 20 something homebody, this has easily been the best purchase I've made in a while. I opted for the Lite over the original because I didn't plan on any local multiplayer and I liked the idea of something easy and portable since I have quite a bit of downtime as a freelancer (plus the yellow was really cute).I haven't owned a portable game system since the DS Lite and this little guy is everything I could have asked for. The screen is big, its comfortable to hold and easy to control, but most importantly it has SO MANY GAMES. 3 weeks into social distancing I've been able to play the big titles like Breath of the Wild, revisited old favorites like Skyrim, and found a whole mess of fun indie titles for like 10 bucks a pop! Plus, no more annoying game cards since you can purchase them all digitally. I went ahead and splurged on an SD and I'm already looking into skins and accessories because this thing has become my new favorite time killer. Its a must have!",

This review is mainly on the switch itself. It is portable and reliable. You have a big library of games to choose from. Physical and digital. You can play a digital game on more than one switch but there is a catch to this. One switch will be truly portable ( main switch) while the 2nd switch (secondary switch) will have to have a internet connection in order to play digital game. And the account that bought the digital game will have to be on both switches, but a secondary account can play the game. You just have to link the switches together. Google this process. I did this with me and my sons switches. So I buy the games on my account and made his switch the primary switch and mine secondary. So he doesn't need internet to play while I do. All that being said, please don't buy these from these scum bags. Regular switch is 300 and switch lite is 200. Don't buy from these price gougers on here and encourage this.

After a few months I stopped playing the switch docked and only played handheld so it made more sense to me to have a system that was, as advertised, a smaller more convenient version of the original. As for some of the reviews, I DID read what Nintendo said, which has been widely available since the switch came out, that you CAN NOT play the same game on multiple devices at the same time just because you “already bought a copy” under one account. This is not new. If you did not know beforehand then I’m sorry but you forgot what kind of company Nintendo is.

After I had the Switch for awhile I actually bought the 2DS XL because I wanted something portable, and I know it is old, but the graphics are atrocious and I hate the two screens.

This will only last until they turn 18 I believe, but it should work so you won't have to buy multiple copies of one game.Here's a little guide on this:Log into the primary account on Switch A, the main Switch system. Use this account to purchase and download games.Create a secondary account tied to the primary, and use it to log into Switch B. From there, games can downloaded by going through the Switch eShop and using the re-download option.Finally, create a second (and separate) user account on Switch A. This account can be used to play the games downloaded by the primary account, but is otherwise not created as a primary or secondary account.With this method, one user can play games on Switch A while another can use the secondary account to play games on Switch B. However, if the primary and secondary user try to play the same game simultaneously, the secondary user will be kicked offline. This is the reason for the third account, which can run the games tied to Switch A without kicking secondary user on Switch B offline.",9 people found this helpful

Can someone please make a portable game console that isn't 11 -15 years old that actually is practical to always have in your pocket? There are tons of android game controllers, but those dont fit in pockets either. The last portable game console was the psp go. Before that, the gameboy micro. That is about it as far as truely pocket friendly game consoles. The vita and new 3ds are really pushing it as far as being practical to always have in your pockets. They just are a little bit too heavy and big. Then this, the switch lite, is even heavier and bigger than those last gen options which were already too heavy and big. I guess I'll keep sticking with my psp go for now.If you don't care about portability, i.e. size and weight, just get a regular switch. I just don't get this product, sorry. Do you really need to save $50 to lose a bunch of features and neither device is practical for your pocket?",

You will be sacrificing certain games that either won’t work or are impractical for not being able to connect to a tv or have joycons. It still seems to have the fragile Switch design, which is sad because every product before was absolutely bulletproof. This has a sleek screen but you are going to worry about damaging it (never happened to me but I feel like you have to be way too careful than you should be with a portable system). But my biggest gripe of this is the AC adapter which is huge and weighs probably more than the system itself. It won’t fit in my official Nintendo case and given it’s supposed to have only 6 hours of juice (which is better but far from good) you are going to need to lug it around with you.",6 people found this helpful

If the main account connects anywhere else the lite gets disconnected and can’t play. The whole reason I got it was so my youngest could play but only with downloaded games no cartridges because they would be more likely to take them out and lose them. So now I have to spend hundreds more to get more?! Even though I just spent 600$ to get this game, joy con and two more digital games ?! Nintendo should be ashamed.",

Nintendo Switch Lite - Turquoise,1.0,Huge software issue by Nintendo if this is your secondary console!!,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on October 16, 2019",Color: Turquoise | Style: Lite Console,False,"If you are purchasing this as your secondary Nintendo switch or share games between family members, you'll be very disappointed.Sharing digital games between multiple systems sucks. You can set one console as your primary, allowing you to play games anywhere without an internet connection. But to play digital titles on secondary systems, you'll have to be connected to the internet and it's also authenticated every three hours. Even worse, you can only play games through the account that originally purchased them. That's a problem for families where one parent account typically buys digital games.The Switch is meant to be portable. I ended up having to make it my primary system to play digital games on the go. But that also meant my original Switch was basically trapped on the dock under my TV. I was forced to restart progress on games that don't support the Switch Online's cloud saves.Family members wouldn't be able to play anything on the docked Switch on their own accounts. They'd be forced to play under my username, which could be a problem when it comes to managing saved games. And, worst of all, they wouldn't be able to play any of my digital games on that system offline.While multi-Switch households could swap around physical game carts, that introduces a whole new set of problems, especially with kids. Physical games can easily be lost or damaged, and you'll also have to be more mindful about trading games between systems. That's particularly true with the Switch, since each system might be traveling with a different person, instead of being set up throughout your home. Carts are also just annoying to plug in -- sure, that just takes a few seconds, but it's not nearly as seamless as booting up a digital game.The biggest problem with limiting yourself to carts? It's kind of impossible on the Switch, since it has a robust library of indie titles that are only available digitally. As much as I'd love to see a cart for Untitled Goose Game, it's not worth waiting around to see if one ever appears. Digital games are basically an inescapable problem for every Switch owner.",4 people found this helpful
Nintendo Switch Lite - Turquoise,2.0,Only for a casual switch fan,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on May 31, 2020",Color: Turquoise | Style: Lite Console,False,"While I may not have purchased this product, I have done my research on the system to get a valid point on this mini console. Starting off with the retail price of $200 is too much if you want to be able to enjoy the switch library. What I mean by this is that the switch light doesn’t have the detachable controllers (joycons) that many games NEED to be able to play. An example of this would be just dance or super Mario party. A pair of joycons is roughly $80 and then you have to buy a joycons charger for them because the lite can’t charge them so your looking at around $310. At that price you should have just spent the money on a regular switch that is superior to the lite in almost all ways. That being said, the switch lite is good for kids that want to play one or two games on a switch. If you wanted to fully dive into the switch library then I would suggest a regular switch because it is still portable and it can connect to the tv ( lite’s can’t do that) and it has better battery life. My final problem is about the joysticks on the switch lite and the regular switch’s joycons. After a while of use, the joysticks start to drift ( move without any input) witch can really damper someone’s experience with a game. Nintendo offers free repairs in certain parts of the US but if this happens with the lite ( it will happen eventually) you would have to send in the entire console just to get the joysticks fixed! Overall I feel like this console is good for people who want to play a few games on the switch that don’t care about seeing them on a tv.",
Nintendo Switch Lite - Turquoise,1.0,"Awesome console, awful, draconian DRM","Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on March 3, 2020",Color: Turquoise | Style: Lite Console,False,"Getting this as your only switch? Have fun - it's cute, it's light, it's absolutely fine. Most/all of your games are physical? Enjoy!Getting this as a second Switch? Unless you're going on a purely physical games route DON'T DO IT. I can't stress this enough. Honestly, I thought the naysayers are over-exaggerating and it couldn't be that bad, right? Wrong. It's much worse than expected:The DRM is quite draconian and requires an Internet check for every single E-Shop game, and a constant connection throughout your gaming session. Worse still, I have multiple accounts which I buy from, so I'm forced to try and remember the exact account which I bought the specific game from otherwise the game won't even start. The process goes like that:""Hmm, I feel like a bit Binding of Isaac this evening. Where did I put the Lite? Ah, here it is. Connect it, run the game, the check takes a few seconds...nope, that's not the account that bought it. Was it that account?....Still nope. I could have sworn it was on this account! No? Damn it, which account was it?!"" If this was just a few games it wouldn't be that big of an issue. I have about 60 digital games spread over 8 different accounts downloaded to 1TB SD Card. I hope you see the problem here.But do you think that's end of it? It goes even lower than that: I sometimes bought games on one account, and their DLC on another. This means that I can't play these games with their respective DLC's unless I buy either the game or its DLC's again on one, specific account. The Lite feels like an expensive brick now.This is a shameful, completely customer unfriendly attitude by Nintendo, and no amount of apologetic brown-nosing fan service will change that. We're being treated like thieves for legitimately buying digital games. I'm being forced to purchase physical from now on if I want to play properly, but I'm having a hard time even justifying buying more games at this point.You have been warned.",One person found this helpful
Nintendo Switch Lite - Turquoise,1.0,Dreaded joy con drift!,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on February 19, 2020",Color: Turquoise | Style: Lite Console,False,"This switch lite was purchased from Amazon as a Christmas gift.  It wasn't put into use until mid January.  About a week ago the joy stick started to malfunction.  It's intermittent, sometimes starting right away, sometimes not starting till you're playing about 20 minutes. Sometimes it's not too bad,  and sometimes you can't even control the character which is horrible. Called Nintendo couple of days ago and the man emailed me a return label.  They are not even fixing the joycons on the original switch, just sending replacements.  He did say that because it's a switch lite they would try to fix it, but they might have to replace it.  It's the Pokemon special edition version and he said they would NOT be able to replace it with that version.  That's the first issue.  Another issue is that it has 2 large unfinished game saves, Links Awakening and Pokemon Sword. They're saved on the internal memory of the hardware (why oh why can't we save on an sd card,  Nintendo.  Oh that's right we're supposed to buy cloud service for saved games,  but wait,  Pokemon can't be saved on Nintendo online service)  so if they have to send a replacement machine what happens to all the saved data? He said they would certainly try to port the data to the replacement switch,  but he really didn't make any promises. Great.  So now what to do?  Maybe forget sending it back and just buy a different controller. That certainly makes the lite less portable.  And shouldn't your hardware just work? I would really like Nintendo to solve this problem but I'm very concerned about sending it back to them. The switch lite seems like a great idea but because of this joycon problem I cannot recommend it at all.  If you do buy it, put it thru it's paces right away so you can return it if yours develops the issue.  But who's to say this problem wouldn't happen as soon as your return window closes.",One person found this helpful

Nintendo Switch Lite - Turquoise,4.0,Good price on a mobile game system,"Reviewed in the United States on October 4, 2020",Color: Turquoise | Style: Lite Console,False,I love this system but I gave it four stars because I cannot play any of my downloaded games away from home and also the battery life could definitely be better than a couple of hours! Other than that be prepared to bring all physical games with you that you want to play while on the go because without internet that’s all you’ll be able to do! Great system for kids who can read though as long as they take care of their things and don’t lose every game you buy them or the charger to the system! I definitely recommend this system because you can pretty much play every game made but only a few that require the motion feature and detachable joy cons that only the regular switch can do! Good enough for me minus the small complaints mentioned above! I really wish they’d fix the not being able to play downloaded games without internet on the go because it really can limit you! I have 18 downloaded games,

Nintendo Switch Lite - Turquoise,5.0,So happy!!!,"Reviewed in the United States on September 13, 2020",Color: Coral | Style: Lite Console,True,I have the original switch which is great but not very portable the joy cons are easily messed up if not carful so when Nintendo came out with the new coral switch lite I had to get it! The seller was amazing the day I put in the order I got it delivered the very next day! It came brand new with everything I’m so happy with it. The only down side is that if you Plan to connect this lite switch to any other switch you have to get permission from the original switch to play the downloadable content any time you open up the game but lucky for me most of my games are cartridges. I highly recommend it but if you are a family with kids and want multiple switches connected to the same account you’ll need to invest in cartridge games.,

For someone who just wants to play Mario Kart and Animal Crossing, it was perfect for me. I would recommend purchasing a MicroSD card right away, as the device does not have a lot of storage and was filled after downloading a few games.

Nintendo Switch Lite - Turquoise,5.0,Happy with my purchase!,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on September 15, 2022",Color: Coral | Style: Lite Console,True,"My boyfriend bought me a switch! I had no problem with it but you should know a few things before buying. If you’re buying the switch to play with friends or your partner (which is what I did), you have to pay for online. Which is not that bad, I paid $8 for 3 months. You also don’t have to go out of your way to buy the games before receiving it (which is what I did lol). There’s an E-store where you can buy every single game. I prefer that option so you don’t have to look and worry to see if it’s compatible with switch lite. They also got free games if you can afford none. The only down side is that it did took a while to download. By the time I got out the shower, only one game downloaded. The audio kinda sucks ngl. I’m playing minecraft and (full volume) I could barely hear the music, and I love peaceful minecraft music so that sucks. Also get ready to sign in to every game you have!This other part is about Amazon,When I bought it, the next day Amazon refunded my money and canceled the order which was very weird but I didn’t say much about it. Two days later they took the money again. The delivery took forever! By the time it was delivered to the lockers, it was 8pm. I still got my items so it doesn’t matter.",

Nintendo Switch Lite - Turquoise,4.0,For The Kid Inside of You,"Reviewed in the United States on May 23, 2020",Color: Turquoise | Style: Lite Console,False,"As a disclaimer, I did not buy this from Amazon. Please do not pay more than the retail price of 199.99. I am a 41-year-old woman and I have a soft spot for Nintendo games, Mario, Zelda, Fire Emblem, etc. I did not get a regular Switch. I just got this, I did not want to hook this up to my TV, and I play solo anyway so I did not see the point of spending an extra $100 dollars. Some games are better played with a controller than on the unit itself. I love the color, it's more of a green than a blue. I suggest you get a case for it as well, I bought the official switch lite carry case from Nintendo. Also if you don't want to play the unit laying flat you can get a playing stand. See the pictures above for the accessories that I purchased.  My only complaints are that the charger is too big and also there is not enough internal storage, you need to get a micro SD card, I suggest a minimum of 128gb since some games are getting harder to find and some are download only. I'm more of a casual player as for families if you have children and if they don't mind sharing this could work or if you just have one child, if not than the regular switch might be better. This system is really fun to play with.",

Nintendo Switch Lite - Turquoise,5.0,"Great system, Downloadable Content Works Fine without WiFi","Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on May 29, 2021",Color: Blue | Style: Lite Console,False,"Someone on here said that you can’t use downloadable games on the Switch lite without the internet. This same person seemed pretty upset, using hyperbole and all caps. Except what they said is not true. In fact, you just set your switch lite to be your primary system, and the regular Switch can be the one that checks to make sure about said digital content. Nintendo is protecting themselves again possible misuse and piracy. I have this setup for myself, and I don’t have to think twice. Keep in mind Nintendo is constantly updating the Switch OS, so if they can change it without compromising their IP rights, I’m sure they will.I love my Switch lite, but it’s not for everyone. Most people will want one mainly as a second system. For portable use only. And it’s one of the most comfortable, affordable portable gaming systems Nintendo has ever made. No gimmicks, just great design, and a good price ($179.99 seems like a better price point. Or have a pack in game). Can’t wait to play Metroid Prime 4 and Breath of the Wild 2 on my lite later this year.",One person found this helpful

Nintendo Switch Lite - Turquoise,5.0,Love it,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on July 5, 2020",Color: Turquoise | Style: Lite Console,True,The Nintendo switch is great system. I recommended the switch lite to anybody who does not plan to play on a television. Overall it seems better for on the go usage. You save 100$ but lose the ability to play your switch on a TV.The battery life is better than the original switch but worse than the improved one. It's easier to carry around and you will not have issues with the joycons disconnecting.,

Of course, this's going bye-bye the moment I can get me a Steam Deck (lol!)",
