Kindle Oasis ‚Äì With 7‚Äù display and page turn buttons,3.0,From 2014 Paperwhite to 2019 Oasis,"Reviewed in the United States üá∫üá∏ on August 9, 2019",Digital Storage Capacity: 8 GB | Offer Type: Lockscreen Ad-Supported | Color: Graphite | Option: Without Kindle Unlimited,True,"So I've been using a Kindle Paperwhite since 2014 and absolutely loved it.  Despite it being five years old, it still worked great and has been a pleasure as a reading device.  I've been debating the idea of upgrading to a new Kindle for a few months- and a few weeks ago Amazon had a really nice deal that allowed you to trade in your old Kindle for twenty-five bucks AND get 25% off the purchase of a new Kindle.  So, despite the fact that my old Paperwhite worked just fine, I decided to upgrade to the brand new 2019 Kindle Oasis.  I liked the idea of the color-changing LEDs for nighttime reading plus the benefit of having it be waterproof for when I read at the beach.  I placed my order and shipped my old Kindle back to Amazon.I've been reading with my new Kindle for about two weeks, and my reactions have been mixed.  In some ways, the Kindle Oasis is definitely an upgrade over my old Paperwhite.  In other ways, it seems like Amazon swayed too far from the formula of what makes their e-readers great.  For the sake of this review, I'll be comparing the performance of the new 2019 Oasis to my old Paperwhite. I'll also make comments about how the Oasis compares against the current Paperwhite, which is likely a much better option for the vast majority of people seeking an e-reader.  It should be noted that I also ordered Amazon's nice Merlot leather cover... I'll review that too.Battery Life:Some people have complained about the battery life of the new Kindle Oasis.  I'll say that the battery definitely doesn't last as long as a Paperwhite.  My old Paperwhite's battery was still excellent, even at five years old.  My old Paperwhite had to be charged every 5-6 weeks based on my use.  After two weeks of reading, my Oasis's battery says that it's at 52%.  It's not a big difference, but it is noticeably less than the much cheaper Paperwhite.  (That said, I think the larger screen that likely consumes more battery life is well worth the fact that I'll have to charge it every four weeks verses six for the Paperwhite)  For the price premium, it would have been nice if Amazon included a battery that held a charge at least as long as the Paperwhite though.The LEDs and Night Mode:This is perhaps the best upgrade between my old Paperwhite and the new Oasis.  I often read before bed- and tend to do so with the lights off so that my wife can sleep.  With my old Paperwhite, the blue-hue LEDs were not easy on my eyes when reading in the dark.  That has all changed with the Oasis and it's night mode.  It allows you to change the LEDs from a blue hue to a yellowish hue that makes it a lot more comfortable to read in the dark.  I LOVE this feature and might even argue that the price premium of the Oasis is worth it just for that feature.  It's fully customizable so that you can find the color/hue that works best for you.  You can also schedule it so that it automatically switches at a certain time.  That's handy, even though it only takes about five seconds to switch it manually.Speaking of the LEDs, there is one feature that drives me nuts about the Kindle Oasis.  The auto brightness feature is extremely annoying.  It's extremely sensitive and seems to constantly auto adjust even when the room's lighting is consistent.  Over the first few hours of reading in my dining room, the auto brightness consistently changed over and over again ever thirty seconds or so- which is extremely annoying when you are trying to read.  My solution was to just turn off the auto-brightness setting.  To me, this is inexcusable in a premium e-reader.  My 2014 Paperwhite's auto brightness setting worked fine.  Somehow with all the extra features and new design, Amazon made this feature less user-friendly in the Oasis.Comfort / Basis Design:Okay- this is purely a subjective topic- but I think that the overall design of the Kindle Oasis is far inferior to the Paperwhite.  The fact that there is a large bump-out on the back for the battery along one side means that the Kindle is not balanced in your hand as you read.  My old Paperwhite- and the current one for that matter- was 100% balanced when held in one hand.  The Oasis isn't balanced- which means that as I read, I'm frequently distracted by the fact that the devide is leaning to one side or the other, depending on orientation.  To add to this issue, the Oasis seems to be a lot heavier than my old Paperwhite.Response / Screen Response / Display:This is something that is, for the most part, is vastly superior compared to my old Paperwhite.  The touch response of the Oasis is lightning fast in terms of page turns, when you are browsing your library, or looking for a new book in the Kindle Store.  There is one exception: It's annoyingly slow when you first unlock it and have to slide your finger along the bottom.  In terms of the display quality- it's crystal clear, crisp, and impressive for an e-reader.  The larger 7"" display might not seem like a large upgrade over the Paperwhite's 6"" display- but its makes a big difference if you use your Kindle regularly.  Now that I'm used to a 7"" screen, the Paperwhite's smaller display seems tiny- even though it worked just fine for me for five years before I upgraded.  Lastly, the page turn buttons are user-friendly and well-designed.  You can also use the touchscreen to turn the pages, but I found that the buttons were more comfortable to use.Inexcusable Drawbacks:First, you get a charger cable, but not the wall outlet adapter... Considering that you're buying a premium e-reader, that's just ridiculous.  You shouldn't have to pay an extra twenty bucks to buy this- it should be included.  Seriously, how much more could those little chargers cost Amazon to include?  Second, I understand the advertising on the cheaper Paperwhite.  Why must I pay an additional twenty bucks to avoid ads on a two hundred and fifty dollar e-reader?  Really- the fact that these two things cost extra is inexcusable.Lastly, I want to comment about the Merlot Leather Cover that Amazon sells.  This isn't a review on the cover, but a comment about how the design of the Oasis really makes it hard to design a decent cover.  I debated on whether or not I should buy it or if it was even worth the price that Amazon wants for it- but decided to go for it considering that I'll probably keep this e-reader for five years or so before upgrading again.  That said, I really don't like it because it doesn't fit the Oasis very well.  Sure, the Oasis fits snugly into the case, but when you open it and fold the cover back, the binding isn't tight so it flexes and moves a little as you read.  In addition, because of the Oasis's battery notch in the back, there is a 1/4"" gap between the front cover and the actual Oasis for about 60% of the Kindle back.  The causes the binding to shift even more- which is annoying.  This never was a problem for my Amazon-brand Paperwhite case from 2014.  Again- this is likely more due to the design of the Oasis than the design of the cover.Overall, you really need to consider if the Oasis is worth spending twice as much as a Paperwhite.  If you read A LOT and would benefit from the LEDs that change from blueish to yellowish, then the Oasis might be worth it for you.  If you don't really care about the color-changing LEDs, then the Paperwhite is likely the better option.  Most of the best features of the Oasis can be found in the current Paperwhite.  They both are waterproof, they both have great displays, they both have bluetooth audio capability, and they both have great battery life (the Paperwhite is likely even better than the Oasis).  Unless you are a serious daily reader- or can take advantage of a deal like I did, the Paperwhite is likely the e-reader that makes more sense.","1,518 people found this helpful"
Kindle Oasis ‚Äì With 7‚Äù display and page turn buttons,4.0,Overall Wonderful Despite a Handful of Frustrations,"Reviewed in the United States üá∫üá∏ on May 13, 2021",Digital Storage Capacity: 32 GB | Offer Type: Lockscreen Ad-Supported | Color: Champagne Gold | Option: Without Kindle Unlimited,True,"Before I start this review, I just want to say that I adore this e-reader regardless of any negative feedback. In fact, I took it over to show my mother and she loved it so much she got one for herself. For both of us, trying to read on a tablet for longer periods of time just isn't enjoyable. This is the first e-reader purchase for both of us after many years though I have had occasion to play with the newer generation of paperwhite/kindle in person before making this purchase.First things first - this device uses E-Ink. It works by having a multitude of microcapsules that when charged display either black or white. Just from that description alone, it's pretty obvious why this has no color, though color is in the works by the E-Ink developer, it's just years away from being workable on these types of devices. Obviously, this works differently than a tablet and its main purpose, as with all e-readers, is to give a good reading experience and mimic a page of a book as best as possible while also being easier on the eyes.Display: Very, very sharp on the Oasis. It's lovely to look at and I have found zero ghosting while reading.  It's clear and crisp. While only an inch, the benefits of the 7 inch are noticeable but hard to explain outside of it just feels better reading-wise. The screen is matte and while not glare-proof it helps a good deal and the pages are lovely to look at.Touch: Very responsive. Again, due to the tech of this product, it's kind of a wonder we have touchscreens with them. It's very responsive for an e-reader, more than any other that I've looked at. I can't say I was all that impressed with the Paperwhite's touch screen as it seemed to get finicky at times and could turn multiple pages on you, a problem I've not had with any other device. While sometimes it doesn't always register the touch, for the most part, it does, and highlighting, accessing the menu, shopping in the store, etc. have all been easy. Sometimes it doesn't register when scrolling but that's been the biggest issue encountered so far.Page Turning - I am partial to the buttons and am a believer that these devices should come with them baseline. However, buttons or touch, the pages turn fast, fluid, and cleanly with close to no delay whatsoever.Screen Brightness - The warm light is great and is the other reason I got this model over a Paperwhite (buttons were the other). I have issues with my eyes where blue light really bothers me. Not only does the Oasis seem to have less blue light in general compared to Paperwhite/Kindle/Older Oasis models, but the warm light works well. It doesn't take a lot to solve the issue and being able to adjust brightness and warmth separately is good. You are able to set the warmth to auto-activate from sunset to sunrise based on time zone, set your own time, or do it anytime easily.Options: There are many ways to change the layout from font style, boldness, and size. I haven't seen it really mentioned, but you can set it horizontal also. Yes, you do need to go through settings to do this but given how this device works, that's not a surprise. There is a feature to save all your layouts so it's simple enough to hit the saved format for horizontal to switch to that or back again to vertical. The buttons come default as up = forward down = back, but these can be reversed. There is no scrolling option but I'm not someone who likes that when reading books, but keep that in mind, especially for certain media like comics/manga. You are able to have it display page numbers, the clock, percentage left/read, or none of the above.Personal Library Access - Amazon, for the love of all creation fix this mess. I knew going in that it would be a pita but still. Even after going through each book and adding them separately back into their collections I still can't sort by them. I don't know what I did wrong but it's been a frustrating endeavor, and the inability to really have decent sort options can make it a pain for those who want to keep the library on this device instead of just a book or two at a time. Fortunately, the search works well but I shouldn't have to look one of my Fires to sort through my library and then bring it up on the Oasis. That's terrible and to my understanding has been a longstanding problem.Wifi - I had no problems with accessing the Kindle store to browse or purchase books. This is probably the biggest area that had a delay, lack of sensitivity to input, and a large amount of screen refreshing, but again, given what it is, it wasn't an issue really. Wifi does drain the battery (even more so if downloading a lot of books, like at the start and it does give a warning for this) but that is a problem on most modern devices. I wish there was a battery saver option for this like there is for the Fire's as I would like to use the Translation feature at times while reading some books and that is only available via wifi. Fortunately, the dictionary is not so dependent.Battery Life - The Kindle base model has 4 LEDs, the Paperwhite has 6. The Oasis - 25. That's a lot of LEDs (12 for white, 13 for the warm lighting system) and it is understandable that while in use this isn't going to have as long of a life as other models, especially older ones that don't have a backlight at all. When indoors, I tend to have everything set to as close to zero as possible as personal preference and would say that depending on reading habits you're looking at charging every few days to a little over a week. I would also say that one should never believe any company's rhetoric on battery life - it's usually under the most minimal of conditions. That being said, if you're coming from an older model of Kindle, especially the really early ones, you aren't going to get the same battery life due to the LEDs but it isn't as terrible as a tablet, for example. It does hibernate after a period of inactivity and takes a few seconds to wake back up when starting again. This isn't a bad thing to me but has been off-putting to others with the slight delay.The Micro USB - I know this a point of contention with a lot of people but I didn't find it that big of a deal. I still have several devices include Kindles/Fires that use this. I would assume that when Amazon does make the switch to USB C that they want to ensure all their tablets/Kindles can make the switch over.Shape - I love it. The only thing I can think of is that it would be nice if the metal was grooved a little in a couple of places on the back to help with a firmer grip and to reduce sliding potential. Otherwise, it's lovely to both me and my mother - easy to hold, easy to operate the buttons, etc.Waterproofing - I can't speak to how this works and hope to never have to.The Ads - Amazon, we are buying your top-of-the-line product. We should not have to pay you more to not have you advertise at us, especially since you have a recommended for you on the homepage that does the job somewhat better. When Kindles/Fires were launching way back when it did make some sense as the price difference was $40 and made the lower-end models especially more accessible to a wider range of people. But now, it's just gross. Yes, I have the one with the ads because I cannot justify giving you an extra $20 for something that is top of the line and already highly priced.The Price - So, this is really expensive. There is an option to do payment plans on it, which is nice, but it's still pricy. If you have an e-reader that at least is functional, it might do for you to wait until Prime Day or Cyber Monday to get a deal and shave off $50-75. Is it worth it? That depends. If you're like me and need the warm light then this is the only Kindle that has it, along with the buttons. I look at it as an investment. The products I have gotten from Amazon have lasted years. On top of that, I am a reader and have been looking for something that would allow me to access my Kindle library easily while having the features I needed/wanted. If you're not reading a whole lot and/or do not need the buttons/warm light then this probably isn't the Kindle for you. Personally, I knew I would not be happy with the Paperwhite, and while there are things I dislike about the Oasis, as a whole I am happy that I own this.Probably the biggest question to ask yourself before spending this kind of money is how much do you read and/or were you someone who used to read a lot? The biggest question is whether one will use it enough to justify having a device that is only for reading and if the features for them personally justify the purchase. For me, yes, for others, it may be a different answer.I listened to and read many reviews on the Oasis and other Kindles and one of the comments was that with the Oasis that one might spend more money due to just buying more books to read. I can see that. It's a joy to read on this.",523 people found this helpful
Kindle Oasis ‚Äì With 7‚Äù display and page turn buttons,5.0,"Love it!  Read how to save 25%, plus free perks and customizable buttons","Reviewed in the United States üá∫üá∏ on July 30, 2019",Digital Storage Capacity: 8 GB | Offer Type: Lockscreen Ad-Supported | Color: Graphite | Option: Without Kindle Unlimited,True,"¬†I decided to finally upgrade my Kindle from the first Paperwhite when I found out I could get a 25% discount and a $5 Amazon gift card for trading in my very old and unused Kindle Keyboard 1st gen, as well as other bonuses of 6 months free Kindle Unlimited (approx $60) plus a 30 day Audible trial.I‚Äôm very happy with it and it has some great features.I do like the adjustable amber tint, but I also really like the ability to invert the colors to white print on a black background.  This is even easier on the eyes, but it does have a noticeable (and irritating) white flash every few page turns when using the buttons, and almost with every page turn when advancing with the touch screen.  I believe this is the e-ink refreshing.  I will probably use the black inverted color only when I‚Äôm reading outside in bright sunlight.I also am really happy to have buttons to turn the page again.  It‚Äôs the ultimate laziness to be able to just keep your thumb in the button and depress it to turn the page instead of having to actually move your thumb a half inch to touch the screen, but hey, why move a half inch when your can push down 1/16th of an inch?  All that extra movement add up over the years.The real reason I like the buttons is this: I live in Alaska and we have very long, cold nights.  But even in the winter, we turn down the heat at night.  I read in bed every single night, tucked all cozy and warm under my down comforter... except for having to have my hand out in order to touch the screen on my Paperwhite to turn the page.  My hand starts to get very cold.  It‚Äôs uncomfortable.  My half frozen hand takes away from my happy bedtime reading experience.  With the Oasis, I can keep my hand under the blankets and just push the button.  You don‚Äôt know what a big deal this is until you spend night after night with a frozen hand.I also like that you can select which button to the the page advance button and which is the page back button.  The Oasis comes set up with the top button as the page advance and the bottom as the page back, but I switched them: the bottom is the advance, the top is the back.  I hold my ereaders at the bottom sides, and had to stretch my thumb to advance the page when it was set for the top button.  It‚Äôs just easier and more comfortable to use the bottom button.  And this is cool: the bottom button stays as my page advance button even when I rotate the Oasis 180 to use left handed!!  Smart!!Others have covered the size and weight so I won‚Äôt go it I all that except to say it‚Äôs comfortable to hold.  I do use the official Amazon Premium leather cover and it fits perfectly, and the magnetic closure/sleep/wake functions work perfectly also.Dislike:  Nothing with the ereader itself, but with however Amazon picks the ‚Äúspecial offers‚Äù.  From what I read, these offers are supposed to be tailored off of a person‚Äôs reading history/preferences.  I may be wrong.The books they are featuring for me are ‚Äúromance‚Äù genre.  I am sooo not a romance genre girl.  I don‚Äôt believe I‚Äôve ever purchased this genre in my life. I‚Äôm a hardcore sci-fi/dystopian. I have an adverse reaction when I see romance special offer.Other than that, some of the complaints by others leaves me wondering.I just don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs THAT big of deal that it has a micro usb.  Really, it‚Äôs just not that hard to figure out the big end of the cable from the small end.  As for charging speed, charge mine while I‚Äôm sleeping at night so it doesn‚Äôt matter if it takes 1 hour or 4. I suppose having to carry a micro usb cord and charger  when other devices use a usb-c cord/charger may be annoying but I think I can find 2 square inches in my purse/pocket/bag/backpack for it.Also remember that this is an e-reader.  It‚Äôs not a tablet, computer or smartphone, nor does it make any claims to be.  Expecting an ereader to function basically like a computer/tablet/smartphone is expecting too much.  It does an outstanding job at doing it‚Äôs job as an ereader.I have sent many different type of files to my Paperwhite using my kindle email address and it‚Äôs worked excellent with that old ereader, so I expect this new Oasis will do excellent with those as well.My suggestion is to read the description fully and know what you are getting and what you aren‚Äôt. If your reading experience will be destroyed because this doesn‚Äôt have (nor claim to have) a usb-c, then this isn‚Äôt the ereader for you.If you want it to be like a tablet or smartphone or computer, this isn‚Äôt the ereader for you.But if you love reading and buy this for what it‚Äôs made for, I can recommend it. Definitely look into getting a discount by trading in any unused kindles, and take advantage of the free Kindle Unlimited and Audible while they are available to offset the cost even more.","1,483 people found this helpful"
Kindle Oasis ‚Äì With 7‚Äù display and page turn buttons,5.0,The best e-reader of them all....UPDATE,"Reviewed in the United States üá∫üá∏ on April 7, 2022",Digital Storage Capacity: 8 GB | Offer Type: Lockscreen Ad-Supported | Color: Graphite | Option: Without Kindle Unlimited,True,"UPDATE......As I've used my new Oasis I've found a few things that could be different.........As many reviewers have found, battery life is not up to the older Kindles, but.....since I'm dumping books in manually every few days this is not important to me since it's being recharged often.I've found an oddity with how books are displayed......Some are shown with author first, title second, some are title first, author second.  I've found no reason for this, and it's just ""different"".Since I get books from Amazon and my public library and other sources I'm not sure what's going on with this.Again, I'd like to see the actual book cover, not an icon.I've found that when reading with one hand I occasionally hit SOMETHING on the touch screen and things can change....... Font can change, size of the page can be expanded, and the location in the book can disappear from the bottom of the display.Fortunately, the Oasis offers a screen lock function.My KOBO Libra offered the option of displaying the actual page number.  This would be nice to have in the Oasis.  The Oasis showing the percentage read is not very useful to me, and page numbers make it much easier to find something.As others have stated, the advertising of Amazon on the ad supported Kindle's is getting totally out of hand.MOST of the home screen is nothing but ads, with the library only showing a few books on the top of the home page.  True, you see only your books on the library and list view, but give us a break on the excessive ads.Removing books from the Oasis is ""snakey"".I accidentally erased all my Amazon books off my Amazon account when I removed old books I wanted to keep, but didn't want cluttering up my new Oasis library.I'm going to have to figure this one out, since I don't want to store much on my Oasis but would like to have them secure on my account if I need them again.I know there's a way to securely store my books on the Amazon cloud, but I don't want to use that.When finishing a book a screen is displayed asking for a review.  There's no way to opt out other then to go to the home page.Again, this is just aggravating, but not a major issue.Still like.........The quality of the Oasis is obvious and top of the line.  It feels like and is a piece of quality equipment.Display of text is excellent.Non-smudging screen is great.Lighting is excellent, but will deplete the battery faster if set too high.  To save the battery I turned mine down to the middle, but decided that I'd rather have an easy to read screen then a little less charge life.The bundled ""fabric"" Amazon cover works perfectly and so far seems to be standing up to a lot of handling.Speed of getting back to a book as absolutely great.  Open the cover and swipe and I'm back.This is where Amazon has it all over the other readers like the KOBO, that seem to take forever to power up and get back to the book.So, I still give the Oasis 5 stars.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------I still have a Kindle keyboard reader that's going strong after 11 years.Last year I decided it would eventually fail and I'd certainly gotten my money's worth from it, so I bought a new KOBO Libra.  KOBO is the most popular e-reader in the rest of the world, Amazon is most sold in America and I thought I'd give it a try.That was a disappointment...... it takes forever to get back to the book I'm reading, since it shuts completely down after a set time, even if it's in sleep mode.This requires a lengthy start up, then you have to re-select the book you were reading and re-start that.It has has no way to magnify or expand pictures or maps., and most of those are so tiny they're unusable.The screen shows finger prints badly.I put that down to a bad buy so I just bought a new Kindle Oasis......It's just great and the high cost is worth it for a heavy reader like me.....I read books like most people eat peanuts, at least 3 to 4 hours a night.I bought the bundle of the Oasis, a wall plug, and a waterproof fabric cover.The plug I probably won't use, but the cover is excellent and you get it far cheaper then if you buy the cover separate.  The plug is basically free with the bundle.The new Oasis is everything I'd want in an e-reader and offers everything I want in function.I just got it so I haven't fully road tested it yet but what I see so far, I really like.Battery life seems to be good, but since I dump books into e-readers every few days it's recharging often.The screen shows no finger prints and unlike the KOBO I'm not constantly having to use a cloth to clean it off.The page turn buttons work very well with just the right feel.Screen brightness can be set easily and the e-ink display is very readable.The only complaints are that the owner's manual is slightly different from my new Oasis.Directions don't match up with what I see on the new model and I wish Amazon had updated the manual to avoid confusion and having to hunt for features.Some features in the manual are not available on my new Oasis.Another issue is how the books are displayed on the library view.  For some odd reason my library shows only icons of the book but NOT a picture of the book cover...... except for reasons I can't figure out, ONE book does show as a cover.I'm a visual person and I'd like to see book covers.  I'll try to trouble shoot this issue.So, until I fully wring the new Oasis out, I'm giving it top ratings.",136 people found this helpful
Kindle Oasis ‚Äì With 7‚Äù display and page turn buttons,5.0,I never want to be without my Oasis,"Reviewed in the United States üá∫üá∏ on March 19, 2023",Digital Storage Capacity: 8 GB | Offer Type: Lockscreen Ad-Supported | Color: Graphite | Option: Without Kindle Unlimited,True,"I had one of the first gen Kindles years ago, and after a tragic accident involving a washing machine I wanted to replace it.  I generally like to look at a popular classified add website to see if there were any bargains to be had in my area and sure enough there was a Kindle Oasis for sale. I got it for a deep discount over a new one.  It's been 5 years or so now and I've read dozens of books using it.  And last night I found a paperback in a box that I'd never read, so I started reading it.  Immediately I wished I was using my Oasis.  People always say to me ""I just like reading real books"". I seriously doubt these people have spent any appreciable amount of time with a Kindle e-reader.  I'm in my 50's and reading glasses are always within reach by necessity and light is now an important factor in pretty much anything I do.  With the paperback, I was wishing the font was a little bigger, even with my reading glasses and in bed with my desk lamp the light was too dim.  But with my Oasis, the font size is always just right, because I can adjust it and no matter what the light, reading is easy.  I can be on a beach in glaring sunlight or in a pitch dark room and still read my Oasis just fine.  The size and weight are fine, but if it were slightly larger (a half inch in height and width) I would not complain, and the grip area is great as it can be held with either hand.  I don't write a lot of reviews and when I do, there's usually some negative thing to say, but with the Oasis there really isn't. It's a spendy device, but when I consider the $ per hour I use it, the cost is inconsequential. If I had another laundry mishap with my Oasis, I'd order a brand new one without a seconds hesitation.",11 people found this helpful
Kindle Oasis ‚Äì With 7‚Äù display and page turn buttons,4.0,a definite upgrade for me,"Reviewed in the United States üá∫üá∏ on August 4, 2019",Digital Storage Capacity: 32 GB | Offer Type: Lockscreen Ad-Supported | Color: Graphite | Option: Without Kindle Unlimited,True,"I have been a Kindle Voyage reader for several years now, and though I did try some newer kindle iterations, I ended up returning them simply because the most important aspect of the device, the richness of the e-ink seemed to have been lacking. After the Voyage, all the newer devices including the previous generation Oasis leaned towards a more faded out, greyer looking e-ink (which was partially resolved by allowing for boldness). So, not even the previous Oasis 2 and much less the cover charging Oasis 1 could dislodge me from the Voyage (which I have kept for reasons of portability and practicality with its origami stand up cover).So what convinced me to get this Oasis, if I was already satisfied with the Voyage? Well, nothing really; it just so happened that my birthday coincided with the new Oasis release and my wife ordered it for me, after trading in a kindle keyboard (and I am glad she did). The contrast and richness of the fonts were just as good as the Voyage I kept. Furthermore, the screen was evenly lit even in its highest settings for brightness and amber. So the Oasis 3 surpassed my expectations (although I‚Äôve kept my Voyage as my back up).If I had already been an Oasis user, there would be no way I would have considered upgrading, as the changes from the previous model have been minimal.  As a Voyage user, however, this was a significant upgrade and change in many ways:1. First of all, storage. I have the 32 G model, but even the 8 G would have been quite an upgrade from my 4 G Voyage. Now I can add my annotated editions of literature, audiobooks and illustrated works without any qualm.2. Larger 7‚Äù display: my eyes are not getting any younger, and the ability to have more text on the page does make more of a difference than I thought it would‚Äîalthough it does so by losing the portability factor. The Voyage could slip into my back or front pocket quite easily, but in the end, I do prefer the larger screen. In any case, carrying the ergonomic Oasis still beats lugging an armful of books.3. Waterproof: It is nice to know that this device is waterproof (just in case), and it does add some ease of mind, but I‚Äôll confess I‚Äôve taken the Voyage with me pretty much everywhere in all kinds of weather‚Äîeven to the beach, pools, on cruises, the desert, (you name it) and it is still working pretty much the day I received it. I expect no less from the Oasis, but I won‚Äôt have second thoughts of sitting with it in the tub.4. Audible: I do read and like to be read to, so it is nice to have this option; I do use Audible a lot, and though I prefer the way Audible works in its phone app, it is nice to have all your books, audible or otherwise on one device. However, I do think Amazon has a ways to go towards perfecting the Audible experience on the e-readers.5. Lighting: Voyage lighting was adequate (not perfect), as I found any light setting to be a bit much for these eyes; most of the time I read with lighting pretty much off. The Oasis has solved that by adding the amber warmth, so this was a needed upgrade for me.6. There is also an inverted mode where the background becomes black and the fonts become lit. This actually looks gorgeous when setting the amber to the max.7. The page turn buttons are infinitely more satisfying than the Voyage, although I think the old keyboard had the best buttons on any kindle that I‚Äôve had.8. The screen rotation, while nice for righties vs. lefties, does disappoint a wee bit in that it does not rotate to landscape automatically.9. Battery life: I know there are complaints about battery here, but I suspect his may because the device was loaded up rather quickly and the indexing of the titles does drain the battery. So far have loaded less than a dozen titles and am easing into my Oasis set up, allowing for indexing to be done in little spurts. Of course, I cannot make any definite assessments on the battery until I go through a couple more charging cycles, but it looks to be about two weeks on a single charge with about half hour to an hour reading everyday with airplane mode (which really does prolong battery) unless I need to sync or use the store. Oh, and I set the mid-range 12 for both light settings.Those were the main upgrades for me, but there are few things that I need to get used to:1. The form factor (I‚Äôve been using the Voyage for years, so this will take some time; the Voyage still takes the cake in this aspect).2. I wish Amazon made an origami case for this one; I did use the stand up many times during a lunch break. It‚Äôs really no biggie. I now use an Amazon Basics stand that works even better than the origami to keep the Oasis propped up at multiple angles for my reading pleasure.3. I really do not see the benefit of a graphite versus whatever as this is covered with my waterproof charcoal case; however, I would have loved the front of the Oasis offered in solid white or cream, to mimic the extension of a page but this is easily resolvable with a third party skin.4. Price: Let‚Äôs not cushion this. For this price we should seriously be getting no ads thrown in, and a full charger (not just the cable). I would say that the cloth case should be thrown in as well, but that would be pushing it.Suggestions to kindle software developers (Sorry to throw this into the review, but it worked last time when the developers actually contacted me to let me know that they had taken my suggestions and implemented it in one of the updates, so here it goes again):Can we get the option to have pages (not actual pages but screenshots) remaining when reading in a chapter? I know not everyone cares for these options, but I find the time remaining to always be inaccurate as I vary in reading poetry versus prose on my kindle all the time, so it would be nice to have this option.Also, the ability to scroll would be nice.And while, we‚Äôre at it, why not let us use our own screensavers? From our own books or a selection of literary images.In short, the device really surpassed my expectations, and for something I really wasn‚Äôt planning on getting, this one is definitely a keeper.Still, for Voyage users, I would recommend trading in an older kindle, as the Voyage still has its own little benefits.",50 people found this helpful
Kindle Oasis ‚Äì With 7‚Äù display and page turn buttons,4.0,Great device if you have an older kindle and want to upgrade.,"Reviewed in the United States üá∫üá∏ on December 23, 2020",Digital Storage Capacity: 8 GB | Offer Type: Lockscreen Ad-Supported | Color: Graphite | Option: Without Kindle Unlimited,True,"This is my 2nd kindle and first Oasis the previous kindle I had was the Kindle Paperwhite 2015. I finally decided to bite the bullet and upgrade. To be fair there wasn‚Äôt any reason for this other than I wanted to upgrade. My 2015 Kindle Paperwhite is still functional but wasn‚Äôt syncing properly. I decided that I would upgrade to the Oasis as I honestly didn‚Äôt see much difference with the newer Paperwhite 2019 except the new backlight and flush screen.Ok first things first the Oasis is extremely thin and light. The bevel edge where the battery is located serves its function which allows readers to use it one handed. The back is aluminum versus the basic kindle/Paperwhite which have a rubber finish. The aluminum back can get cold if you prefer to use it without a case like I do. The screen auto rotates which  allow those of us that like to switch to either the left or right hand while sitting or lying down. A 4 stars feature in my opinion. The screen is flush and the ‚Äúpages‚Äù are crisp. You have page turn buttons which I think to be honest are an asset and preferable to the touchscreen as I would accidentally tap through too many pages on the Paperwhite. The page turn buttons come in handy as you can also disable the touchscreen while reading by tapping the dots while in your book on the right side of the screen which will bring up the options screen and disable touchscreen is on there. To enable the touchscreen again you press the power button twice which will bring up the lock screen to access the touchscreen again. The backlight features aren‚Äôt really a necessity for me as I don‚Äôt normally read in the dark but comes in handy when I am not in a well lit room. The kindle oasis is waterproof and you now have the ability to listen to audible books (only audible books) wirelessly via Bluetooth. Personally, for me this is a feature that I don‚Äôt think is necessary as I tend to listen to audiobooks on my audible app or the Libby/overdrive app. Also, you can not listen to both the audible book and read the ebook which I think is ridiculous especially if amazon is advertising this as a premium feature. You should be able to listen and read simultaneously. The worst feature on the Oasis is the battery life. My 2015 Paperwhite‚Äôs battery would last for days/week even when I wasn‚Äôt using it or if I was continuously using it for a minimum of an hour a day. The Oasis battery drains fast I found on a full charge and reading for an hour at a 100 % it easily went down to 70%. I initially had an issue with it not charging to 100% but after factory resetting it I found the solution was that I wasn‚Äôt using the micro usb charging cable that came with it. I was using the old one from the Paperwhite as they seemed similar but after using the correct charging cable the Oasis was charging to 100%. So anyone having issues with it not charging to 100% make sure it is being charged with the cable it came with!The fix for extending the battery life is keeping the device on airplane mode, lowering your light settings. Now it drains less as I am at 73% after a week of usage after changing those settings. However, I believe a device as expensive as this should have an excellent battery without having to tweak and alter the very settings they claim make this a premium device the backlights. I believe if the battery life last longer and was durable like the Paperwhite this would be without a doubt their best device yet.Some suggestions for new users to maximize your device‚Äôs potential:If you have Amazon Prime then you have access to a slew of ebooks through Prime Reading included for free (You could also sign up for kindle unlimited but you would have to pay the subscription).Get a library card. You can now download the overdrive or Libby app (or both) on your phone  and now you have instant access to library books sent straight to your device.Sign up for amazon deals of the day under account settings to get free or discounted ebook suggestions daily so you don‚Äôt ever have to buy full price books.Look out for Great on Kindle books as these ebooks gives you credits towards you next ebook purchase albeit you will more likely than not have to purchase the ebook at full price but you can often get upwards to $5.00 in ebook credits toward others.You have a week to return a ebook (a feature I did not know of until recently).Lastly, buy the kindle with special features and save yourself an extra $20. The ads are not annoying like some claim. In fact the only time you see ads is on the lock screen and on the home page at the bottom and they are usually ads of ebooks on sale (most times tailored to your reading preference) so this is a benefit to the reader. And if the ads end up annoying you then you can always hide them under the settings option on your device or you can contact Amazon later and pay $20 to have them removed.Also, get the 8 GB version unless your planning on storing audible books (which take up A LOT of space) and ebooks than the 8 GB is sufficient and will save you money.In the end would I recommend this device? Absolutely, especially if you already have a older kindle, a basic kindle or a newer Paperwhite and wish for an upgrade. However, if this is your first ever kindle I would recommend the Kindle Paperwhite which is the perfect medium between all three devices. It has the backlight feature, smaller in size, and cheaper in price. In the end these devices really are for reading.My opinion either way is these devices last a really long time so after a year or two they pay for themselves.  If you have an older model and its still functional and want to save money then keep it until a better upgraded version comes out in a few years.",20 people found this helpful
Kindle Oasis ‚Äì With 7‚Äù display and page turn buttons,4.0,THIS OASIS CRITIC HAS TO ADMIT: NEW LIGHT IS A TOTAL GAME CHANGER!,"Reviewed in the United States üá∫üá∏ on July 29, 2019",Digital Storage Capacity: 8 GB | Offer Type: Lockscreen Ad-Supported | Color: Graphite | Option: Without Kindle Unlimited,True,"I wrote a lengthy critical review of the 2017 Oasis, which was the first Kindle that I‚Äôve ever returned out of every top model. I mainly criticized the cold and slippery aluminum shell for intruding on, rather than disappearing from, the reading experience. But along with those criticisms, I praised its bigger 7‚Äù screen as the one aspect that I would miss. And now, with the upgrade of that screen to one with adjustable color temperature, I decided to give the 2019 Oasis a try, even though its design was unchanged from 2017.Cutting right to the chase: the adjustable color temperature screen is the greatest advance in Kindles since self-illuminating screens were introduced on the first Paperwhite‚Ä¶ period, full-stop. And, at least for this reader, there‚Äôs no going back after trying it out. It‚Äôs that good, and that much of a game changer.With both warmth and brightness (they have separate controls) turned up to about the midway point, reading on a Kindle transitioned for the first time from merely reading words, to the experience of reading words on a paper page in a book. This might sound like ‚ÄúWho cares?‚Äù nonsense to most people, but if you‚Äôre in that small minority of the public buying a high-end Kindle, you understand what I mean, and it‚Äôs that kind of difference that you‚Äôre paying for.The new lighting also transforms the experience of reading in a completely dark room. On existing Kindles, I could never find quite the right light level. If it was as bright as I wanted it to be, that felt too harsh on my eyes. But bringing brightness down to a level that felt comfortable seemed too dim. Now, by simply increasing the lighting warmth on the new Oasis, you can have brighter light with no harshness in a dark room, making reading much easier on the eyes.Finally, I‚Äôm happy to say that Amazon seems to have (finally!) nailed the quality control issues that have plagued new Kindle lighting systems in the past: No splotches. No dark spots. No shadows. No weird color casts. Just smooth, even, beautiful lighting across the screen.So, is this the perfect Kindle for me? No. The perfect Kindle would be this new 7‚Äù screen in a Voyager form factor. The ergonomics of the Oasis are still not great for me, although my satisfaction with the new screen appears to make the annoyances matter less. The 2019 Oasis is not only a keeper for me, but I‚Äôm actually trading in both my Voyager and original Oasis.Thanks for taking the time to read my review and I hope you find it helpful in making a buying decision. Time permitting, I do try to answer any questions posted in the comments section.","4,032 people found this helpful"
Kindle Oasis ‚Äì With 7‚Äù display and page turn buttons,3.0,Good reading experience but overpriced and underperforms,"Reviewed in the United States üá∫üá∏ on April 9, 2021",Digital Storage Capacity: 8 GB | Offer Type: Lockscreen Ad-Supported | Color: Graphite | Option: Without Kindle Unlimited,True,"Kindle Oasis ReviewSummary: I‚Äôm stunned at the number of 5-star reviews here. For me, the Oasis is overpriced and underperforms.  What I would expect of the top-end Kindle is performance akin to the ios Kindle app.  It does not come close, and the Oasis is not noticeably faster than any of the other Kindles.  A Kindle doesn‚Äôt need an M1 chip to significantly speed up its performance.  If Apple is able to emulate the paper reading tech on a Kindle I‚Äôll never buy another Kindle.# My ReviewI've owned the Oases 10th generation now for several months and I use it almost every day and I'd like to share my observations especially since some of the reviews that helped me make up my mind were misleading.I'm a top-of-the-line guy generally speaking. I often buy my electronics fully specced out, and that was one reason I went for the Oasis.  I wanted to believe all of the marketing hype about it but not all of it translates to a great user experience.## battery lifeI‚Äôm neutral on battery life. I don't seem to have the weeks of battery life I had on my previous Kindles.  I get about two weeks before I see signs of needing to charge, and I don‚Äôt think my reading habits changed from when I used my old Voyager Kindle, and that did seem to last forever before I needed to plug it in.My Oasis seems to need a plug-in every 2 - 3 weeks.  Maybe because I most often use it in night mode with the screen black and the letters in white.  Perhaps this draws more energy from the battery.  I don't know. But this Oasis does not seem to last as long as my earlier Kindle models.## SpeedGigantic negative on speed. One reviewer said the Oasis is lightning fast.  It definitely is not.Page forwards and backs are adequate, but most other actions take a full second at best, and some close to two seconds. I have the sense of having to wait for the Kindle to react, as I did with all of my earlier Kindles.I find this performance disappointing in a top-end model. This is shameful given what chip speeds are today, and it's clear that Amazon has underspecified all of its Kindle readers to keep their margins high.What I would have expected from the oasis is speed similar to the Kindle app on iOS or Android.  A Kindle doesn‚Äôt need an expensive M1 chip to significantly speed up its performance.  If Apple is able to emulate the paper reading tech on a Kindle I‚Äôll never buy another Kindle.Bottom line here is: whatever reason you buy the Oasis over another Kindle, do not buy it because you think it will have a snappier response than the other Kindles.  Perhaps if you have them side by side you will notice a difference, but when using my Oasis I would expect to be impressed and I'm not.## designThis is a plus.  I did not expect to like the lop-sided design but after using it I do.  It's easier to hold in the hand, and I really like the way the text auto-rotates on flipping the entire Oasis when I move it from one hand to the next.  You would do that by the way, so that whichever hand you're holding the unit in is always holding the thickest part of the device.One word of advice on getting a case for this puppy is don't get one.  Get a sleeve for it instead.  The biggest advantage of the Oasis over the other versions is this quirky design.  It's much nicer and easier to hold in your hand naked (the Kindle, not you), and a case just nullifies the Oasis design and makes it heavier.  The only disadvantage is losing the auto-on/off from using a case that allows that, but in practice turning the unit off and on by hitting the button on the top is no inconvenience.## buggy page turnsThe biggest issue I've had with my Oasis is that the page turns are buggy.  I do like how the buttons can be configured so that you can use the lower button to go forward and the top one to go back, but what happens with my unit is that I would hit page forward and the pages sometimes go forward one page, and then 2 or 3 more all based on my pressing page forward once.  This happens once every ten times or so, just enough to annoy me, but not enough for me to get the unit replaced.  Replacing would not be easy as I'm located outside of the USA, and I would have to pay the shipping costs.## Reading experienceBig positive on the reading experience.  The reason for being of any Kindle reader is the paper reading emulation, and this is great on the Oasis.  I do like the night mode and use it a lot as I do most of my reading before I go to sleep.  I've no opinion on the adjustable warm light as I've never noticed it.  When I read in daylight I can easily adjust it manually and I don't know if any automatic adjustment is happening or if it's really in my eyes' best interest.What I miss and expected by this generation is the ability to flip through pages going forward or back, the way you can in a book.  The tech to do this was available years ago and it's disappointing to not yet have this even in the top-end KindleNote on audible books on Kindle: I do not use my Kindle for audible books. I get why the option is available, but I listen to audible with my iPhone when I'm on the go and will never use my kindle over my iPhone to listen to an audible book.  As such, I don't appreciate my library being cluttered with my audible books and I haven't found how to filter them out.Overall, the Oasis is majorly overpriced given the experience of it.  Its design is surprisingly useful and that together with autorotate and the wider screen is worth a premium but Amazon has taken advantage of us in the pricing of this unit.  I would suggest the Paperwhite or at least wait for the price to drop at one of Amazon's promotions before you buy it.  Better yet, get a low-cost Kindle and download the iOS app on your iPad.  The user experience on an iPad is fantastic.  If only it could emulate paper.",20 people found this helpful
Kindle Oasis ‚Äì With 7‚Äù display and page turn buttons,5.0,A life changer for me...,"Reviewed in the United States üá∫üá∏ on March 4, 2020",Digital Storage Capacity: 8 GB | Offer Type: Lockscreen Ad-Supported | Color: Graphite | Option: Without Kindle Unlimited,True,"It is difficult to write a review as positive as I would like this one to be and not seem to be a shill.  But here goes.....This device is my first e-reader, and it has actually changed the way I live--literally (and figuratively, too, I guess).  Succinctly, I have now canceled cable TV and rediscovered the pleasure of reading books again and, in the process, regained a healthier day/night sleep cycle.  As an aside, I also no longer feel the need to joke I‚Äôm cultivating functional illiteracy.I used to be an inveterate reader of books, but that changed over the years for a multitude of reasons:  technical studies that meant slow reading; hours in front of a computer monitor for work, tiring the eyes; naturally declining vision no longer correctable simultaneously for all distances with contact lenses; a deep aversion to glasses riding on my ears, etc.  Then came retirement and the discovery of streaming TV that led more than once to asking myself, ""When did it become light again?""Streaming TV, however, did lead me to the Kindle Oasis‚ÄîI got hooked on a book-based TV series that piqued my desire to go further in depth and read the books, and in preparation for a long trip, I bought the first book of the series.  At over 600 pages long and in a standard size print, it was just unwieldy for long periods of holding it for reading.  That led me to consider a Kindle, but I knew I wanted one I could also be read in bright sunlight.  This one was what I chose.  Within a week, I had bought, downloaded, and read several of the books (each 500-700 pages).  The TV remained off the whole week, and I re-established a healthier pattern of turning in when I was tired.  (I can still ""watch"" TV through half-lidded eyes, but I cannot continue reading that way.)  Two weeks after getting my Kindle, I canceled cable TV.  I still have streaming, but it‚Äôs no longer as compelling.  As pricy as this Kindle is, it will still save me money with the reduction in cable fees within 4 months (and that includes the prices of the purchased books).Surprisingly, my Kindle Oasis has led me to discoveries about myself and poor reading habits that I‚Äôm now remedying - pleasurably.  For example, I often used to come upon an unknown word and divine a meaning (probably imprecise) from the context or just skipped it altogether as being non-essential to the story.  I just get too caught up in the book to interrupt the flow and reach for a reference.  Now, however, I call up references on the fly without even putting the Kindle down.  Words whose meaning I previously would have glossed over take on new significance (definition, etymology, usage, related terms and subject matter).  I gain an greater appreciation for the author's word choice and learn a lot in the process.  This really is a fundamentally more enriching and rewarding way to read.Physically, the device (being so small) had the potential to be awkward to hold for extended periods, but the asymmetric form-factor actually makes it easier whether one is right- or left-handed.  With a cover attached it feels much like a comfortably sized paperback book.  I opted for the premium leather cover (separate review, but it's worth every single penny and possibly some), and it makes the Kindle even more comfortable in the hand.  The Oasis fits in my jacket pocket, immediately ready anywhere I am.  This experience with its small size even drove my decision about the size of tablet computer I would choose to replace my aging one (I chose the mini sized one and not the full-sized one after trying both).The lighting is so uniform, it was difficult to believe the text was not back illuminated, but I did a little research and found (NYT article with diagrams and pictures) that it is, indeed, front illuminated with LED's around the border shining into a horizontal film (i.e., light-guide) ‚Äúfloating‚Äù above the page that ""conducts"" the light horizontally parallel to the reading surface and then down onto the page in an amazingly uniform distribution of illumination.  And one can ""tune"" the color of the light towards warmer tones (i.e., towards the red end of the spectrum) that are easier for the eye to recover from in a dark environment--the reason visual astronomers have red-filtered lights to view star charts in the dark).  It even looks like reading a beloved old book.Charging is quick and simple but not entirely without a little awkwardness. .  I was a little disappointed to see a micro-USB slot for charging.  My aversion is based on the fact that it can be a little difficult for me to line up the plug with the charging slot even in full light. The Kindle Oasis maintains a charge for a long period, but I do try to remind myself to put it back into Airplane mode after pursuing a reference just because.  I do wish there were a timer that would revert the Kindle back to Airplane mode after some period of non-use as a power saving mechanism.All told, I‚Äôm glad this thing did not exist when I was a kid.  The flashlight-under-the-covers-book-reading-trick got me into trouble enough with my parents, but this would have made me a chronic offender and them apoplectic.I love gadgets.  I have a lot.  This is unquestionably my favorite.",9 people found this helpful
Kindle Oasis ‚Äì With 7‚Äù display and page turn buttons,1.0,Absolutely the Worst Kindle ever,"Reviewed in the United States üá∫üá∏ on July 11, 2022",Digital Storage Capacity: 32 GB | Offer Type: Lockscreen Ad-Supported | Color: Graphite | Option: Without Kindle Unlimited,True,"I have 17 Kindle devices, beginning with Gen One. I have used them since the first year. My favorite ones are the Keyboards, but I have most of the others, as well.  I thought the Fire was the the worst until the Oasis supplanted it.  (I am NOT a novice Kindle user.)Amazon finally decided to stop supporting the Kindle Store on the Keyboards. Though I can buy books on my PC, and then download them to any device, I really prefer to buy using the Store on my actual reader. Consequently, I made the decision to buy another new Kindle.  The Oasis sounded great.Big mistake. I finally got it, and have spent two days trying to get it to work. I still believe that it probably will, someday, do the things Amazon promised it would, but I have had no success yet.The first day I spent trying to access the User‚Äôs Manual, simply to understand how the Collections function works. Failed. I next spent most of today searching for forums online which might explain it all.  None of the instructions I found anywhere, whether from Amazon, or from private sources, worked.The menu functions are garbage. They are confusing and have no intuitive logic whatsoever. After two days I am still trying to fathom how I can simply SEE my list of collections. I can‚Äôt find them in the menus. The one time I found ‚ÄúCollections‚Äù listed somewhere or other, in a list on one of the many mini-menus, seemingly randomly, it was grayed out and could not be accessed.I finally found the way to show the Collections on the Home Screen, instead of being hidden in one of the many menus or sub-menus or sub-sub-menus. But, only a couple show up. And, there was no logic, at all, to the ones that did appear. AND, oddly enough, those had a few books in them. They shouldn‚Äôt have had any.The way it works on ALL of the other Kindles is that the entire list of Collection folders transfers from device to device. The folders are empty until you manually enter the books you want into them. Each Kindle contains different books in each collection, because I have different books on each device.(In an effort to get around this problem, I tried to create new collections on this new device, but was informed that I could not, because the collections already existed, ‚Äúin the cloud‚Äù. But, I can‚Äôt find them.)For this new device, I chose to only download the unread books, rather than my entire library, (of over 3700), thinking that I would have a sleek, clean new reader. They are all contained in my ‚ÄúNew‚Äù Collection, on the Kindle I have been using lately, so it was easy for me to choose them to download.  On the Oasis, this Collection appeared with three books in it, (???), but only 47 of the 196 others downloaded seem to have made it.  It is anyone‚Äôs guess where the rest disappeared to. I will have to compare both lists of books, from the old and new Kindles, side by side, to ID the missing ones. Another couple of hours of wasted time. And, then what? Try it all again? More wasted time.I will likely have to wipe the new Kindle, and try to download the books again from the PC. It doesn‚Äôt work properly from the device, itself.So, after two days, I‚Äôll have to flush it all and start over.  Additionally, the downloads suck out the battery quickly, so it is even slower. This may take another three days. IT‚ÄôS ONLY 196 BOOKS!  Amazon‚Äôs advertising is bogus.Also, paging through the book cover pages is ridiculous. I love the way they are listed as text in older versions. You can still, with the Oasis, put them in Author order, or Title, or by Recently Received. But, the book covers are small, and really dark on the screen, and the writing is nearly unreadable. I like nice clean text. But, although I managed, with the help of a forum, to change to ‚ÄúList‚Äù order from ‚Äúbook cover‚Äù, at some point, the Kindle arbitrarily reverted back to its default. So, I am still stuck with unreadable names and titles. I have no idea at all why the Kindle voided my choice.Using the Kindle app on the iPad works fine. The images are crisp, bright and readable. But, still, though the reading experience on the Pad is spectacular, the organization is a mess. Even worse than Kindle.(I had hoped that Amazon would have designed, by now, an e-reader experience which compared favorably to the Apple iPad, but it isn‚Äôt even close. But, I digress.)Let‚Äôs see, what else? The back-lit screen, on this new Oasis, which was actually a major selling point for me, wavers back and forth from light to darker, without my instruction. At times it goes out entirely. Totally distracting.The Oasis also freezes frequently.In its favor, it is small, and light, and is easy to carry around wherever you go. (But, then, so is a notepad.)Another big selling point was that it is ‚Äúwaterproof‚Äù. Amazon promises that you will be able to read at the beach, or in the pool,  or in the bath. BIG selling point. BIG!  But, the fine print, when you get your Kindle, advises you that it is only waterproof against an accidental dunking, after which you must rush to clean it up.  Amazon also refuses to take responsibility unless you buy an extended warranty. Not waterproof! False advertising.This device is a baby step up from the Fire, which will not make any Collections, at all.  (The reason I tossed it in a drawer, and never used it.)It DOES have page turn buttons. The Paperwhite does not, and is the reason THAT Kindle now lives in the same drawer as the Fire.$480 when all is said and done. Most expensive Kindle I have bought, yet. (The Gen One was $350, but it was the first.)Tonight I am reading on the Keyboard. Best Kindle ever made. The Oasis, if I don‚Äôt just decide to return it, will probably end up in the same drawer with the Fire and the Paperwhite.Piece of ****.Three months later:  still the worst piece of garbage I have bought. Still cannot figure out how to use it. The manuals I have HAD TO PAY FOR do not seem to be correct for this device. It is only by accident that I can get into my library, or the store. Once, when I managed to find the store, I chose the book I wanted, which was correctly identified on my screen, but Amazon delivered a book by the same name, different author, instead. Once I got into a book, but could not get out of it without shutting down the device and rebooting it. (I am sure there is a way, but nothing I have found out, or tried, has worked.)How can they sell products like this? How can they then charge you $2.99 to buy a manual written by an outside source, which does not correspond, in any way, to the device they sold me?I am disgusted with Amazon. I have wasted a lot of money on this crap, and still can‚Äôt use it.And, again, lest you think I am a novice, I have 17 other Kindles, most of which I like. (Except the Fire or the Paper White.). Why does Amazon dump its support for earlier, well made models, in favor of newer ones which are too much trouble to ever use?I will never buy another Kindle, and will probably just read the books I have left in my library, and then buy another device on a new platform.",104 people found this helpful
Kindle Oasis ‚Äì With 7‚Äù display and page turn buttons,5.0,Retina friendly if you have bad eyes-Your search is over!,"Reviewed in the United States üá∫üá∏ on June 24, 2022",Digital Storage Capacity: 32 GB | Offer Type: Lockscreen Ad-Supported | Color: Champagne Gold | Option: Without Kindle Unlimited,True,"My biggest concern is due to medical issues. I have detached retinas in both eyes due to slamming my head against the headrest in a car accident when someone hit me from behind. I did have surgery to reattach them, and my vision has never been the same. I can't stay on my phone, be in the sun, or be on the computer for long without my eyes hurting or seeing lots of floaters. They're super-sensitive, but I love to read. I don't like paper books because not only do you have to lug them everywhere, but the print is small, which again gives me a headache because it adds strain on the eyes. So I poured over the reviews, articles, and YouTube videos on whether I wanted the Paperwhite or the new Oasis that just came out (I've had this for over a year now). It was hard because it was the latest model and had few reviews.I noticed several things people were complaining about were the battery life; it did not come with a plug (it comes with a cord, though), the price, the button position, and the size. Let me break it down:Pros:*Battery life: I didn't see an issue with battery life, and I usually read a new book every two days, which means I charge it roughly around the 3rd day. I don't know what everyone's settings are, though, because I keep mine dim due to eye sensitivity. It charges super fast, just as fast as my phone. I was at 9%, put it on the charger, made some scrambled eggs, and by the time I returned, it was already at 54%. So to me, it wasn't an issue, and it's no more bothersome than a phone.*Wall plug: Once again, it didn't bother me. With all the electronics in my house, including the computers and phones, I have them up the whazoo.*Button position: All you need to do is adjust the settings to reverse it or use the touch screen to turn pages. My touchscreen is sensitive even when dirty, and no, there's no time lag. Luckily, the button settings were good for me. I didn't have to change anything, and I'm picky. The only thing I mess around with is the font size and adjusting the lights.*Size: That was a big positive for me. It's easier to hold onto. I can adjust the font as big as I want (like child size), there's more of a screen footprint to do so, and it's waterproof. Because my vision is limited, I'm clumsy and often drop things. I've dropped this thing numerous times on the pavement from a lifted Jeep: no scratches or cracks. Also, I like the added security that if I drop it in water that it'll be fine.***MOST IMPORTANT** The light settings. Many years ago, LG came out with a tablet that had a background with yellow light settings. I noticed that no matter how long I was on it that my eyes didn't hurt. No blue light eye strain or having to buy special glasses for it. That was the deciding factor for me. My husband bought me the paperwhite, which was too bright and small for me, so I returned it. My physical therapist said he went through two paperwhites and had to get insurance because they crack easily. That's his experience, though. I have no clue about that; back to the Oasis. I can adjust the light settings to read in the dark or in the sun. That's amazing to me, making it worth every penny I spent. In the long run, your eyes will thank you. As we get older, the gel in the eyes pulls away, which is why our vision gets worse, and this is why I can't recommend Oasis enough. If you like paperback books, maybe you could adjust the lighting to mimic the pages? It's just a thought. I did purchase it during Prime Days and was able to get it for almost 100 dollars off. So if it's out of your price range, check on it during Prime days, Amazon electronics deals, and holidays.Cons: I can't think of one. It would be nice to have extra storage, though. I'm not really into gadgets, so maybe that's why it doesn't bother me. It's just simple to use for me.Specs:Champagne gold32GBI have Kindle Unlimited with Ads.*I did purchase the no-ad option, but somehow, there was a mix-up, and being that it would take me six months to get it without ads (ludicrous), I just stuck with the ads. I kind of like it, though. It already knows what my preferences are, so I like the suggestions.I hope this helps someone, and please hit the like button if it did help. This was a long review, and I wasn't sure if I should do it. Good luck!",139 people found this helpful
Kindle Oasis ‚Äì With 7‚Äù display and page turn buttons,5.0,From a bookworm perspective,"Reviewed in the United States üá∫üá∏ on September 29, 2020",Digital Storage Capacity: 8 GB | Offer Type: Lockscreen Ad-Supported | Color: Graphite | Option: Without Kindle Unlimited,True,"I bought my very first Kindle in 2008. It was called The Amazon Kindle at that time. It took me almost a year from when it was released to actually buy one. I loved books and I was scared it wouldn't be the same, that it would diminish my love for reading, for holding a book in my hand, and turning the pages. I was totally wrong lol I freaking loved the kindle, as soon as I had it in hand I was a goner. Having my whole library in the palm of my hand was mind blowing. I had that kindle for 5 loving years, until one day at Best Buy I noticed the the Fire HDX 3rd generation. It captivated me with all it's lovely colors, it was beautiful, so my husband bought it for me for Christmas lol... guess I couldn't hide how enamored I was with it. My other kindle found a good home with my sister lol. I could finally read in the dark with the fire, and I spent hours and hours just looking at book covers because they were beautiful. I had that Kindle for 7 wonderful years, until one sad day my apps, including my Amazon store app wouldn't open üò¢ my software was too old. My husband and my oldest son took me to dinner for my Birthday on September 22nd, and afterward we ended up at Best Buy in the Kindle section. When I noticed the Oasis it was like time stood still, when I picked her up I knew she would be mine. Sure it's not flashy like the Fire, but I'm no spring chicken. The ink like words on book like paper with a muted not so bright back light eased my tired eyes. She's so slim, and small, she fit perfectly in my small hands. A smile broke out on my face and my huband said ok let's get it. I left Best Buy with my order in hand to be delivered by Friday the 25th. Best Buy didn't have the 32g in rose gold, and there was no way I was getting the 8, I have way too many books to be messing with the itty-bitty 8g. So here we are, my Kindle Oasis 10th gen, and me 5 days later; How's it going? Glad you asked, cuz she's my best friend, we knew it as soon as I opened the package on Thursday, put my new protective case on her, plugged her in, and powered her up. We played for a few minutes learning each other and just clicked when she opened my first book for me. It's uncanny how much her pages look like book pages. I love how she lights up for me in the dark, but doesn't blind me. Tbh I'm still learning her warmth, but what's a little mystery between friends. During the day I turn off the backlight and turn on airplane mode, and at night I of course turn the backlight on. The only time I turn my airplane mode off is when I'm looking through the store or downloading from my cloud. I unselfishly decided not to crowd her with my very big library.. but wow she downloads fast. I read all day on Friday and after I was done I had no headache... no headache or strained eyes! I had to take breaks from my fire 1) she strained my eyes and I would get a small throb behind my eyes... 2) her battery drained super quickly.. even with power saving tricks... 3) sometimes her downloads would not quite be fast enough and I'd have to try later.  I. Am. Amazed. The oasis is super quick turning the pages and she gives you 3.. I said 3 different ways to do that, press the button, tap the left or right side of the screen, or swipe left or right. Her battery life far exceeds my older kindle. My Fire had to be charged daily. The Oasis I plugged in Thursday to charge her up and just now plugged her in (Tuesday) 5 days later and she was at 42%. She even has different profiles you can store and name. I think of it as reading your way, from different text style, to size of text, and different margins. You make her yours. Tbh I do miss the colors though, I'm an artist and the loss of colors will take time to get over. I don't know everything about my new friend the Oasis, but we have time and I look forward to learning more about her. I don't do audio books but I might try it once with her to see how it sounds.. I love how there is no headphone jack, it's done though blue tooth. I know she comes with a hefty price tag.. she cost us around $400 after tax and extra 2 year warranty. For me though it's worth it cuz I'll have her with me everyday and everywhere I go for years and years to come. She will be my constant.. she will be my bridge to other worlds and for me that's priceless üíï",13 people found this helpful
Kindle Oasis ‚Äì With 7‚Äù display and page turn buttons,3.0,"Still miffed about needing Bluetooth for headphones, and now a $20 fee to dispense with ads!?  Geez!","Reviewed in the United States üá∫üá∏ on December 11, 2022",Digital Storage Capacity: 32 GB | Offer Type: Lockscreen Ad-Supported | Color: Champagne Gold | Option: Without Kindle Unlimited,True,"I dropped my rating from 5 to 3 stars, not because, as the ""headline"" suggests - the absence of a headphone jack, BUT because I had to pay an additional $20 to stop the annoying adds I was getting with this Oasis.I have an awesome pair of Bose noise cancelling headphones (non-Bluetooth) that I had to purchase a Bluetooth receiver to make use of.  This works fine but was a $70 outlay I should not have had to make.I have used the Bluetooth feature of the Oasis but found the audio dropping in and out intermittently when the speaker in question was a Sonos Move.  Maybe a problem with the Sonos Bluetooth implementation?As far as the Oasis as a Kindle reader is concerned, it is decidedly better than my old original Kindle.  The screen is brighter, I can read at night without having to bug my wife by keeping a light on.  That the Oasis handles both Kindle and Audible books is very cool.  I usually buy both versions of a book and love that if I'm in the car listening to an audiobook, when I get home and switch to reading mode, the Oasis remembers where I left of in the audiobook - and vice versa.I just replaced my last Oasis, which went missing.  I am disgusted to now see ads on the Oasis as soon as I open the cover.  For nearly $300, I would expect an unadulterated reading experience.  I hate all this commercialization.  I did a little digging online and saw that I could turn this off, by PAYING A $20 fee.Evidently, I missed this detail at time of purchase.  CAVEAT EMPTOR!One thing I would really like for Amazon to address is figuring out how to do both at the same time - read and listen.  To do so now requires me to fire up a second Kindle (I still have the original.) or a Kindle app on another device.  Why read and listen?  How about when you're reading a foreign language book and wish to learn how to pronounce or spell a word you're not familiar with?  I find this useful even in English language books.Battery life, especially in Airplane mode is pretty good.  Not quite as good as it used to be on the original Kindle, but you can go days without having to recharge - if you're reading.  Audiobooks take more juice, and 6 to 7 hours is about as far as you'll get.Using the Oasis in the car is not as easy as it should be.  The Audible app on my phone does a better job of resuming after a gas stop - or other interruption.The oasis IS expensive compared to a kindle and a free Audible app on another device (plan B).One thing I do like about the Oasis and the likewise expensive optional leather cover is that the Oasis comes close to feeling like you have an actual book in your hands.  I still prefer to read hard cover books, but these are becoming prohibitively expensive as well, and once you're done with them, you pretty much are stuck with a white elephant.  Libraries don't want them, and it'll cost you to sell them at an auction site.  My hardcover library is growing to the point where I have to recycle books just to make room for new ones.  I'm transitioning to a digital library (kicking and screaming, but moving in that direction), so the Oasis helps ease the way.If you're an avid reader, like to also listen to audiobooks, and can afford the downstroke AND fee to suspend ads, the Oasis may be the ticket for you.",9 people found this helpful
Kindle Oasis ‚Äì With 7‚Äù display and page turn buttons,4.0,Almost Perfect,"Reviewed in the United States üá∫üá∏ on October 26, 2020",Digital Storage Capacity: 8 GB | Offer Type: Lockscreen Ad-Supported | Color: Graphite | Option: Without Kindle Unlimited,True,"I've always like the Kindle E-Readers. I previously owned a Paperwhite and love how much easier on my eyes the screen is vs using my tablets, computers, or phone screens. Recently I decided to upgrade to a newer model to add the water resistance and warmer color backlighting. Additionally I like the way the current models support audiobooks. So I decided to order a Kindle Oasis. This E-Reader is very nice I especially like the bigger screen, and although only by an inch, it is noticeably better when reading. The Oasis also is very snappy the page turns are very quick sometimes so fast I sometimes think it didn't turn at all. My slightly older paperwhite refreshes at a rate that was very noticeable, sometimes a full second or two can pass before I can continue reading the next page. Now while this is not a big issue, the Oasis just makes reading that much smoother. I also like the physical buttons, this reduces my need to touch the display potentially transferring oils onto the display which I'm trying to read. It used to be difficult to eat breakfast while eating, for example touching buttered toast and then needing to turn the page. While I still wipe my hands before hitting the physical buttons of the Oasis, its better than leaving butter finger marks on the display.There are of course a few things that I don't totally like about the Oasis and these might just be my personal preferences and possibly issues with my unit I'm not sure. The battery seems to drain a lot faster than my Paperwhite which is a few years older. I try to disable Bluetooth and Wifi etc when I'm not using those or need to make it last longer if I'm traveling, but then the Whisper sync doesn't work and if I open my books on other devices, the pages I'm on are not sync'd. I had thought that with the baby-bump on the back of it, it would be a place to house a bigger battery but at least in my comparison testing it seems to drain faster than an older Paperwhite. I will state though that it still does have great battery life, just that I personally noticed a difference. This is not a deal breaker, just making my own observation.The next thing that I noticed is that even when I completely turn down the Warmth setting, the screen appears a slight pinkish color, also very noticeable next to the Paperwhite. Again, I'm not sure if that's just normal or just my unit. It is nothing to worry about, I just found it interesting.I did have issues with setting it up when I first received it and I almost returned it. My issue was that when I got done with all the steps and it was on the final step to register to my account, it just went to a blank screen only showing the top bar (WiFi, Battery, Clock). It showed nothing down below, just a blank area where my library should be displayed like on my other E-Readers. The screen was also not responding nor buttons to any action I took. I had to hard reboot and then it claimed it needed to update. I thought maybe that was going to fix it but it didn't. I literally had to hard reboot it like 3-4 times, and then finally it booted to my library and has booted that way ever since. I'm not sure why that happened, I've set kindles up for myself and family and this was the first time that happened. I called Amazon and they also said that was strange behavior and other than offering to exchange it, they couldn't explain what that was.I was also puzzled as to why I had requested it be setup for my account in advanced when I purchased it, but then had to do a bunch of setup anyways. I'm not exactly sure what telling them you want it setup in advance even does. I had expected it to just come out of the box and be functional, I could be wrong, that's just what I had assumed.The last thing I'm still getting used to is the weird shape, what I call the Baby-Bump on the back. Its just strange to hold especially with the case front flipped back. Its hard to explain unless you've held one, but with the front flipped back you cant grip the device using the baby-bump edge as a fingertip grip place. The front folded back makes the whole thing smooth across the back, and for at least me it just takes a little getting used to. When I take it out of the case, it feels more well balanced, and I have a more confident grip with my fingers holding the baby-bump.All-in-All I would recommend this to any serious reader. This is device is a little pricey so if you're just a casual reader, you may want to go with the cheaper Paperwhite model. The Paperwhite served me very well for years and I have family members who are more than happy with the 6"" display of the Paperwhite.",3 people found this helpful
Kindle Oasis ‚Äì With 7‚Äù display and page turn buttons,4.0,"Best Reading Experience Available, With Some Room for Improvement","Reviewed in the United States üá∫üá∏ on October 29, 2020",Digital Storage Capacity: 32 GB | Offer Type: Lockscreen Ad-Supported | Color: Graphite | Option: Without Kindle Unlimited,True,"I've owned a half a dozen or so e-readers since they've come out. For sake of focus I'll assert as a given that, for a device specifically for reading, eInk displays are infinitely better than tablets like the Fire or iPad.This (generation 10) Oasis is hands-down the best eInk reader I've seen. The display is fantastic, but honestly the display quality alone is not better-enough that I would've dropped the rather large amount of money to upgrade from my previous Voyage. Since I do most of my reading during lunch breaks, I wanted water resistance in case I got caught out in the rain. With what we've learned about blue light affecting sleep (and bedtime being my other main reading time), the combination of water resistance and warm lighting was enough for me to invest in the upgrade.The lighting on this is fantastic--the additional LEDs really make it a smooth lighting experience from edge to edge and I never catch myself noticing unevenness in the lighting anymore, which has been a problem with other ereaders including previous Kindles. There are a couple criticisms I have here though. Firstly, the auto-adjustment is not particularly great. Sometimes it's adjusting when it shouldn't be or not adjusting when it should (which I think might not be a solvable problem since it's something that moves around in your hands a lot), but also it doesn't feel like it does a great job of gauging how intense the lighting *should* be. This was true for the Voyage as well, but I feel like it's a little worse in the Oasis. Secondly while I LOVE the warm lighting, it doesn't seem to remember how warm I like it when it goes into evening mode nor when it auto-adjusts. I have to re-set it every night, which isn't a hassle, but it's room for improvement.I was worried I wouldn't like the physical page turn buttons but it turns out I like them even better than the ones on my Voyage. I hate using the touch screen to turn pages, even though I feel like the touch screen on my Oasis has been great on sensitivity and responsiveness.The battery life on the Oasis is far worse than my previous Kindles. I mean, as an eInk display it still can go easily a week on one charge and probably even two weeks (I haven't tried to run it out yet), but my Voyage I could easily go a month between charging. I'm not sure if it's the additional lights, the additional processing power, the bluetooth radio, or likely a combination of all these things. I should be clear here that honestly the reduced battery life has not been a problem for me in the slightest--I just charge it once a week and I'm good. I point it out because if you're coming from an earlier Paperwhite or Voyage this is a noticeable difference, and if I were for example leaving it in my car every day for when I go to lunch I would have to remember to bring it in to charge on the weekends rather than waiting a month.My only other criticisms are the ongoing and standard criticisms of Amazon's Kindle ecosystem in general.1. There's inadequate support for PDF and ePub files. Converters like Calibre exist, but there's often annoying little errors. Not even all books purchased through Amazon offer .a3w/.mobi versions.2. It's more difficult than it should be to add and manage books that weren't purchased through Amazon. I get that they're likely not doing anything to hamper it so much as not doing anything to help it, but for a $250 device I find myself having a lot less patience for that. Even in the ""worst-case"" scenario most of my books would still wind up being purchased through Amazon. Open up already.3. Amazon's UIs. I think there's a lot of things that the Kindle device UIs get right. They really do make the reading ""experience"" the front-and-center feature and it's why I prefer the Kindles to everything else I've seen. But there's a lot of room for improvement. I'd like to be able to add the Ubuntu fonts family. More importantly, I'd like some sort of tagging system. ""Collections"" as implemented are burdensome to put it kindly. I have hundreds of books on a device that markets on being able to hold thousands, and I don't always want to have to keyword search to try to sift through them. Finally the web UI for managing devices and especially content is terrible. As a software engineer I'm sympathetic to the dilemma, but as a customer I think they need to put a UI/UX team on this.All criticisms aside I want to re-iterate that the 10th gen Oasis is still by far the best way to read books at this point in time. As nice as the sensory experience of paper books can be, I think for frequent readers the advantages of an eInk reader like the Oasis has overcome the tactile and olfactory deficits.",2 people found this helpful

I searched the internet and all I could find was maybe the battery needed replacing unfortunately you can't replace it on these kindles.  I ended up finding out what the problem was and thought I'd share.  It needed to be plugged directly into the electrical outlet in the wall, no charge bricks, etc., to take a full charge.

Kindle Oasis ‚Äì With 7‚Äù display and page turn buttons,5.0,"Page turn buttons, warm light, and the bump-out: worth it!","Reviewed in the United States üá∫üá∏ on January 6, 2023",Digital Storage Capacity: 32 GB | Offer Type: Lockscreen Ad-Supported | Color: Graphite | Option: Without Kindle Unlimited,True,"I was an early Kindle adopter. I bought the first one, in 2008, and many later models. My Kindle book library is now huge. As in, out of control. So big that if they were all hard copy printed books, I'd end up on one of those hoarder shows. Thank goodness for digital media.What ruined Kindles for me: tablets - first a couple of Fires, then iPads. I love reading on the Kindle app there. Great responsive technology, no page turn lag.  I tried the Kindle Paperwhite - still own one from 2018 - but I hate the slow clunky interface, page turn lag and all.But my eyes are aging. I tried the Oasis, as a supplement to the tablet, especially in the evening to give my tired eyes a break. There are three Oasis features that swung my decision, and they have not disappointed:1.  The warm light e-ink screen. A relief to my old tired eyes. I often pick it up during the day as well as in the evening.2.  The page turn buttons. Comfortable to use, no irritating lag.3.  The bump-out form factor. Easy for me to hold in either hand.The device is light to hold, and I'm happy with the battery life. I've set up two device charging spots in my house, each featuring an Anker premium desktop charger which can power up five devices at once. It's not a problem to plug in the Oasis, which I do often, without paying much attention to the battery level. I tend to keep it topped up.Navigating the interface to find books is IMO still rather clunky, but once I'm there, the reading experience is much better than on the Paperwhite.  I browsed the newly released Kindle Scribe, because I'd love a Kindle with a bigger screen. However, when I saw that it lacks page turn buttons? Hard pass.Oasis gets five stars because it met my expectations.",19 people found this helpful
Kindle Oasis ‚Äì With 7‚Äù display and page turn buttons,5.0,Throw Away Your Reading Glasses?,"Reviewed in the United States on November 26, 2022",Digital Storage Capacity: 8 GB | Offer Type: Lockscreen Ad-Supported | Color: Graphite | Option: Without Kindle Unlimited,True,"5 stars all around minus a minor firmware update!Really diggin' this! Got it yesterday on a killer Black Friday trade-in. I traded-in a generic (Not Paperwhite) 2019 model for an 8GB model here.I am a reader of strictly non-fiction. I do the heavyweight fiction titles, but otherwise I lose interest too quickly. Now the reason why I had a generic Kindle and not a Paperwhite is solely because of the weight. The 2019 Kindle weighs 6.1oz and the REAL selling point of this Oasis was it's 6.6oz, the 7"" screen AND the beloved native Dark Mode.Dark Mode kicks butt! No more reading glasses. No more squinting. I do dark mode EVERYWHERE. The generic 2019 Kindle model did NOT have native dark mode, so I actually used the Offline E-Book Management Tool Calibre to change the CSS coloring on the ebooks. So Yes ... I had full on Dark Mode on the lightest kindle ever made.I've had the Oasis for 1 day, and right now my ONLY critique is how in Dark Mode on the Oasis, everytime you switch pages (with the page refresher on (every 20ish times with the page refresher off) the backlight will flicker off. This didn't happen on the 2019 generic model I'd altered.I like my pages looking very clean, so I'm a big time blow hard on the page refresher. So right now that means I get the backlight flicker EVERYTIME I turn the page. To be honest, it's not a big deal in pitch black, but daytime reading ... I wasn't a fan. So I'm encouraging the devs to delete 1 whopping line of code, as it'd really improve the final UX Kindle Oasis experiences.Other notes: I've been holding out for a Kindle page-turn remote for years. I thought this was a layup via big techs unending ""accessibility"" diatribe. It hasn't happened and probably won't. Also, the Oasis is micro-USB which sucks.I'm putting my money that I'll get used to the backlight flicker during my daytime reading (which I'll be using dark mode for (and I'll also NOT be wearing glasses)).Lastly, it's a nice device. It's not an iPad, but it is nice. As for my Big Book recommendation ... it is Moonwalk: A Memoir by Michael Jackson.",12 people found this helpful
Kindle Oasis ‚Äì With 7‚Äù display and page turn buttons,5.0,An Upgrade is an Upgrade,"Reviewed in the United States on February 1, 2023",Digital Storage Capacity: 32 GB | Offer Type: Lockscreen Ad-Supported | Color: Champagne Gold | Option: Without Kindle Unlimited,True,"I've been using the 2015 Kindle Paperwhite for full transparency for YEARS. I bought this as a birthday present to myself, because I've been eyeing it for a while and just wanted to upgrade (and splurge a little).The best part for me is the responsiveness of when I'm browsing for books. But, this is also coming from someone who's Kindle is 7 years old.There are many people that say the battery life is not great. But, if you use the base settings and turn off the WiFi and Bluetooth connection when you don't need it, I honestly haven't noticed much of a difference in the battery life.** It may also have to do with your reading habits. I read for about 30-45 mins at the end of the day, and then sporadically, I'll read for a few hours at a time. I haven't had to charge it more than 2 times since getting this in November 2022.Overall, I think it's a good product for someone looking to upgrade to a new Kindle with more bells and whistles. Despite it being a bit pricier... I remember paying around $115~ for the Kindle Paperwhite when it came out in 2015.I also recommend getting a screen protector if you don't like fingerprints.",3 people found this helpful

For some, it may not be enough to upgrade; but, for people like me, who enjoy toying with the latest anything that requires electricity, a plug or circuitry, it‚Äôs the hill I‚Äôve chosen to die on.Now, I‚Äôve been a Kindler since maybe the 2nd or 3rd generation keyboard versions and my dread then as it is now is something that I consider a major failure on the part of Amazon as far as back-end is concerned. I have HUNDREDS of books and personal documents. After all these years it is beyond my comprehension why Amazon, who can pride itself on being responsive to customers, has YET to figure out a way to improve the user experience when upgrading to a new Kindle. Credit to Amazon for giving us the ability to dump books on the device instead of the 10-at-a-time method of years past, but it‚Äôs still cumbersome and inartful. When sending books to the Kindle from the website still no indication what has or hasn‚Äôt been sent. How HARD could it be to DIM those books that you've dispatched to your new Kindle, on the web interface, in the event you have to step away? How about a filter showing books that have been read for those who don't even want to see these books in the option to transfer? It seems that there is a filter on the Kindle to show those books, but my reading is that‚Äôs a guess. Suppose I‚Äôve inadvertently jumped to the end of a book I guess that sends up a flair indicating the book has been read when in fact it has not. I‚Äôll do some tinkering to see how helpful this might be.Collections could use some help too ‚Äî if collections are in the cloud, why can‚Äôt we load them like we load books? Maybe I‚Äôve missed it, but the only way to load collections is to go to the device and click each collection, one-at-a-time for download ‚Äî one potato, two potato‚Ä¶Onto my minor annoyances that continue to fester and are now full fledged pet-peeves with basic functionality: Why is it that the time can‚Äôt be updated via a time server or the home router‚Äôs time? Here we are in 2019 and users still need to manually change the time on an electronic device or manually adjust for daylight saving time (DST). Amazon‚Äôs Echo can set timers, reminders, send live images clear around the world with another user or tell you your package has been delivered, but Kindle still can‚Äôt auto-adjust its time. You‚Äôre kidding me, right? No toggle for DST, no time server entry? How does this go on year after year without a thought by those who work on the software for Kindle?Speaking of software, I have not once had my Kindle update itself when plugged in with WiFi turned on. Every update I‚Äôve gotten I‚Äôve had to manually do it ‚Äî annoying. Why is this such a problem for some users and not others? Why can‚Äôt the Kindle alert users automatically if an update is available when syncing or checking or downloading books when online? If the goal is to require the device be plugged in for the update, why not download it to the device and require that the update complete when the device is powered with the cable? Since the battery has such staying power, I may only have to plug my Kindle in 5 times in a year.And to continue this train of thought with plugs and power, why is micro USB still standard on this or ANY newly released Kindle? Did Amazon get a ‚Äúprime day‚Äù deal (see what I did there) on this connectivity method because everyone else has moved on to USB-C and some vendor has a warehouse full of micro-USB connectors? The battery on the Kindle Oasis is phenomenal, but it would be nice to take advantage of the faster charging capabilities of USB-C. It might also allow us to finally get rid of the only micro-USB cord we have hanging around because it‚Äôs only needed for the Kindle.Seriously, after all these years I still say this may be my last upgrade ‚Äî for as my collection grows, the chore of moving everything grows exponentially and my peeves grow. Then I come to my senses (it‚Äôs that hill I mentioned earlier) and press the one-click button ‚Äî you should too, it‚Äôs a great device but as with most things it has its annoyances.",8 people found this helpful

Kindle Oasis ‚Äì With 7‚Äù display and page turn buttons,5.0,I have a Paperwhite but reading on my Oasis feels much better!,"Reviewed in the United States on February 23, 2020",Digital Storage Capacity: 32 GB | Offer Type: Lockscreen Ad-Supported | Color: Graphite | Option: Without Kindle Unlimited,True,"I was really skeptical about buying because of the price tag. Clearly I could've bought several kindle units with just one Kindle Oasis, but alas, I succumbed to enabling friends & lots of sugar and ended up buying one. I've always liked the size of the Paperwhite because I have small hands, but surprisingly, the Oasis was comfortable to hold for long hours and didn't keep on slipping because of the uneven backside.The added inch to the display size was really nice for me as I really liked reading with a smaller font to avoid having to turn the pages more while I read (I know, I am lazy okay). Though when I do have to turn the page, the buttons are GREAT. I used to have this itch to have this physical touch when I read, similar to touching a  physical book's page, so having buttons to tinker with has solved that.The large storage is also pretty neat, especially since I do store and listen to audio books when I can. This allows me to store more before having to delete books or for when I travel without access to the internet. I find this important because the battery seems to last shorter than that of my Paperwhite. I think I only encounter this issue when I have to continuously keep access to my wifi available because I'm downloading an audiobook while reading. That eats up my battery to the point of having to charge within the day! Also, I have noticed that the downloads for audiobooks take atleast twice longer than when I download the same thing on my phone via the audible app. But it's not really a huge issue unless you're planning on doing last minute downloads before riding the plane. (Don't. You probably won't have it finished in time, just download it to your phone if possible)NOTE: Both the kindle and my iPhone are not on 5GHz, are next to each other and with downloads starting at the same time.THE LIGHTING: BEAUTIFUL! I find that unless you've compared it, you wouldn't think there would be a difference but there is. My eyes agree. The ability to alter the backlight really helps when you read in a really dark room. It just feels like I can read longer than I can when I'm just staring at varying shades of gray. The entire display also lights up evenly. Again, you wouldn't think or feel the difference unless you've used both so this isn't something to go to war about, it's just a really nice feel that matches the heart stopping price tag.Now as for the port, as much as a USB-C port would have been nice, I feel like it won't be as easy to be universally connected if that were the case. I've had to borrow or salvage cords because I may have left mine at home, and it was really easy to look for the Oasis' cord than to borrow a USB-C cable. This may change in the future though, but for now I'm okay with it coming the way it came.Oh and how can I forget? IT'S AMBIDEXTROUS! I tend to read for about 6-10 hours a day which usually includes while waiting in line, waiting in the car or some other place, so no wonder my dominant hand gets tired. Flipping my kindle to read using my left hand is a joy. I retain good use of the buttons and when my kindle is mounted on a tablet stand, it works wonders. I don't have to keep on taking it off, if I decide I want to turn and read in a different angle or if someone wants to see a part of what I'm reading. I can share easily because I can just keep on flipping it without issue.So far, this is my take on the Kindle Oasis (coming from an old Paperwhite user). Pretty sure there are other things to cover, but these are the things that personally matters to me. I hope this is useful for those on the fence about buying one.P.S. My friends goaded me into buying the 32GB model and I thought it was going to be too much. But no. If you're going to store audiobooks, please get the 32GB because that will go a long way. Thank you lovely evil friends.",4 people found this helpful
Kindle Oasis ‚Äì With 7‚Äù display and page turn buttons,5.0,LOVE,"Reviewed in the United States on February 6, 2023",Digital Storage Capacity: 32 GB | Offer Type: Without Lockscreen Ads | Color: Champagne Gold | Option: With 3 Months Free Kindle Unlimited,True,I love this kindle! I had a paperweight and it was terrible so I shied away from kindle for awhile. On black Friday I traded in my paperweight for the Oasis and it was a totally different experience. I love the adjustable lighting feature. It helps a lot when reading at night. I love the page turning buttons and I absolutely love that I can disable the touchscreen. There are times where I am reading and cleaning and I accidentally touch the screen and it sends me back 10 pages. The battery life is fantastic. I honestly cannot remember every single feature but I do know it is a great buy for someone who is constantly reading and cannot lug around heavy books. I do want to add that I purchased the ad free Kindle. I highly recommend the ad free version. That was one thing I did not like about my paperweight.,One person found this helpful
Kindle Oasis ‚Äì With 7‚Äù display and page turn buttons,5.0,Love my Updated Kindle,"Reviewed in the United States on July 17, 2022",Digital Storage Capacity: 8 GB | Offer Type: Lockscreen Ad-Supported | Color: Graphite | Option: Without Kindle Unlimited,True,"I have a kindle keyboard that I got in 2011 that is still going strong, but I have wanted an updated version with a light feature for years. I looked into getting the latest paperwhite, but due to mixed reviews, I was hesitant to spring for it (same for the basic version), and the oasis just seemed too costly.Thanks to a Prime day lightening deal, I went with the oasis and LOVE it. It‚Äôs heavier than my initial Kindle because it‚Äôs made of metal rather than plastic, but I‚Äôm okay with that because I know the quality is better. I was hesitant about having an only-touch screen since my kindle has the page turn buttons on each side (and my mom had the original touch screen back in the day that was not that great), so I like that the oasis still has the buttons for page navigation. However, the touch screen has been fabulous, and because there is a border (albeit flush) around the screen, I don‚Äôt accidentally turn the page when gripping the sides of the kindle.  I have read some reviews that are upset about ghosting or flickering when turning pages, but coming from what I had before, sometimes I can‚Äôt even tell the page changed, and it takes me a second to realize the words are different (so I don‚Äôt notice that problem at all). I have also read negative reviews about the battery life, but I can read 4-5 complete novels on my oasis, which is twice as much as I could on my original keyboard version. I always keep the WiFi disabled unless I know I need to update/download something, so if you are having battery life issues, definitely look to that. The settings for font, lighting, spacing, etc. are very similar to what you see on a Kindle app, but I have had no headaches or eye issues with it, unlike the apps due to the use of blue light on other electronic devices.All-in-all, it‚Äôs definitely a great Kindle and a huge upgrade from my original one that is 11+ years old. If you want to update for a new one from a much older kindle, I recommend the oasis for sure, but if your original kindle still works, keep it as a back up or to lend rather than trading it in for minimal credit.UPDATE: When I originally wrote this review, I was able to read a book a day, day after day, and could therefore read 4-5 books in one charge. Now, I am only reading a couple chapters or so a night, and I have come to realize that the battery life is not based on how much content you consume, but the time it takes to do so. Because it seems like this device never truly turns off, I am able to read one book per charge at the rate of reading only a few chapters a day or so. That in mind, I would say look at the battery life as how many days between charges rather than how many books you have read.",13 people found this helpful

Kindle Oasis ‚Äì With 7‚Äù display and page turn buttons,5.0,"So you're asking, why get a kindle nowadays.?","Reviewed in the United States üá∫üá∏ on August 5, 2022",Digital Storage Capacity: 32 GB | Offer Type: Lockscreen Ad-Supported | Color: Graphite | Option: Without Kindle Unlimited,True,"Short answer: kindle app on phone and tablet do not offer the same battery life as a Kindle does whether it is an oasis model or paper white version. Since I've purchased the Kindle I've had to charge my phone a lot less. It's been 3 weeks of moderate usage and my kindle has 85%. To improve battery life you can turn on airplane mode and turn off Bluetooth, which I did not do yet.Bottom line, the phone app is wonderful, but I need my phone for calling and texting more than reading. If this doesn't matter to you as much may be you can skip the kindle device and just use the app.The kindle is great for readers. Layout options include font increase or decrease, margin option, and of course the night light and color warmth feature.The page forward and backwards buttons are a nice touch on the kindle oasis, as is the back of the oasis. Reminds me of a space gray iPhone. Not sure if it's aluminum but has a premium feel compared to the paper white.Some of the downside of the device:Why doesn't this device have a small speaker for audio delivery? I guess Bluetooth speaker can deliver this featureOr headphones, I guess.Micro USB port is ancient technology amazon, please make the next version with USB c like the newest paperwhite. Luckily kindle doesn't need to be charged too often.That's all I can think of for now.For those looking for comparisons between the oasis and the paperwhite I hope this review helps.FYI buttons are not necessary for everyone, I can see this as an accessibility option for someone who might have an impairment where the buttons make the device usable because of the buttons.The usb c feature is nice on the paperwhite. Most phones and even new peripherals are all using usbc nowadays so much easier to find a charging cable.I also found that the paperwhite was smaller by probably half an inch, it's nice to be able to hold the device in one hand.Keep this in mind when making your choice.As for content there are plenty of books on kindle unlimited service. Has improved substantially since its debutGood luck finding the right kindle for your needs.Hope this review helps",11 people found this helpful

So much for its ""vaunted"" battery life.  If I read one(1) book, approx 350 pages, battery goes from 100% to approx 65%.  And yes, WiFi is turned off the whole time.  So I can only read approx 2 books per full charge.Love the digital books we have access to in the 21st century, has saved me a lot of room in my house since it's already full of bookcases.HATE getting a new Kindle, won't ever upgrade again.  Wouldn't have done it again this time if I hadn't wanted page-turn buttons so badly (I hate touch screen for page turning).  I have NEVER had a problem-free experience getting a new Kindle and trying to download my library.  I have approx 1600 books and I just bought a 32gb Oasis.  Just like with the last Kindle I bought, approx 20-30% of the books won't download, no matter what I try, plus other errors.  I've also seen this complaint from others.Amazon engineers need to figure out what the problem is, rather than putting the burden on the user to spend days & weeks trying to get access to a library of books we've paid them for.  There is a complete lack of progress on resolving these ongoing problems trying to download libraries to a new device.  Jeff Bezos can put humans in space but his company can't deliver the library I paid them for to my Kindle device?!  Seriously?!You can only transfer books from the cloud to your Kindle by:1)  From your contents page, can only SELECT ALL for up to 25 books at a time, per page, to deliver to your device.  I have 1587 books, which equals 64 pages of books, so I have to do this 64 times.  And 20-30% of these won't actually download!  Will deliver the ""book cover"" to your device, but the actual book won't open.2)  You can download a book to your PC and transfer via USB, but you can only do ONE book at a time!  And the failed download via Whisper Sync will still show on your device, so now you have two(2) books showing on the device but only one will open.  And no way to get that failed download book cover off your device, since the Remove Download option doesn't show/work for a book that didn't actually download!!At least give us an option to download and transfer via USB my entire cloud library, or 25 at a time, to my PC so I can copy/paste to my Kindle via USB.  This method actually does deliver them to my Kindle device, whereas the Whisper Sync won't download large portions of books to a new Kindle device, just book covers with no book there to open.",4 people found this helpful
Kindle Oasis ‚Äì With 7‚Äù display and page turn buttons,4.0,Good but not as much of an upgrade as expected,"Reviewed in the United States üá∫üá∏ on November 11, 2022",Digital Storage Capacity: 32 GB | Offer Type: Lockscreen Ad-Supported | Color: Graphite | Option: Without Kindle Unlimited,True,"I read so many reviews of the Kindle Oasis‚Ä¶ as well as other Kindles and competitor e-readers. I like this Kindle but it is not as much of an upgrade from my Kindle Paperwhite as expected.I use my Kindle for convenience, so the battery life is fine for me. The amber screen and waterproofing (which I haven‚Äôt tested) are the features I really wanted. I also like the page button option a LOT. On a discount day with additional trade-in compensation, this was with it to me. Without the discounts, I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs worth full price unless the non-blue light option and/or waterproofing are paramount to you.Interface-wise, I notice no improvement over my Paperwhite. Text is clear, but the library organization is clunky and SLOW. Trying to scroll through my library results in, like, the device ‚Äòblinking‚Äô by which I mean it reloads for a moment to load new content which is disruptive and unimpressive.I preferred the white hardware of the Paperwhite and find the smooth metal back of the Oasis to be unnecessarily slick for an expensive device that could be damaged by slipping to the floor.

I liked the small size where it fits in my back pockets of my jeans, and the included cover was nice and durable.  Also, I like that I can take off the cover and it becomes the lightest Kindle that I ever used.But the 4 GB Internal Store was becoming small for my text/magazines/comics use, and I really need Amber Light to reduce the eye strain issue that I'm having.  Thus it was time for me to try out the Gen 3 Oasis.For starters page turning is a lot faster than the Gen 1 Oasis, Amber Light is also a great feature that I can't live without.  I went with the 32 GB Storage so there's plenty of room for text/magazines/comics on the thing.  With that being said, if you are heavy into comics/manga, you might want to find  an e-reader that's has external storage or bigger internal storage.For starters yes it comes with Micro-USB Connector, so many people complain about that.  Honestly the charging at the moment is fast to 100% (about a hour about give or take from 30%), and the transfer speed is fine.  For those who complain about USB-C, I think they either want all their devices to have USB-C or fast charging.  Perhaps Gen 4 Oasis or Gen 5 will have it.  It isn't worth the 1 star reviews that I been seeing.Battery life however is worse than the Gen 1 Oasis.  With my mixed use (low/high brightness, Wi-Fi on some times, an heavy reading times), I need to charge it up once a week.  Gen 1 Oasis it was three/four weeks at times.  If you value battery life, keep the Gen 1 Oasis.Weight is slightly more than the Gen 1 Oasis.  What I don't like about the Gen 3 Oasis is while the battery and everything is in the main Kindle device, you have to pay extra for a cover.  I don't care too much about Waterproof, so I went with the premium leather cover.  That cover feels nice, leagues better than holding the Gen 3 Oasis bare (which by the way the Gen 1 Oasis feel with your bare hands is better).The 7 inch screen is a major draw here.  That extra inch difference just makes a big difference with my reading and my comics.  Yeah, manga can be on the smaller end on the Gen 3 Oasis, but you can see more details without zooming it in (however, I say that manga works best on 8 inch devices and up).  With the really fast page turns for text pages (slightly slower on comics/manga and some magazines with photos, but it's very slight), and the Amber Light feature, my reading experience went up the charts.However, I do miss some of the great features of Gen 1.  Since the Gen 1 was smaller, it was easier to carry it around when you don't have a bag.  You can remove the included Gen 1 cover and you have the lightest Kindle you can get at the time. I like the upgrade to Gen 3, but I do value what the Gen 1 can do over Gen 3.I think it's a good value if you are thinking about upgrading from Gen 1 to Gen 3.  With that being said, for most of the Kindle users I wouldn't get the Oasis.  It's a high-end product for those who do heavy reading and just demand the best of the best. Plus, if you like buttons that turn your page, you are stuck with the Oasis.In the end of the day it will come down to what you are looking for, and your general uses.  If you only read books and no magazines or manga, then the Gen 1 Oasis is great.  If you value a bigger screen plus much bigger storage, then upgrade to the Gen 3 Oasis.",14 people found this helpful
Kindle Oasis ‚Äì With 7‚Äù display and page turn buttons,4.0,Initial thoughts,"Reviewed in the United States üá∫üá∏ on June 3, 2020",Digital Storage Capacity: 32 GB | Offer Type: Lockscreen Ad-Supported | Color: Champagne Gold | Option: Without Kindle Unlimited,True,"Just got my 10th Generation Oasis on June 1, replacing my 8th Gen Oasis. Have to say that I LOVED the charging cover on my old Kindle and never had a problem with it unless I didn't plug the Kindle to the charging cable correctly. I'm going to miss it, also because it made the bottom of the device flat, as opposed to the lump that now exists because of the battery. Oh well, not exactly a first-world problem. You might ask why I upgraded...I had had my old device for almost three years and it just seemed like a good time. The price was pretty good, because I traded in the old device for some $$$ and got a 20% discount on the new one with 32 GB instead of my old 8 GB version. I also got the Ayota cover some other people have mentioned (in Saddle) and I love it. I would have gotten the Amazon leather cover but, once again, they had only black. I was very tired of my black device and cover, which were the color I've had since my first Kindle a very long time ago.Some folks have complained about not getting a new power adapter with their new device...srsly?? Your old adapter had a USB connector, which is what the new cable uses, so just use that. I didn't check, but the old cable might work as well.So far, it's great. I had a little trouble registering the device, but using my phone number instead of my username did the trick. I downloaded the books I haven't read, adjusted my settings (LOVE being able to use left justification with the Oasis!), and started reading. The one nit I have is that I'm not sure how I feel about have to swipe before using the Kindle...every time. Opening the cover wakes up the device, but I'm forced to see whatever ""ad"" is on it before swiping and reading. I did not have to do that with the 8th Gen Oasis with charging cover--just open and start reading. But again, not a first world problem.The bottom line is that I'm happy with the device and happy to be starting with a new device, but not completely sure it was worth the price to do so.UPDATE (9/19/20): I *really* don't like the short battery life! Yeah, it charges quickly...but I don't check every day to see how much life is left, so running out while I'm a passenger or out to dinner just blows. The Kindle with charging cover lasted a VERY long time; this one seems to give out after only 8 hours or so. I'll also add that the aesthetics of this Kindle Oasis with the big battery bump on the bottom are not pleasing. Almost forgot--do not like having to swipe to unlock every.single.time I open the cover--did not have to do that with previous version. It was open the cover to wake/close the cover to sleep, period, and it was the Kindle with ads too.UPDATE 9/28/21: OK, more than a year later than the last update but still less than two years with the device, and I have to say I am soooo disappointed with this Amazon Kindle. The battery situation is just ridiculous. The device absolutely will not charge to 100% anymore--it stops at 96 regardless of how long it's plugged in. Then, after one day of use, it's already down to 42%. I really should have hung onto my previous device with its wonderful charging cover; I can't imagine why people had an issue with that cover. Well, I guess--like most other companies--Amazon no longer cares about quality and just wants to make you keep buying devices.",2 people found this helpful

Kindle Oasis ‚Äì With 7‚Äù display and page turn buttons,4.0,"Great for reading, but SERIOUS battery consumption problem and 32GB model not worth it (UPDATE)","Reviewed in the United States üá∫üá∏ on June 4, 2021",Digital Storage Capacity: 8 GB | Offer Type: Lockscreen Ad-Supported | Color: Graphite | Option: Without Kindle Unlimited,True,"UPDATE 10/4/2021: Amazon seems to have fixed the battery consumption issue (for now), so upping to 4 stars. But beware that the device can become unusable when too many books are loaded. I'm not even at50% of my total 8GB and have noticed some slowness, not to mention manageability of that many titles, which is a failing of the user interface. The battery consumption may have something to do with indexing when you have that many books loaded, and seems to settle down after a while. Additionally, if you do not plan on doing Audible, 32GB continues to be a 100% waste of money as the books take up hardly any space at all.A final thought: HEY AMAZON, how about some AUTOMATIC categorization of content? As it is, Amazon has left it up to the user to create categories (e.g. ""Mystery"", ""Science Fiction"", ""Romance"", etc.) and then MANUALLY move your books into the categories. Really?i?! We didn't sign up to be librarians here. How about a little help with some automatic categorization of purchased content? Since everything is virtual, it sure would also be nice if books spanning multiple genres could appear in multiple categories (folders) when they span genres.ORIGINAL REVIEW: A little background. My first Kindle was the Kindle 2 with keyboard and I loved it! To the point that when the battery was starting to fail, I got my hands dirty and replaced it by taking it apart. Well it finally kicked the bucket about a little over a year ago and I went without for a while, but then decided to pick one up on Prime Day last year. I chose the latest, greatest, flagship model, the Kindle Oasis. Sweet, I thought, backlight, warm colors, touch screen. Couldn't wait to try it out. It was everything I hoped it would be, AT FIRST. Then my opinion began to change. So, this is a WARNING to you all that this Kindle has a SERIOUS PROBLEM with battery life and lagginess/unresponsiveness when you start downloading more than about 100 items from your book library. When I first received it, battery was GREAT - it lasted 5-6 days of reading without a charge. Then I made the mistake of downloading a good portion of my rather large book library. I have the 8GB model and have 4.3 GB free after downloading 1200 books. Makes you wonder what the point of the 32GB mode is, doesn't it? More $$$ for Amazon I guess. Or for Audible content, because I can't imagine how poorly it would run with the 20,000 or so books that it would take to fill up 32GB. That said, I DO NOT have any Audible content downloaded, but now the battery RUNS OUT IN A FEW HOURS! Not kidding. I had a full charge this morning and by 6pm it was down to 3%. Putting it in airplane mode does not help. I don't know what it is doing, but the Kindle has become so laggy and unresponsive that I want to chuck it out the window. Seriously, it's as if the thing is run by some microscopic mouse running in it's tiny wheel to power this thing. Shame on you Amazon for putting some sort of useless processor that is apparently leftover from the 90's, for all the compute power and battery-draining consumption it exhibits.",5 people found this helpful
Kindle Oasis ‚Äì With 7‚Äù display and page turn buttons,3.0,Bad Product. But there doesn't seem to be any other better option available.,"Reviewed in the United States üá∫üá∏ on January 20, 2023",Digital Storage Capacity: 8 GB | Offer Type: Lockscreen Ad-Supported | Color: Graphite | Option: Without Kindle Unlimited,True,"I used a second generation Kindle that had a keyboard and no touchscreen for 12 years. It was the best electronic device I ever bought. The one day it stopped working. So I had to go and buy a new Kindle, and I bought the pricey Oasis.I have been using Kindle Oasis for over 6 months now. So this review is not my first impression. The good part about it is that it is light weight. The backlight is useful, so you don't have to use a booklight if  you are reading in the dark. I looks good, unlike the other cheaper version that is currently which looks very cheap in quality. I guess those are the only good things about the device.There are my problems with this device, which I have listed below. I have accepted and learned to live with these issues, but it just makes me disappointed that the latest version of a device should have so many negatives.1. You do now know where the touch screen ends. So you keep inadvertently touching the screen and flipping pages or going to the menu2. The device is so sleek that it keeps slipping from your hand, especially if you are reading in a lying position3. The navigation with the touch screen is confusing. Sometime you are reading a book, and it becomes difficult to go to your home page4.  It is difficult to select a passage for highlighting using touchscreen, especially if the passage spans across pages.DO NOT BE FOOLED BY AN AVERAGE RATING OF 4 STARS.Amazon does not take simple average of ratings, which essentially means that they manipulate the rating. If you read reviews, most people have rated this version poorly.Unfortunately there are no better Kindle versions available at present. Amazon started with a great product 13 years ago and have successively made it worse. We just have to live with it, until another competitor comes with a better product that ends Amazon's monopoly on digital reading devices.",One person found this helpful
Kindle Oasis ‚Äì With 7‚Äù display and page turn buttons,2.0,"Sub Par - by now, Kindles should be amazing.","Reviewed in the United States üá∫üá∏ on January 16, 2021",Digital Storage Capacity: 8 GB | Offer Type: Lockscreen Ad-Supported | Color: Graphite | Option: Without Kindle Unlimited,True,"When Kindle first came out - I was excited.  I hated books with cheap newsprint paper where the ink came off on your hands.  Kindle was also backed by Amazon - which mean it would be there years and years where other readers might not.What I didn't like about the early Kindles was that it was slow and the back ground was grey - yech!  I have bought 4 of these over the years as they improved - inlacing this one.Pros:Audiolarge selection of booksslightly (but not by much) better graphicsinsanely good battery lifeSame quality fontsLight weight, decent design.Audio (read by someone other than kindle) is decent.Lighting: this is in cons below but I add it here as it is slightly better than the previous lighting on older kindles where you have a few super bright spots that distracted from your reading.  Now they have 25 LEDs that appear to be smoother.ConsPaper white (...?? really? where?!)I kept hearing about how this was going to be PAPER WHITE but it never was!  With LED light off - it TERRIBLE!  I do mean terrible!  What I like about real paperbacks or hardcover novels is the white paper on which the words are printed.  I thought by now we would have a nice white background when the back light is off.  Nope - it's actually worse that the first Kindle.  if you are in a day lit room with the auto adjust on, it does improve - BUT YOU STILL SEE THE LIGHTS!  I hated two of the ones I purchased a few years back as you how bright spots where the LEDS WERE.  THAT WAS ANNOYING!  OASIS IS A BIT BETTE WITH 25 LEDS - BUT NOT by much.Design: While the design is decent - the placement of those buttons is terrible.  it would have been better to leave them and continue using the screen touch to turn the page.  you will accidentally hit them and turn the page when you don't want to turn the page.  the point of the wide margin pane is so you can hold it easier - yet you are always trying to avoid hitting those poorly placed buttons.  to avoid hitting them - you are forced to put your thumb onto the screen - which is the the reason they added the side panel!Speed: painfully slow.  it is shocking how slow this device is.  There is no excuse for that.  Amazon will make money on all the books sold - this should be something far better by now.Software is still clunky.  What can be said.  Everything from setting it up to searches is terrible.  I searched for a book by the EXACT title a few times - it say no such ting existed.  I went to Amazon.com - entered the same search, all the books showed up and then I sent them to the kindle.  this is a joke at best.  I signed up for Kindle Unlimited - three free months.  it never worked.  I called customer service (and this is now a complete joke.  if something does not work - forget contacting Amazon!  with all that money, you would think BASIC QUESTIONs could be answered.  Mine was simple - did I sign up for the free trail (yes - I selected this when I set up my Kindle but it never showed up anywhere) -  they past to three different customer service reps - with the last one saying there was no one there who could help me.  WHAT?!?  Worst. you will ever find!I selected settings, then auto brightness.  that work for a brief period of time.  I simply adjust the light to see the different lighting options.  When I was done - I set it back to auto adjust.  auto adjust stopped working and nothing I could do would get it to work again - it just kept the last setting I entered.So software is poor - customer service is a complete waste or time.Audio (text read by the kindle) : harry - went  -TO - the - store...is terrible.  very robotic.  But I guess the tech is far from working - no matter what company tries to use it.Cost: Very expensive for slow device with super dark grey background.power charger : USB Mini?! ARE YOU KIDDING ME?!  This should tell you how little improvement went into this device.Over allMy two star rating is due to this device needing to be far better than it is - especially for the price (with tax - nearly three hundred dollars!).  To be this slow and mediocre with very little improvement from even the Kindle from 10 years ago is just inexcusable. I have 4 kindles that are old and just as good as this one. With each new version of Kindle - very little improvement takes place.  For example, the older Kindles had a frame around the screen with dirt and whatever would get trapped.  it was annoying.  Amazon released an upgrade where that frame was gone - it was a smooth glass over the entire front - making that problem better.  but the rest of the device did very little to make it better.  if you have an old Kindle - stay with it!  Wait for a version of this that actually wows people.  It just seems with very little competition in this industry - there is no sense of urgency to make this better.  Each upgrade seems to put a tiny bit of improvement into it.",3 people found this helpful

Kindle Oasis ‚Äì With 7‚Äù display and page turn buttons,5.0,Worth buying if you want reading to be a main part of your life with real enjoyment.,"Reviewed in the United States on September 18, 2020",Digital Storage Capacity: 32 GB | Offer Type: Lockscreen Ad-Supported | Color: Graphite | Option: Without Kindle Unlimited,True,"This device is worth it. It simply is, even with the higher price tag. If you only read casually, don't bother--just keep using your phone, tablet, or laptop to read electronically. However, if you want to make reading a regular meaningful experience in your life, invest more for this device. The main features that set this apart from the Kindle Paperwhite, making the Oasis in a class of its own, are these:1. The warmth slider. This truly makes the device easy and inviting to your eyes in any lighting environment, especially in the dark. It feels like having a car seat warmer when it's cold outside. The warmth slider nearly justifies the price of the Oasis all on its own. It makes that much of a difference to me. Without it, everything is a bit ""cold"".2. The bigger screen. Some people say the paperwhite has a more ideal screen size, because you can fit it in your pocket; however, why would you keep your kindle in your pocket? Why would that be a goal? In my mind, the larger screen on the Oasis is still a very portable form factor, but it's superior to the Paperwhite since its larger screen is closer to the size of a real book page. To me, the Oasis screen size is 'just right' for a device that is intended for dedicated reading (not casual reading when you're out-and-about, which could be done more conveniently with your phone anyway).3. Having significantly more internal side lights. This device has many more lights to keep the screen very consistently lit. It has an even lighting all across the display. You especially notice this in the dark. The consistent lighting and the warmth slider make this display simply better than the Paperwhite. You can make your room pitch black and read the Oasis in complete comfort.4. The page turning buttons, and asymetrical shape for shifting the weight towards your main holding hand, are nice design choices. You notice them more over longer reading sessions. These aren't essential, but they are a nice addition.-------------------Other thoughts:Some people complain that the battery life is lower than the Paperwhite. It is lower; however, the battery life is still really good. You don't need a device to last weeks on a single charge. You just don't. You charge your phone every single night by taking 5 seconds to put it on the charging cable. Treat the Oasis like that every few days, if your use is heavy. It's not that big of a deal. You spend hours unconscious every single night, so if you take a few seconds to plug the Oasis in, then you'll never have issues. It'll last many days in a row, regardless. It's okay to sacrifice some battery life for an objectively superior reading experience over the Paperwhite. I can confirm that.If you're going to invest in a device for electronic reading, and you want that device's experience to justify itself over a real book, why not make it a truly inviting experience? Otherwise, you might as well keep reading physical books. To me, an E-Reader is like a gaming PC. If you're going to buy one, properly invest your money so your experience is great (not just passable). If you love reading, or you want to MAKE reading a regular part of your life, the Kindle Oasis is a worthy purchase.",9 people found this helpful
Kindle Oasis ‚Äì With 7‚Äù display and page turn buttons,4.0,Loving the thinness and page buttons,"Reviewed in the United States on January 31, 2022",Digital Storage Capacity: 32 GB | Offer Type: Lockscreen Ad-Supported | Color: Champagne Gold | Option: Without Kindle Unlimited,True,"Paperwhite is a good solid choice that I enjoyed very much. I upgraded to the Oasis because I wanted the thinner book that seemed easier to hold. I like the buttons very much for page turning. I think I like the adjustment of color shade of light as the more golden tone is easier on the eyes. What sold me is the audible, but I hate it in actual use. I will continue to use my iphone for audible instead. The sound control for volume is really awful. 1 hardly makes a sound, 2 is much louder but just on the cusp of having to strain to hear and 3 blows your eardrum out, what is the point of 4 through 10.  The battery is constantly needing charging that I now make a point to charge it every night after I'm done reading for the night. I even have a long charging cable near my bed for the few times it got critically low while reading. I never had that issue with my Paperwhite. I was hitting the screen more accidentally than before. There is a turn off screen touch feature, but it requires a few clicks to get to it and gets turned off when you close the book. I had no ads on my Paperwhite and I'm really annoyed now with ads. I want to open my book and read, but now it needs a swipe with a long pause to open. If you do press the show me more for the book being advertised be prepared to have your kindle reboot. So annoying. But maybe it does that on the Paperwhite, I don't know. I was hoping for a better interface as I'm having such a difficult time seeing the covers and reading the titles with the tiny font and low contrast. Still the same issue, if not worse with the more yellow tint. The Oasis is very slippery without a cover. I do recommend the leather Amazon cover, except that the price is higher than it seems to be worth. Then again, so is the Oasis. Paperwhite is a smarter choice. The back light on both is similar. I never had flicker issues with any of my Paperwhites. My Oasis has flickered. I hope it lasts since it was such an expensive purchase. I bought the higher storage content, again for my audible books. That was silly. I have more pages of books than I care to scroll through and there is no quick way to get back to page 1, least not that I've found. Sorting to unlimited takes you back down to just a couple of pages in your library that can get back to page 1 and then sort back to everything. Library needs more attention if you ask me. But the reader is for reading, and the Oasis is nice for it is slightly more comfortable to hold and the lighting is easier on the eyes. I'm happy enough with the purchase.",

Kindle Oasis ‚Äì With 7‚Äù display and page turn buttons,5.0,This is *the* Kindle.,"Reviewed in the United States on July 27, 2022",Digital Storage Capacity: 8 GB | Offer Type: Lockscreen Ad-Supported | Color: Graphite | Option: Without Kindle Unlimited,True,"I had never owned a Kindle before, and I've been meaning to disconnect from social media, and iPads can be a distraction (even when having Focus Mode) so on Prime Day I decided to purchase a Kindle.I actually purchased all 3 Kindles, Basic, Paperwhite and Oasis. And after a few days of testing I have to say that the Oasis is *the* Kindle.Even tho the new Paperwhite is less expensive and have basically the same features (plus USB-C), the Oasis won me over on build quality. The aluminum build is and feels more premium. And I love the buttons and how ergonomic the thicker area is. I know this has been a love-it-or-hate-it kind of thing, but personally I loved the thicker area as a handle. Reading feels natural with the Oasis.Did I sacrifice USB-C for micro USB? Sure, but then again a single charge should hold for about a month, so it's not like I have to even carry the charging cable if going on a weekend trip, or even a whole week vacation.Even tho you can't technically go wrong with any Kindle (they all run same software), the better LEDs, build quality, and ergonomic handle truly make worth spending a bit more for the Oasis.The only nitpick I have is the massive Amazon logo on the back. Sure, they want to do organic marketing by putting the big logo, but this is more of a higher end reading device, the logo should've been minimal, if any at all.Amazon, if you're reading this: the next Oasis should have USB-C, perhaps a faster processor (I do notice the difference between the new Papwerwhite and Oasis), and maybe thinner bezels and you may have the perfect reading device. But keep the handle, the one sided buttons (as it it amazing for switching hands), and thinner profile. This is truly the ""Air"" brand of Kindles.",One person found this helpful

Kindle Oasis ‚Äì With 7‚Äù display and page turn buttons,2.0,The jury is still out on this one-Update Returned it,"Reviewed in the United States on December 2, 2022",Digital Storage Capacity: 8 GB | Offer Type: Lockscreen Ad-Supported | Color: Graphite | Option: Without Kindle Unlimited,True,"Update-I ended up returning this item for the reasons listed below, as well as the mystifying non-inclusion of a Power adapter ($20 extra bucks), and a USB-C connector not being available (and thus obviously not included despite this machine coming out AFTER the Kindle HD10 Plus that has the USB-C connector).Not sure I understand a $249 price tag (It does go on sale periodically), that doesn't include those things when a Kindle Fire HD10 Plus that I just paid $70 bucks for with trade in, does.  To me at least, it made no sense to pay 2-3 TIMES the price of a 10"" HD Fire, for a black and white E-Ink dedicated reader the size of a piece of bread, then have to shell out $20 more for a Power adapter if you want another option for charging the device besides the USB port on your computer, and not the latest technology on the charging cable.If you are going to charge a premium price, include premium features.For some people, it makes sense, I am just not one of them.Original Review-I am a big Kindle fan, but have always used a Fire because to me, why get just an e-reader if you can get a full-color HD tablet with a Kindle app for less money? But, as others have stated, I never use the Fire for anything but reading. My iPhone is a far more functional device than the Fire for tasks other than reading,  and if I need more than my iPhone, I would just go to my desktop, not the Fire.Plus, I am an avid reader and when I saw all the positive reviews about it being a ‚Äòdedicated reading device‚Äô from other avid readers, I decided to give it a try.My first response when I saw it was, where‚Äôs the rest of it?It‚Äôs about the size of a piece of bread. Which is nice as far as weight, but is actually less comfortable for me because it is so small that holding it is more difficult than if it were a bit larger.The screen clarity is superb and the lighting is perfect if your spouse is asleep next you, not too bright, but bright enough. The page buttons are great, but I switched mine because when you get to the bottom of the page, I thought the lower button made more sense as the ‚Äònext page‚Äô option. I love how you can just flip the device over to switch hands (and the page turning button side for lefties) as well.The interface with the users Kindle library definitely needs work as do the onboarding instructions. You‚Äôre pretty much left figuring it out on your own, which, as a longtime Kindle Fire user I thought would be no problem, I was wrong. So, I had to pull up the user guide, which was not helpful because it describes how to achieve things instead of showing you how. For instance, the user guide tells you to click the home tab to pull up your Kindle library without telling you how to reach the screen where the home tab resides (tapping on the screen). So, assumptions are made that you should be able to figure it out yourself, and I did, once I decided to completely ignore the user guide. That onboarding experience is surprising given Amazon‚Äôs extensive experience selling these devices. I like the Oasis, but I am not yet sold on whether it is worth twice the cost of a Fire HD10.I am still considering returning it, but will most likely end up not doing so as I become more familiar with it.",2 people found this helpful

Kindle Oasis ‚Äì With 7‚Äù display and page turn buttons,4.0,The first ereader that feels completely natural to read,"Reviewed in the United States on October 7, 2022",Digital Storage Capacity: 32 GB | Offer Type: Lockscreen Ad-Supported | Color: Champagne Gold | Option: Without Kindle Unlimited,True,"It‚Äôs effortless to read on:  Lightweight-even with a cover, paperwhite display-so no eye strain, backlit with customizable warmth which when added to the standard font adjustment all readers have mean I read all day and night without a headache.  It even adjusts top over bottom when you change hands-the one thing my phone did better than any reader. I prefer the button turn option so getting a device where the buttons line up naturally where I hold is perfect for me.  I haven‚Äôt tried the Bluetooth headset connection but I‚Äôm glad it‚Äôs an option.  Problems-1 day reading drained the battery and the slow charging port takes a while to get it back to 100%.  Sure I can switch to my phone reader-but I don‚Äôt like the display as much or my pad -but after trying the oasis it feels really heavy.  I wish you had the wireless fast charge as an option.

I‚Äôve found it so convenient especially on trips or vacation. If it fits perfectly in my laptop bag and is extremely portable lightweight and has excellent battery life.,
Kindle Oasis ‚Äì With 7‚Äù display and page turn buttons,5.0,A Perfect Medium For Book Lovers,"Reviewed in the United States on July 30, 2019",Digital Storage Capacity: 8 GB | Offer Type: Lockscreen Ad-Supported | Color: Graphite | Option: Without Kindle Unlimited,True,"I enjoy reading physical books. I also enjoy the convenience of a digital device. This Kindle Oasis is a perfect medium between the two.‚Äî WARM LIGHT ‚ÄîA warm light option is the newest feature of the Oasis, and in my opinion, a feature that helps replicate the book experience. Previous LED lights lighting up the screen were cooler in color. This made it feel like looking at a computer screen. Now, with warm lights it more closely replicates the color of book pages! I personally set it to the warmest setting so it looks like an aged book.You have the option of setting a schedule for when the warm light turns on. For me, I leave the warm option always on.‚Äî BRIGHTNESS ‚ÄîThere are 25 LEDs to light up the screen. Honestly, I thought 4 LEDs were fine in the Paperwhite and lit the screen evenly, but I guess 25 is better! The screen in comfortable to read no matter the time of day. There is an option to have it auto-adjust the brightness which is very helpful.‚Äî BIGGER SCREEN ‚ÄîThe larger 7‚Äù screen is another selling point for me. With a bigger screen and a smaller bezel, it feels closer to reading a book page. The bigger screen also means more words can fit, meaning less page turns, means less battery usage.‚Äî BATTERY ‚ÄîHow often you have to recharge is dependant on how often you read. For me, I read a few hours a day and it lasts about two weeks before the next recharge.‚Äî THE BUTTONS ‚ÄîI know some people love the buttons to turn pages and I‚Äôm trying to get used to it. I hold my Oasis in a way where my thumbs accidentally hit the buttons so it gets annoying, but I‚Äôve found that holding your thumb *between* the two buttons is the most optimal if you wish to use the buttons. I wish there was a way to deactivate the buttons because I‚Äôd rather swipe the screen. This is a personal preference and doesn‚Äôt affect my rating.‚Äî THINGS TO NOTE ‚ÄîThere are a couple of things that I noticed different from the Paperwhite. One, there is a slight delay in waking up the device. It‚Äôs about an additional second or two to wake it up if you haven‚Äôt used it in a while. Two, it feels slightly faster when turning pages. Those are the main two things for me.‚Äî ACCESSORIES ‚ÄîI recommend getting the NuPro screen protector to avoid damaging your screen, and a case if you prefer to keep your Oasis looking like new, and for resale value.‚Äî UPGRADE ‚ÄîIf you have the option to trade in your old Kindle, along with Amazon giving you a discount towards buying a new one, I highly recommend doing so. It makes the premium price much easier to swallow.‚Äî SUMMARY ‚ÄîYes, the Oasis is a splurge. But for those that want the convenience of having all their books in one device, along with wanting a device that duplicates a book reading experience, the Kindle Oasis comes pretty close.

Kindle Oasis ‚Äì With 7‚Äù display and page turn buttons,4.0,Worth the upgrade,"Reviewed in the United States on September 14, 2020",Digital Storage Capacity: 32 GB | Offer Type: Lockscreen Ad-Supported | Color: Graphite | Option: Without Kindle Unlimited,True,"I will start by saying I have not used an ereader device in many years. I initially had a nook color but was so disappointed in it, I hardly used it. I pretty much just read from my phone (Kindle and Overdrive apps) and occasionally from my laptop. Recently, some folks from a book club convinced me to try ereaders again. When I started shopping around, pretty much everyone said the Oasis was 100% worth it even with the high price tag.As far as performance, it certainly delivers. The battery life is pretty good. It lasts about 3-4 days (however, that is with me reading for 3-4 hours at a time sometimes and also throughout the day whenever I can, so basically constant use. I imagine I could still get more out of the battery if I optimized the settings (turning the backlighting and warmth setting to 0) , but I don't mind charging every few days. And the light settings I have right now are just right.The charger is FAST. I'm not sure if it's a combination of the outlet I use or if it's just the cord (I've only used the one it comes with so far), but this thing charges SO fast. I can put it to charge, take a shower, and it's already at 80%. And I honestly did not mind that it only comes with a cord and not a wall port. We have multi-port plugs all over the house, so I did not miss it.Reading experience... It's SO lightweight, so thin and easy to hold. The only problem, is that this is only the case when you are holding it flat on your palm (which for me is never). I like to read curled up on the couch and have also taken to reading while taking a bubble bath thanks to the waterproof feature, and it just doesn't work. The material is so smooth and seamless, it just slips out of your hand if you're trying to read in bed (unless you have a deathgrip on it, which defeats of the purpose of reading to wind down), thus I am giving 4 stars. This was easy to get around though. I also got a faux leather case I found on amazon which feels nice in the hand and adds a tad more weight, which I like, and a set of mini popsockets. I put two of them on the back along the bevel and it's perfect.Overall, the reviews are right, it is definitely a worthwhile investment if you are an avid reader with an extensive ebook collection. I tore through 3 entire trilogies in my first two weeks of owning this thing. It makes reading ebooks a MUCH better experience than a phone/tablet. Some mentioned that it wouldn't be worthwhile if you already own, say, the latest or second-to-latest Paperwhite or Kobo, and with that I agree. The price tag is up there, so it may not be worth the upgrade in that case. But for me, I am loving my Oasis.",One person found this helpful

Kindle Oasis ‚Äì With 7‚Äù display and page turn buttons,4.0,"Graert Features, Not so easy to hold and Amazon support lacks","Reviewed in the United States on October 20, 2019",Digital Storage Capacity: 8 GB | Offer Type: Lockscreen Ad-Supported | Color: Graphite | Option: Without Kindle Unlimited,True,"I traded in my older Paperwhite and recieved $25 gift card but NEVER was able to apply the 25% off I was to receive. I had ABSOLUTELY no option to apply 25% off on purchase. When I contacted chat for issue I spent 10 minutes chatting and sending proof that I was to receive 25% off and was transferred to a different department. Went through 10 more minutes of chat to be transferred AGAIN. The person I chatted with wanted to see my email stating I was to receive 25% off. I told I just wanted to cancel my order as I was told by a prior chat I could use 25% off on another qualifying device by end of November. NOT what I want. I do not plan to purchase another device. The person promised me he would follow my purchase and once it ships he would apply my 25% off the device. I spent almost an hour chatting and being transfered. Well, he did not do that and I NEVER received anyyemail stating I iwas being refunded 25% like I was promised. Nor was I ever told if my credit card was being credited or if I would get store credit.  I can't give AMAZON's support a low enough rating as 0 starts is TOO High of a rating for this situation. I was given a false promise.As far as the OASIS goes. I love that larger screen with more LED's. Being a glass screen and more LED's makes the screen so sharp and clear. Much sharper than my old Voyage which is sharp. The adjustable warm light is fantastic. I love that in the evening when I read as it is so soft on the eyes. The page press buttons are a wonderful feature that I missed from my first kindle which had them. I would rather they be like to old kindle keyboard buttons on both sides. If they were to make the oasis more like a regualar kindle with the larger screen, aluminum body, glass screen, 25 LED's with adjustable arm light and page press buttons on both sides it would be a FANTASTIC Kindle. My VOYAGE has metal body, glass screen and page press which unfortunately are not actual buttons but it is a great reader as so much brighter and sharper than the Paperwhite.I am not keen on the design with the one wide and thick edge with the page press buttons as I like to switch hands while reading. This is going to take a bit of time to get used to. I have trouble holding with my right hand only (and I'm right handed) and can only hold with left hand only. Also I get tired off holding with one hand only. Because of the design with  not enough of a boarder on top bottom and one side making harder to hold with 2 hands unless you have cover and hold like a book.  Problem I have with that is the newer Amazon covers are so thin that the edges are thin and dig into your hand which after a short time begins too bother me almost hurting. Being able to flip over and screen flipping automatically is great but when I hold with left hand the power button is easily pressed if not careful and will go into a screensaver mode.",

Kindle Oasis ‚Äì With 7‚Äù display and page turn buttons,3.0,"I don't like it, wish I would have returned it!","Reviewed in the United States on January 24, 2023",,True,"I've had many kindles, and I usually love them. My favorite kindle was my first one, the one with the keyboard and the page turning buttons. That's the reason I bought this one, the buttons, I feel like the kindle designers know that we like the buttons but they threw in a bunch of other features to make it more expensive. First complaint is that both buttons are on the same side, which isn't ideal. I honestly don't use this kindle much, mostly because the battery life is horrible, it's almost useless. I am used to my older kindles some of which lasted weeks, I had a paperwhite which lasted over a week with very heavy use, I only bought this one because my paperwhite stopped charging. This kindle barely last a day.  I've had it for a while now, but i don't use it, it's just easier to read on my phone.  I'm very disappointed with it. I don't really care about it being waterproof, in the past I've just put my kindle in a ziplock to read while in the water. And yes, i tried the suggestions to save on battery life, didn't help much, and shouldn't be necessary in the first place. At this price point I would expect better.",2 people found this helpful

Kindle Oasis ‚Äì With 7‚Äù display and page turn buttons,4.0,"Good, solid device","Reviewed in the United States on January 25, 2020",Digital Storage Capacity: 32 GB | Offer Type: Lockscreen Ad-Supported | Color: Champagne Gold | Option: Without Kindle Unlimited,True,"This is a good device. I recently upgraded from the Voyage. The Oasis met my expectations. It's very comparable to my Voyage. The only major upgrades in my opinion is the black screen (inverted) option and the warm light. The rest of it seems of the same quality to me. I will say that I preferred the size of my voyage. The Oasis is a much different width and is weighted differently which makes it a little wonky at times but I've mostly gotten used to it. The page turn buttons are much better than on my previous device. I don't have to press hard at all. They do make a clicking noise when pressing, not sure if that's just my unit or all of them, but it's tolerable. As far as value, nah, this isn't it. We have 4 paperwhite in the house that I use at times as well, all varying versions. The Oasis is nice but it's not $300 nice. If I had to do it again I'd just get the newest paperwhite. I prefer the glass screen of the oasis and the dark/warm screen options, etc but it's not worth the difference in price. Just my 2 cents.So that's the device. Now, getting my device (my $300 device mind you) from Amazon was a HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE experience. I placed my order and it never shipped. I never got an email saying there was a delay or anything, the status just went to ""expected January 5th"" and never changed, while the device never arrived. I contacted Amazon repeatedly to try to find out when it was arriving or what was going on and could never get a straight answer from anyone, including the supervisor I spoke with who promised she'd look into the problem and get back to me. Of course, I never heard another word from anyone. This was intended as a gift, but I wound up giving something else instead when my gift never arrived. I finally ordered a 2nd one, which I planned to do anyway as I was ready for an upgrade. It arrived the very next day. 10 days after my original order, which never arrived, I get an automated email saying it finally shipped. I was able to cancel it midstream so I didn't have to return it, but it was the most horrible experience I've ever had with a customer service team. They literally could not answer a single question, they wouldn't initiate contact with whatever department broke down the fulfillment process, and they couldn't have cared less if it ever arrived, if I ever got another kindle device from them, or if I ever did business with Amazon again.So my take away is this,  if it's an important purchase or a gift, don't order it from Amazon. If you MUST order from Amazon do so months in advance because they will not help in any way if something breaks down in their internal processes. At all. Like, don't even bother calling. Their screens only show what yours does (as they kept letting me know) and they seemingly have neither the ability nor the desire to resolve their own issues internally.",

Kindle Oasis ‚Äì With 7‚Äù display and page turn buttons,1.0,3nd UPDATE:  CONSENSUS: BATTERY LIFE REMAINS POOR,"Reviewed in the United States on August 5, 2019",Digital Storage Capacity: 32 GB | Offer Type: Lockscreen Ad-Supported | Color: Graphite | Option: Without Kindle Unlimited,True,"The bigger format is welcome. It adds some to the physical size and weight, but for these mature eyes, I think the trade off is positive. I often read laying on my side and really like that the view flips so I can tent the device laying on either side.  I‚Äôm a bit mixed about the bump out. I‚Äôm leaning to like the totally flat design of my prior Kindles, but think I‚Äôll get used to it. The touch screen is noticeably better, but it could hardly be worse and is still not as reliable or responsive as one would expect. The format of the pass code entry is noticeably bigger and helps to avoid entry errors. This charging cord is too short to charge while reading. This is a huge disappointment as it looks like to buy a 6‚Äô cord is pretty expensive.  A comment the a prior iteration of this post references finding cheap 6‚Äô Cords. Perhaps. But I suspect Amazon chose a cheap manufacturing option and will soon be in a fix with this battery. Other reviewers were annoyed that this does not use a USB-C. I travel a lot so cutting down on device clutter is important. Right now my iPad and laptop have the new USB-c and I‚Äôm sure my next phone will, too. But I‚Äôll still need an older usb for other rechargeables like ear pods, flashlight and speaker. THE KILL FACTOR: battery lasts about 4 days with modest use as opposed to ‚Äòseveral weeks‚Äô as advertised. This is replacing a well used Voyage that had very good battery life.  It looses 2-3% while turned off for a few hours. I tried 3 times to return it in the normal way. It seemed like I was able to return for replacement, but I never got a shipping label. Finally talked to a tech who said someone would call to ask me some questions. I gather they are trying to determine if this is an isolated problem (I notice several other battery life complaints) or a bigger problem with the battery design or a batch of batteries. They did promise a replacement in 4 days, which is pretty poor since I‚Äôm a prime member.  One would also think they‚Äôd be very responsive as this may be a really big problem, but apparently they are not very anxious to please.UPDATE:  A replacement was received 5 days ago.  It came essentially in a ""brown bag,"" so I was a bit suspicious that it is not new.  But trying to be optimistic and really wanting this new Kindle to be a keeper, I reasoned that if it was a repaired one, perhaps it works.  In first couple of days, the battery life dropped like a rock.  Three days ago, I recharged and started a new book.  When I quit reading sometime after midnight today, I was 56% through the book and there was 30% power. I checked at 8:30am (after no usage for several hours) and the battery had dropped to 23%.  I just checked again at 4:45pm after no usage and the battery shows 21%.  What are the odds that I get 2 lemons?  Seem pretty low to me.  I read some of Amazon's remarks to complaints about the reader taking extra time when new to index and load books, it needing to be restarted, etc.  I do not recall this happening previously, so I am suspicious about this explanation. Also, a basic of product design is to warn of dangers and how to avoid them. If usage is not intuitive, the manufacturer should instruct.  One way or the other, it seems like Amazon has failed with at least some of this model.  But I'm going to recharge and give it a chance.  At this point I am very discouraged and really suspect about the battery design and the reviews that say they love this new Kindle.The 2nd Kindle was returned due to almost identical abysmal battery performance.  I keep checking back, hoping that there has been a recall or fix on this. As a voracious reader, I‚Äôd love to have the warm light feature. Likewise, I found several other features attractive. It appears, for many, battery life remains a significant problem and Amazon remains silent.3rd UPDATE My original purchases were in 2019. I‚Äôd dearly love to buy this reader mainly due to the warm screen capability and the flipable page which I really liked for reading laying on different sides in bed. So here it is Christmas 2021 and I‚Äôve just reviewed many reviews, especially as they pertain to battery life and customer service. Representation of battery life vs user experience vary wildly. It‚Äôs hard to believe so many would negatively misrepresent battery life. But most of us have heard stories about ringer reviews.So I‚Äôm believing battery life is still poor and over represented.  I also noticed some users reported after only a day‚Äôs ownership. Really? Others outright say battery life is misrepresented. I noted Numerous reports of returned readers being replaced with refurbished readers with no improvement and that A will not replace a second time. So, if you really only use a reader 30 minutes a day, this all may be ok with you. But if that‚Äôs the case, I‚Äôd suggest you don‚Äôt need a high end reader. BUYER BEWARE. Don‚Äôt just count the stars. Read lots of reviews before buying this lemon.

Kindle Oasis ‚Äì With 7‚Äù display and page turn buttons,4.0,"Big strides Amazon, big strides.","Reviewed in the United States on September 1, 2021",Digital Storage Capacity: 8 GB | Offer Type: Lockscreen Ad-Supported | Color: Graphite | Option: Without Kindle Unlimited,True,"The latest generation Oasis is, albeit a minor upgrade from the last generation, still quite a game changer. I myself own and used the original Kindle from 2007 and a Paperwhite from 2013 very often (and own countless other Kindle and Amazon products), so when I was offered to have a free Kindle Oasis with case sent to me in a gift box by Amazon, I took it up.The packaging was very easy to open and the device immediately felt supremely high quality, a definitely quality upgrade from their lower end devices. It was easy to get it attached to my WiFi and log into my account. The 7"" screen may not seem like a big deal to many, but to me it makes reading graphic novels much more doable. The color warmth feature is also a handy feature, and I always have it on to more closely mimic the color of an old-iah book.Audible support is nice though I don't use Audible much myself due to the high costs associated with buying Audible books and a lack of support for audio over the USB port. Speaking of USB, it's micro USB. Some complain it being out of date, but for a device you don't charge often, it doesn't mean much.I wish battery life was better however, as it's not quite as good as my Paperwhite but is still fine. Charging doesn't take long, and that's more than fine for me as a compensation.The return of physical page turn buttons is very much welcome, but they don't work quite the same as they did on Kindle (1st Generation), but it's easy to get used to. They're quite clicky and unlike my first generation Kindle are hard to press by accident. Just wish they were a bit closer together.Waterproofing is on this generation and the last one, and it's useful for when you read in the tub or, preferably, near a drink of water or soda. Tested it a few times already and it has never failed me. Lastly, I wish this Kindle had support for showing reading statistics of the currently read book like some competitors of this device. In addition, with the 5.13.7 update, some text and whatnot is a bit on the small side.Overall it's an amazing device, and I await Amazon's next page when it comes to the Kindle.Thank you Kindle team for supporting the Kindle ecosystem for over a decade, and the first generation device for as long as you have.-Alex M.",One person found this helpful

Kindle Oasis ‚Äì With 7‚Äù display and page turn buttons,4.0,Would Love to Give 5 Stars but....battery.,"Reviewed in the United States on July 22, 2022",Digital Storage Capacity: 32 GB | Offer Type: Lockscreen Ad-Supported | Color: Graphite | Option: Without Kindle Unlimited,True,"I have owned several Kindle readers over the years as I typically purchase a new one every year. I was SO excited to finally commit to the Oasis on Prime Day this year. I really love everything about it...except the battery life. I charge it to 100% and it lasts less than 24 hours. Once it gets below 30 percent, it drops about a percent per minute and it's so frustrating because all of my readers in the past have lasted weeks on one charge and could last on 15% for hours. I only read around 2-3 hours a day, give or take depending on the day, so I was disappointed in this. I air travel a lot for my job, and always loved that I could charge my Kindle and take it along with no worries of battery life, but I'll have to start packing a charger in my carry on for the Oasis.However, it's a great reader other than having to be near a charger constantly. I love the page-turning buttons (my favorite feature of the older model kindles) and the different brightness/warmth options make reading in any lighting a breeze. The touch screen is a little lag-y in my opinion, but not bad enough that I would want to remove the feature.",
Kindle Oasis ‚Äì With 7‚Äù display and page turn buttons,5.0,Love the upgrades,"Reviewed in the United States on May 15, 2021",Digital Storage Capacity: 8 GB | Offer Type: Lockscreen Ad-Supported | Color: Graphite | Option: Without Kindle Unlimited,True,"I was intimidated by the price of an Oasis and have waited years to finally purchase. I read 5-10 books a week between reading for fun and some editing and review work I do for others.The Oasis is loaded with features that I appreciate. First of all, I don‚Äôt like cluttered interfaces (which is how the Kindle Fire I borrowed was for me). I simply didn‚Äôt need my Kindle to be anything but a portable library. The Oasis is exactly that.Secondly, I am dyslexic. I appreciate the ability to switch to a black background and white font as well as the ability to warm the font. This has helped me increase my reading speed.In fact, the two features I love most are the back lighting as well as font stile options and size. The third best feature is the the page turn buttons. I didn‚Äôt think they would be a big deal, but I‚Äôve come to love them just as others have said in their reviews.I don‚Äôt fully understand the enormous price leap between the other Kindles and the Oasis, but due to the longevity of kindles in general, I decided to go for it.Amazon offered a generous discount for trading in older kindles. So I returned a Fire and a 3rd Gen Kindle (circa 2012) and was given a $25 credit plus 20% off a new Kindle purchase. When all was said and done I bought a new Oasis for less than the refurbished one I had been contemplating.I read a lot. For me it‚Äôs been worth it. If you read but don‚Äôt really need the lighting options and don‚Äôt mind the page turning, then I‚Äôm not sure the Oasis will be as much of a gain for you.Also... it‚Äôs tough to go back. I doubt I‚Äôll ever be happy with anything less than an Oasis now üòÇ. So keep that in mind.Oh and the battery life is better than the Fire but not as great as my old kindle e-reader. I keep WiFi and Bluetooth off but still have to charge every couple days (probably due to light settings... also there‚Äôs a setting you can shut off that conserves that when on allows metrics to be sent to Amazon‚Äî- pass). I don‚Äôt travel or need battery to be better, but I do miss the once a month charge the e-reader needed.",
Kindle Oasis ‚Äì With 7‚Äù display and page turn buttons,5.0,Worth it,"Reviewed in the United States on September 10, 2021",Digital Storage Capacity: 8 GB | Offer Type: Lockscreen Ad-Supported | Color: Graphite | Option: Without Kindle Unlimited,True,"I have had Kindles since version 1 (whose quirkiness and feel in the hand I adored) with my latest ‚Äîand first experience with lights‚Äîbeing the Voyage.  I liked the portability of the Voyage, with it being so small, but found the screen a little too small as I grow long sighted, and the form factor hard to hold, since there isn‚Äôt much edge.I was tempted by the Oasis because of its asymmetry: I could imagine holding it in one hand. I also liked the idea of having a larger, sharper screen.I held off because of reviews about the cold aluminum shell and the supposedly terrible battery life.However, I took the plunge and have been delighted. The battery life is absolutely fine (better than the Voyage). Admittedly I‚Äôm not using it for hours and hours every day, but I go through reading jags and so far have gone at least 2 weeks between charges, and I have the light and WiFi on all the time.I love the buttons on the side (I found it off at first that the top button is the ‚Äúforward button, but it works when holding in one hand, and if you still don‚Äôt like it you can change it in the settings.The screen is a good size and the best quality I‚Äôve seen yet. Page refresh is good and the touxhscreen response is so fast I can actually use it now (sorry, Voyage, but your response time was rubbish)I also like that the screen flips automatically, meaning if I want to hold the kindle in either hand, by the fatter part, it adjusts for me.The latest update seems to have restored the OS to a more intuitive former interface, thank goodness (not a comment on this hardware except to say it works great on the wider screen).I bought a Fintie origami case to go with it (that‚Äôs a quibble: the cheaper Voyage came with the origami case. Seems a bit cheap not to include a case with such an expensive device!). I end up leaving the cover flapping when I‚Äôm not using it as a stand, so I can hold the kindle by it‚Äôs fatter battery area,  and that‚Äôs comfortable enough.Very happy with this and glad I took the leap.",One person found this helpful
Kindle Oasis ‚Äì With 7‚Äù display and page turn buttons,4.0,Replaced my B&N Nook w/ this,"Reviewed in the United States on August 17, 2020",Digital Storage Capacity: 8 GB | Offer Type: Lockscreen Ad-Supported | Color: Graphite | Option: Without Kindle Unlimited,True,"I'm going to be frank - this purchase was a revenge buy because Barnes & Noble pissed me off lol. I've been an avid Nook owner since its release 11 years ago. I had owned 5 different Nooks, and honestly loved all of them up until recently. There is a known issue that randomly affects people preventing the device from recognizing ebook files from other sources (such as checking books out through library online resources).That preamble being done, I switched to the Kindle because this finally impacted me on the nearly brand new Nook Glowlight 3 that I purchased.I ultimately chose the Kindle Oasis because it was most comparable to the Nook Glowlight 3 feature-wise. They're similar in size, and both offer the Warm Light function. This is really my main complaint when comparing the devices. The Glowlight 3 is the more affordable Nook options and includes the Warm Light, but the Oasis is the most expensive model of Kindle at almost double the cost to provide basically the same device. It wouldn't be as hard of a pill to swallow if it was as effective as the Nook, but it isn't. The Warm Light really isn't very warm at all. And if you set the device to switch to warm light based on your time zone sunrise/sunset, it simply never changes. Less than cool.One thing I do appreciate in comparison to the Nook though, is that the finish is not rubberized. This might make the Nook comfortable to hold, but it definitely made it significantly more challenging to keep clean. This Kindle is easy to wipe any finger smudges off.The connectivity with Goodreads is also really neat. I use Goodreads pretty avidly and like that it's accessible from the same place my books are now.I don't particularly care for the screen orientation being able to flip, but I can see practical purposes for it such as if you want to use the page turn buttons but need to switch hands you're holding the Kindle in so I can't hold a grudge about this.All in all, this is a solid e-reader. I do maintain that it is substantially overpriced compared its primary competitor with comparable functions, though when you're being spiteful and purchasing it when seeing red that doesn't quite matter I suppose lol.*I did select the option to set-up my Amazon account to the device which did not happen. Delivery time was almost a week, which I assumed was due to this selection but never actually happened. It's easy to set up on your own so don't bother selecting this option since Amazon won't bother to do it anyway.*",
Kindle Oasis ‚Äì With 7‚Äù display and page turn buttons,4.0,Not as great an upgrade on Paperwhite as I thought,"Reviewed in the United States on December 26, 2019",Digital Storage Capacity: 8 GB | Offer Type: Lockscreen Ad-Supported | Color: Graphite | Option: Without Kindle Unlimited,True,"I've had the kindle oasis for over two months. I've read a few thousand pages on it by now. I'm going to compare it to my OLD Kindle Paperwhite (not sure what version, but not one with a flush screen.)Overall, I'm not totally psyched. I'm going to go ""point by point"" on the ""Compare Kindles"" page at Amazon. I'll omit the ones that are pretty obvious or a wash, like 300 dpi on both, or storage.1) Price. I got mine for like $175. I'm very glad I didn't pay $250 for it.2) 7"" vs 6"" screen. Not a big improvement. Perhaps even a downgrade since I can't fit it in my pocket. That also has to do with the design.3) Front light : I think the 25 LEDS actually DO provide a smoother appearance, less shadowing, especially when dimmed.4) Weeks of battery life : this is what bothers me. Yesterday, I charged to 96%. I had the opportunity to read for a few hours, and had it set pretty bright. By bedtime I was at 65%. And I'm going away for a few days, so I had to recharge to 100%. Battery life is NOTICEABLY worse on this thing.5) Flush front : I really like this. The new PW has it so that's a wash. This is a nicer look and feel than the old PW.6) Warmlight : this is window dressing. If Amazon just set it at one ""warmth"" and left it, it's not a feature I'd ever think about. Not a benefit.7) Auto-adjust : this is actually an annoying feature. It's so sensitive that it will change brightness as I shift around in my chair. This WOULD be nice if it wasn't so sensitive. Keep it the same when you're within a certain tolerance. Change it when I move from the sunny living room to the dark bed room, then leave it there. You don't need to change every time a cloud passes in front of the sun.8) Ergonomic design. No. It's not a ""handle"", but the worst thing is that it's so slippery. That matte surface of the PW provides a much better ergonomic experience. This was my first kindle where I had to use a finger-strap to aid with holding, and that brings the weight back to the weight of the PW.9) Auto rotate : this was a must because of the asymmetry of the device  and works very well, accurately and quickly without being too sensitive.10) Page turn buttons. I like these. I use them primarily. Having buttons and page-touch gives you more flexibility of holding the device.Overall, I would say I give it a SLIGHT nod over the PW but not at the price point.Put the 25 LED's in the PW and I give the PW the nod.",
Kindle Oasis ‚Äì With 7‚Äù display and page turn buttons,4.0,Connection issues *updated*,"Reviewed in the United States on December 29, 2020",Digital Storage Capacity: 32 GB | Offer Type: Lockscreen Ad-Supported | Color: Champagne Gold | Option: Without Kindle Unlimited,True,"Update: 1-4-2021: The new Kindle is staying connected, which is wonderful. I love how it looks it feels and it's so much more lighter then Kindle Fire. What I'm not a fan of as shown in my picture though is I went through and I downloaded all my books and only like a fourth of the covers downloaded with it. I have over 2,000 books so that was disheartening. What I found out afterwards though is the ones that did not download the cover is that if I take my time and undownload them and re-download them it will load with it,  but I've had to reboot several times during the process and it's taken me about three days to do this successfully. Another thing I'm not a fan of is that any MOBI files don't show the cover but yet on my Kindle Fire it did show the cover that's kind of a bummer for me. Overall I do like the candle so I'll probably end up keeping it but those are a couple of my takeaways. I don't mind the plug the charging cord that it's not like other things and I don't mind that I can't put in a micro SD card.Old review"" I really love the feel of it and I even got to play around with the light a little bit so I love how that looks. I get it's black and white; I really prefer color but I still want to give this a try. The reason I gave it a 2-star is because of the above but also it won't stay connected to the internet and I rebooted my router and everything else around my house is fine but this Kindle. Not only that, once it does connect to the internet and I go to register my device, it kicks me right off and it won't get back on. I had to hard restart it to get it to reconnect to the internet . I've done this at least 5 times if not more  and I can't get it registered properly. I get the message in the picture above. I did call Amazon and I am going to return it. I'm going to try to order a new one and see if that does work. I do see other reviews where other people have had this problem and once they got a new one it, it was fine. I really hope that's the case so I can change this review otherwise this will stay the same.",

Kindle Oasis ‚Äì With 7‚Äù display and page turn buttons,5.0,Love it...  but...,"Reviewed in the United States üá∫üá∏ on December 27, 2020",Digital Storage Capacity: 32 GB | Offer Type: Lockscreen Ad-Supported | Color: Champagne Gold | Option: Without Kindle Unlimited,True,"I love the Kindle Oasis.  The larger hard drive size, the lighting options, etc.  If you don't already have a kindle with adjustable lighting, you definitely need one.  I LOVE my kindle.  Having said that, here are the potential downsides for you to own this.  Decide for yourself if these are dealbreakers for you.  They are NOT dealbreakers for me.  I would repurchase the Oasis if I needed to.Potential Downside #1:  The battery life isn't nearly as good as the Kindle Voyager that I had prior to this.  Voyager lasted me almost a full month.  Oasis lasts me about two weeks.  Obviously, how long it lasts you depends on how much you read, how often it needs to search for usable wifi access, and how much you use the variable lighting.Potential Downside #2:  This one is the real annoyance for me.  The buttons to move the pages forward/backwards are only on side of the kindle.  Which is fine.  However, the touchscreen only allows forward on the right side of the screen and backwards on the left side of the screen.  But if you're holding the kindle with the buttons on the right of the kindle, there's no way to turn the page forward if you're holding the kindle with your left hand.  You can only turn the pages back with your left hand.  so you need to flip the kindle upside down with the buttons on the right of the kindle in order to be able to move forward with both hands.  It's a minor thing but an annoyance nonetheless.  The only way around this is to hold the kindle upside down.  Which is fine because the orientation will automatically flip your book around so you can read it right-side-up.  But it's a dumb thing that annoys the heck out of me.  :)Potential Downside #3:  They still haven't fixed the annoyance of not being able to easily sort/categorize your books.  They need to provide an easier way to create folders and sort your books into them without having to do them one by one, manually.  But this downside is the same across for ALL of the Kindles.  I'd hoped they'd improved the Oasis to allow for this but alas, no.Decide for yourself if any of these downsides are enough for you to say no.  Not me!  I love my Oasis.  But I try to be honest so that you can decide for yourself.",One person found this helpful
Kindle Oasis ‚Äì With 7‚Äù display and page turn buttons,4.0,Has it‚Äôs ups and downs,"Reviewed in the United States üá∫üá∏ on June 23, 2021",Digital Storage Capacity: 32 GB | Offer Type: Lockscreen Ad-Supported | Color: Champagne Gold | Option: Without Kindle Unlimited,True,"I got my Kindle Oasis in April and while I really like it, I wouldn‚Äôt say it‚Äôs perfect by any means (though it is my favorite out of all of my ereaders I‚Äôve owned).I like the lighting options, and how thin it is which makes it great for travel. My boyfriend and I went on a small trip and at the end of the night encountered stop and go traffic. I was able to easily read my book without any eye strain and without lighting up the whole car. It fit perfectly in my mini-backpack that I had brought and stuffed full of junk.I did purchase a case for it. It‚Äôs not that I‚Äôve overly worried about damaging it (especially at home), but I wanted to make sure it‚Äôs safer on trips because it still feels very fragile in a way other ereaders don‚Äôt.I‚Äôll be honest, I don‚Äôt really have an opinion on the shop interface, as I usually just buy books from the website and have them ‚Äúdelivered‚Äù to my kindle. This feature works well for me, because I like being able to flip quickly between books and I know from experience that its different with ereaders.Personally I haven‚Äôt had any issues with the battery. I generally leave it in Airplane mode and the battery lasts for quite a while that way (I take it out of Airplane mode when I buy books). The battery lasts longer than the kindle fire 7 and nook tablets that I used to own. I can‚Äôt remember how long my old nook ereader‚Äôs battery used to last, but I‚Äôm not disappointed in this battery like so many people seem to be. I feel like everyone is expecting it to last forever, when given the design and setup it makes sense that it would guzzle the battery more than some other options. The extra lighting options alone will eat up more battery than a traditional e-ink reader by nature.I guess the biggest question is if it‚Äôs worth the money. For me the answer is yes. It‚Äôs lightweight, comfortable to hold, and I love the lighting options. The e-ink screen helps prevent eye strain that you‚Äôd get with led screens and is more book-like. It‚Äôs compact and has plenty of storage space with cloud options. Any downsides for me are negated by the upsides. I‚Äôve found that I read more with this kindle than any other reader, which as a former book-nerd has been really great.",

The extra inch makes a huge difference for reading pleasure, and it's even more crisp and clear than the Paperwhite.-Warm light! I couldn't stand relying on the bluish frontlight of the Paperwhite while reading in a dark room. The adjustable warm light is so much better.-Vastly better performance. I found the Paperwhite frustratingly sluggish for everything but page turns, and sometimes even for those. The Oasis is quite snappy by comparison.-Premium build - it's nice to have the glass and aluminum instead of plastic.Cons:-Battery, as many people say. So far it seems to drain much more quickly, even after leaving it on the charger for a long while after setting it up and loading books, and mostly reading using airplane mode, and the other usual battery tips. We'll see how it goes in the next week or two.-The metal and glass build is nice, but seems maybe less durable than the rubbery plastic of the Paperwhite.-I miss the slim and simple form factor of the Paperwhite, which easily fits in medium-sized pockets.-Micro USB. Just because it seems everybody has to name this as a con! :-)Not sure yet:-The asymmetrical form factor. I'll have to see how it feels with a week or two of use.-The buttons. I certainly don't mind them, but we'll see if I end up actually using them.I already can hardly imagine going back to the small screen, blue light, and sluggish performance of the Paperwhite, unless the Oasis turns out to have really abysmal battery life. So far though I think I'd like the shape and size and battery of the Paperwhite but the screen, lights, and performance of the Oasis!Will update in a week or two if I have any updates.__________________TWO WEEK UPDATEI really like reading on it, but the battery life really isn't anywhere near that of the Paperwhite. In airplane mode, low brightness, reading 30-60 minutes a day - maybe 10 days of battery. No where near the advertised 6 weeks, which the Paperwhite really can do. But the better reading experience of the Oasis is worth it around home. Just any long time travel without reliable charging opportunities will require the Paperwhite.Amazon, if nothing else, please double the battery size on the new Oasis!

There are many good attributes. I love the quick refresh rate and the peppy browser compared to my previous Paperwhite and the buttons are a game changer. The screen is very responsive. I appreciate the ability to flip my Oasis upside down to switch hands for page turning, (a little more bezel on the opposite side of the buttons would have been nice to have added room to hold the unit with 2 hands and not accidentally touch the screen). Now the negative. It is stated that the Oasis will give you 6 weeks of battery life ""IF""  you read a half hour a day, turn off wifi and blue tooth (airplane mode) and keep the screen brightness at 13. Well I find this all  very unrealistic. On many days I read 1.5 - 2 hours a day, I mean let's face it it's summer, where many are sitting on the beach or buy a pool or out on a deck or porch reading for the afternoon? I don't use Bluetooth so I tried turning off Wi-Fi but what's the point of having X-ray, Wikipedia, definitions and Whispersync if you can't use them? As far as the brightness setting I keep the backlight off when outdoors and set to never more than 5-7 when indoors (13 is too bright to me) or reading in bed. Reading an average of 1-2 hours a day with backlight off or at the very low settings mentioned above I lose approximately 20% of battery life a day hence I am recharging every 5 days. This is not acceptable. If a device is going to have the many great features that the Oasis has then the battery should be powerful enough to support them with a reasonable life span of at least 2-3 weeks under REAL LIFE use. Having to constantly worry about and check the remaining charge takes away from an otherwise enjoyable reading experience. I am happy that I kept my Paperwhite so that I can continue to read while frequently charging my Oasis. So I can't  help but wonder if it was worth it for me to have spent my money on the Oasis when I am still using my Paperwhite weekely?",2 people found this helpful

It's gorgeous in every way, with perfectly even lighting, with the adjustable color temperature, with the high resolution... it's perfect, and I could read on it all day and all night.Second, the form factor with the page-turn buttons and auto-flip feature is both clever and useful. Being able to switch from left to right hand and have the buttons automatically reconfigure while the text orientation flips is clever and usable beyond words.Third, it's still as light as you want it to be, easy to hold, and has that feel of quality and workmanship we used to get from the Voyage. I use mine with a hand strap, and the location of the page-turn buttons falls naturally under my thumb.But the battery life is not what we're used to, and I think there's enough discussion of this to make it clear that it's endemic to the design. Now, it's not a big deal to remember to charge it every few days, and it gives you enough warning to finish your reading session and then plug it in. I have not found it to be in any way a deal-breaker, and for those who don't need constant network connectivity, airplane mode will considerably extend battery endurance.But sync is a critical feature for me; I read the same book on my Kindle, my iPad, and my phone throughout the day, and I may switch devices several times. This is a core function of the Kindle system, in my case, and I'm unwilling to do without it. This means I'm charging the Oasis at least weekly, because wifi noticeably drains the battery.Like I said, not a crucial failing by any means, and really the only flaw worth mentioning. But enough to deduct one star from my otherwise perfect rating. I'm still very happy with the device, and I'm happy I traded my Voyage for it.",One person found this helpful
Kindle Oasis ‚Äì With 7‚Äù display and page turn buttons,3.0,ORIENTATION LOCK AND BATTERY!,"Reviewed in the United States üá∫üá∏ on February 1, 2023",Digital Storage Capacity: 32 GB | Offer Type: Lockscreen Ad-Supported | Color: Graphite | Option: Without Kindle Unlimited,True,"I had the 10th generation paper white before. I took advantage of the trade in cause it was getting slow and I loved that the oasis had the buttons. HOWEVER, there are two major failures. First being there's no orientation lock option. There's a block option for the touch screen but nothing for the rotation. Every time I put down the kindle or I'm talking to someone while reading it would rotate the orientation. It's pretty annoying and it's an easy fix that could come with a software update. The other thing I'm not happy with is the battery life. My paper white would last WEEKS. I tried every trick I read in the reviews and while that helps I think for the price point this feature should be better. Hopefully they can get this fixed with a new oasis. In addition you would think that we wouldn‚Äôt have to pay to remove the ads being this one their premium device. Other than that it's a great device.

I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs worth $300, but it‚Äôs okay for the price I paid for it.The text isn‚Äôt QUITE as clear as the Voyage, which is a shame. And the battery life is pitiful compared to the Voyage. I love that there are buttons (which makes the Oasis more preferable to me than the Paperwhite I eventually winded up selling). It‚Äôs just weird that they‚Äôre only on one side of the screen and the back where the batter is sticks out obtrusively.The system is pretty responsive, and the yellow warm light is good. However, the warm light isn‚Äôt as intense or noticeable as that of the most recent Nook Glowlight/Glowlight Plus.Yes, I did get the 32gb version but I don‚Äôt actually see myself listening to audiobooks through Audible through my Kindle. I‚Äôll just continue listening with the Audible app through my phone.I don‚Äôt find that it‚Äôs a big deal for me that it‚Äôs not using USB-C or that it doesn‚Äôt charge on a pad like the new Paperwhite Signature.I winded up getting a third-party origami case for my Oasis that mimics what I used to have from Amazon with the origami case for the Voyage. It‚Äôs a real shame Amazon doesn‚Äôt release origami cases anymore because that‚Äôs the only way I read with Kindles now. Holding a Kindle in hand to read is for the weak.I like this Oasis 3 in an aggressively fine sort of way. I don‚Äôt love it because the Voyage will always be THE top tier Kindle for me (and it baffles me why we never saw more iterations the Voyage when it has such a huge and dedicated following and would offer a mid tier price point between the Paperwhite and the Oasis).But this is a fine device if you can find one on sale.",

Kindle Oasis ‚Äì With 7‚Äù display and page turn buttons,3.0,"Firmware Upgrade process glitches, Hard to replace bat, / overheating issues in hot temp, on 9th gen","Reviewed in the United States on July 19, 2022",Digital Storage Capacity: 32 GB | Offer Type: Lockscreen Ad-Supported | Color: Graphite | Option: Without Kindle Unlimited,True,"Had a 9th generation Kindle Oasis, and that has worked great outside of overheating in extreme temperatures.  However, after 4 years battery doesn't last more than a day.  Looked like updating battery on 9th generation is not really possible so, I ordered a new, 10th generation Oasis.  Received it and the first thing I did was update the firmware/operating system to the latest.  After that was completed and it restarted, it brought up a popup display of a tour of the New Kindle Experience.  There were supposedly 4 screens of the 'tour' to display the new features.  To get to the next screen you were supposed to press the 'Next' display on the screen.  However, doing that did nothing.  Neither did pressing the 2 hardware buttons on the right side of the Oasis.  The only other option was to press the on/off button on the top of the screen.  When I did that, it would turn off.  However, when I turned it back on, and swiped from the botton, it would go back to the 'Tour' popup display which still didn't work.  The initial tech support, even after explaining it 3 times still thought I was merely trying to register device.  Device was pre-registered so that shouldn't even had been an issue.  He transferred me to a higher level tech support, and that is about when I found a way around the problem.After turning device on and back on, instead of swiping on the bottom, there was an option to 'Learn More' in the middle of the 'off' display.  So instead of swiping at bottom, I clicked 'Learn More' and it turned the Kindle on.  For a moment it said it was completing the upgrade and then it went away and everything was ok.  Clicking on the screen worked and the other buttons worked also, so all is good, so I am hopeful things will be OK.  Downgrading rating due to initial tech service rep who was not very good, and poor firmware upgrade process.  Also taking one star away for overheating issues and hard battery replacement on 9th generation.Hope batteries can be replaced in this generation and doesn't overheat while at the pool.",
Kindle Oasis ‚Äì With 7‚Äù display and page turn buttons,4.0,Best Kindle I‚Äôve Owned,"Reviewed in the United States on December 28, 2020",Digital Storage Capacity: 8 GB | Offer Type: Lockscreen Ad-Supported | Color: Graphite | Option: Without Kindle Unlimited,True,"I‚Äôve owned several different Kindles over the years. Before purchasing this one I had a Kindle Voyage for almost five years. When I started having battery issues with it I debated for a long time on what to get to replace it. The only two choices were a new paper white or the Oasis. Both had pros and cons, so I thought, but turns out this is a great device.First of all let me address some of the complaints that led me to not think about getting this, that in the end were not a big deal. Micro USB. I get it, people want Amazon to update to USB C, but does it really matter. Let‚Äôs face it, all of our devices will never have the same charger and not a single company has all their devices using the same type of cable. Second, the battery life. I‚Äôve had this thing for probably three weeks. I charges it when I first got it and have read two books on it and am still at 45%. I‚Äôd say that‚Äôs pretty good.Moving on... The form factor is amazing. I feel like seeing this in pictures and seeing the raised page turn buttons turned me off on this as well, but believe me, it all feels right. The high end metal back that fits your grip and the buttons work. It‚Äôs definitely easier to hold than my Voyage or a Paperwhite.The screen is also amazing. My Voyage had the adaptive back light, so I‚Äôve been use to this, but the warm light is definitely better on the eyes at night. It also seems to refresh faster on page turns to the point some times I don‚Äôt even realize it has already changed the page and there is no ghosting.The power button is also located at the top, which is huge if you have ever read on a Paperwhite and turned it off mid read because the button was at the bottom.Last thing and this is more a gripe. I did purchase an Amazon cover case and did not care for it. Felt it made it more difficult to hold as when the case is open you lose the bump to hold onto. Ended up getting a sleeve for storage.",2 people found this helpful

Kindle Oasis ‚Äì With 7‚Äù display and page turn buttons,4.0,"Great reader, a few issues","Reviewed in the United States üá∫üá∏ on July 2, 2021",Digital Storage Capacity: 8 GB | Offer Type: Lockscreen Ad-Supported | Color: Graphite | Option: Without Kindle Unlimited,True,"This is an upgrade from my 2015 Kindle Voyage. I have sworn for the last two years that I was going to wait until Amazon had the good grace to release a reader with USB-C, but the Prime Day deal on this was too good for me to pass up.Overall, I'm very happy with the Oasis. I wasn't sure I'd like the form factor, but I really do. The display automatically rights itself no matter if you hold the ""handle"" in your left or right hand, and it's nice to be able to switch back and forth. The reader is very light and easy to hold. The screen is quicker to respond to taps and swipes. And the lighting and automatic light adjustment works much better than in my old Kindle. The Oasis also just has more LEDs in it, so that's nice for my aging eyes.I have three issues with the Oasis:1. Listening to audio books via Bluetooth KILLS the battery. This isn't really a surprise, and it's not a huge issue at all. I'll just listen to books on my phone when I want to listen. But if this is important to you, just be aware.  As other reviewers have pointed out, the battery life of the Oasis is worse than other Kindle models, but it has five times as many LEDs and a larger screen, so it's no shock. I'd say I'm charging it once a week or so thus far. Not a major issue for me.2. While the screen is more responsive, the Oasis takes kind of a long time to wake up when I open the cover. We're still talking about a matter of seconds, so no big deal, but I found it weird that it's slower to wake than my 6-year-old Kindle.3. No USB-C. Seriously, even considering that this Oasis model came out several years ago, it really should have USB-C. Micro-USB is irritating to deal with, and I think this is actually the only thing I own anymore that uses it. When the next version---surely with USB-C, right?---is released, I'll trade this one in on the newer one.",One person found this helpful

I can't figure out what is eating the battery.  I read for a couple hours outside in the afternoon today with the lights off and in airplane mode.  Used 25% of the battery.  Supposedly it should last for 6 weeks at 13 light level - albeit used only 30 minutes a day?  Not a reasonable benchmark.  Other features are nice - touchscreen is responsive, crisp screen.  Warm light is very nice at night.  I have just been charging it every day so I don't get left dry.  Not as promised!",
Kindle Oasis ‚Äì With 7‚Äù display and page turn buttons,5.0,"Finally, a Kindle I can use","Reviewed in the United States üá∫üá∏ on October 10, 2020",Digital Storage Capacity: 8 GB | Offer Type: Lockscreen Ad-Supported | Color: Graphite | Option: Without Kindle Unlimited,True,"I had been using an iPad mini as my Kindle device, and that had worked well for me until I began to realize that the iPad display was causing my eyes to water and feel uncomfortable. I had tried an earlier Kindle Paperwhite and the Fire HD readers, but found the Paperwhite 6"" display to be too small for extended reading and the Fire HD to give me the same eye strain that I was getting with the iPad Mini. Out of desperation I decided to trade in my Paperwhite to the new 7"" Oasis, hoping that the larger display size and the warm light settings might make it easier on my eyes. It turned out to address most of the things I disliked about my previous Kindle readers.The Oasis had several surprises for me. First, it is actually lighter than my iPad Mini, making it easier to hold with a single hand while reading. The warm light setting made a major difference in easing the strain on my eyes and I found I liked both the ability to turn off the touch screen and to use the page turn buttons. Much to my delight I found that when I turned the Oasis 180 degrees the display flipped and the function of the page turn buttons also flipped so that whichever way I held it the top button advanced the page, the bottom button flipped to the previous page and the bookmark functionality worked at the top of the screen.It isn't perfect for my use. An hour of reading caused more of a battery drop than I would have expected, touching the top of the screen to change settings or go to the Library takes longer than I would like and since there is only one power button when I flip the Oasis I have to remember that the power button is now on the bottom. Personally I would have preferred if there was an easy to access touch screen OFF button so I could turn the display off without having to use the physical button, I would have liked the option of an 8"" display and it surprises me that the charging connector is not a usb-c connector, but most of those concerns are minor for me. Overall I am very happy with the Oasis.This is the first Kindle reader that I find I can actually use and be happy with. Thanks, Amazon.",3 people found this helpful
Kindle Oasis ‚Äì With 7‚Äù display and page turn buttons,3.0,"Growing on me, but still a few points of contention, along with more info on Oasis vs Paperwhite","Reviewed in the United States üá∫üá∏ on December 12, 2019",Digital Storage Capacity: 8 GB | Offer Type: Lockscreen Ad-Supported | Color: Graphite | Option: With 3 Months Free Kindle Unlimited,True,"I have never had an e-reader before. I used to read a TON, but then I grew up and life happened, so wanted to get back in to it.I purchased both the Paperwhite and the Oasis. The Paperwhite seemed like a great device, but I could tell immediately how much more my eyes liked the larger screen on the Oasis along with the warmth feature. The warmth feature was the biggest factor for me, as it made it look much more like an actual page out of a book. I've included a picture of the Paperwhite (on the right) and Oasis (left), both set at the same brightness, but with the Oasis's warmth setting on. You can also see there is no white Kindle logo on the Oasis, which I found ever so slightly distracting on the Paperwhite. The quality of the screen on the Oasis is also much better than the Paperwhite - text is more clear and crisp. If you commute a lot or size is important to you, Paperwhite is definitely the way to go.I was really overwhelmed with the Oasis at first, just because it was so new to me. I'm pretty good with new tech, but the whole environment was slightly overwhelming because it's not just as simple as getting a new device on a platform you're already used to (ie, Windows, Android, Apple, etc). Once I got past the learning curve, I started to actually like it a bit. However, the way the Kindle sorts and handles your books could be much better. You can organize things in to 'Collections', but it still doesn't feel like enough. I recommend looking up Calibre and going from there.My biggest gripe is the ergonomics of the Oasis. Although it's not much heavier than the Paperwhite, it feels like it because of the shape of it. It just feels heavier because of the weight distribution towards the center, and is awkward to hold with that bump/excessive weight distribution that sticks out. I am a 5'9"" woman with 'normal' sized hands, so I can't even imagine how this would be for someone with smaller hands. I bought a case immediately because the shell is ridiculously slippery, and in my opinion, a horrible choice of material for something you're going to hold for hours. Looks pretty, but not very functional for an e-reader. I bought the 'Ayotu Skin Touch Feeling Case', and it is awesome. I ordered a couple of others and this one stood out among all of them big time.Last gripe is that the screen is pretty slow and laggy at times. I know it's an e-reader, but it's a very expensive one that doesn't do anything else (which to clarify I am absolutely fine with BUT, see next point), but at that price, it should really be perfect.A positive feature of this that is nice is that you can flip the device around and the screen flips with you, so if you are right or left handed or just want to switch sides during reading, that is super helpful.I do like it, but am considering whether or not I am going to keep it due to the ergonomics alone.",265 people found this helpful

I don‚Äôt want to see what time it is, what time is left in the chapter or book, progress, etc.  I just want to enjoy the stinkin book.  This kindle regularly reactivates these indicators.

It shouldn‚Äôt deactivate these whenever it feels like it.  I said ‚Äúno‚Äù!This [major] peeve aside, it‚Äôs still a good device and one very redeeming feature is the awesome inverted mode where the screen is white on black, rather than the normal version.

I've been an avid Kindle reader for over a decade now, but this newest one blows all the rest out of the water. The extra inch in screen size doesn't sound like much, but it makes a big difference in allowing you to read bigger chunks between page flips, and and the page flipping seems faster and smoother than my last Kindle (a Voyage). It makes for a better reading experience that allows you to be more engrossed in the book without too many breaks between pages. I read 95% of my books with my Kindle, and the Oasis makes it much smoother and faster to read, it's almost the page size of a small paperback. The screen is crisp, the device is nicely weighted for one-hand use, the non-reflective glass is finger-print/smudge resistant, and the touch-screen is super responsive. I thought the asymmetry of the design was going to bug me at first, but it works great to allow you to hold the device with one hand, both page-turning buttons within easy reach of my thumb, and the rest of the device's borders are very slim and non-descript. I like that it doesn't have ""Kindle"" written on the bottom like the other editions, since that sometimes stood out of the periphery of my vision.The only downer is the battery, I will agree with the consensus that it's noticeably shorter than my 2013 Voyage. Even with non-demanding settings and light use (no front light, 2-4 hours of reading a day) I noticed that it eats up at least twice as much battery as my old one. It's not TERRIBLE, you could still get around 8-10 days of reading between charges, much more than a tablet or phone, but I wouldn't recommend this one if you're going to be backpacking or camping for extended periods without electricity nearby to charge it. When you do charge it, though, it charges FAST, even though it's still a mini USB instead of the USB-3, it charges up at last 2-3% a minute by my estimations, I put it down to charge at 40% and it was fully charged in less than half an hour.Overall, a great e-reader and one that I will use on the daily for years to come!",2 people found this helpful

To me, refreshing the page with each page turn is quite obnoxious and distracting and is not a sufficient ‚Äúfix‚Äù, but is more like a duct tape workaround. That setting will remain disabled.  What‚Äôs more, unless I am mis-remembering, my Kindle Oasis 1st Generation ‚Äúpage refreshed‚Äù something like every 6 to 10 page turns even with the ‚Äúpage refresh at every page turn‚Äù disabled.  Unless I am reading a book with illustrations, my 3rd Generation Oasis doesn‚Äôt page refresh with normal page turns.Here‚Äôs an example: When I click on the top of the page to bring up the menu and click on ‚ÄúGo To‚Äù and then I go back to the book I can still see the faint grid outlines from the ‚ÄúGo To‚Äù page.  And I will see those same grid lines page turn after page turn after page turn until I leave the book I‚Äôm reading to go back to the Home Menu or access the menu within the book.  Then and only then will the page refresh and the grid lines go away. In addition, sometimes after a while under normal reading, ghost text begins to appear (words in between paragraph breaks left over from previous pages). My Kindle will page refresh only as I go in and out of books and access menu screens. It will page refresh before an illustration and after an illustration, but the majority of my books contain just plain text.Words mean things and the fact that there is a setting called ‚Äúpage refresh with every page turn‚Äù implies that my Kindle should page refresh periodically when that setting is disabled‚Äîand I swear my Kindle Oasis 1st Generation did just that.Thirteen days after I purchased my Oasis I chatted with a few Amazon representatives (the chat kept timing out and I had to be reconnected with someone else).  We reset the Kindle to factory settings and the problem didn‚Äôt go away. The final representative I chatted with set up a replacement and it arrived two days later (today). To my dismay, the replacement Kindle behaved exactly the same.I called Amazon today and asked if I could speak with an individual who knows how this Kindle is supposed to behave with regard to page refreshing‚Äîperhaps someone on the engineer team. I was told I could speak to no such person and that the best thing I could do was to write this review as Amazon reads all the reviews and can comment in them.My questions are these: First, is my Oasis 3rd generation supposed to be page refreshing within a plain-text book at regular intervals (every 8-10 page turns or so) even with the ‚Äúpage refresh at every page turn‚Äù setting disabled?  If so, it is not. Second, did Amazon design this Oasis to only page refresh (when ‚Äúpage refresh at every page turn‚Äù is disabled) when opening a book, closing a book, accessing a menu or stumbling across a rare (for me) illustration? If so, that is a design defect, because it is not working.  At times the screen almost looks like a page in a book that had ink transfer onto it from the opposite page.  It is frustrating to see faint lines and text as I‚Äôm reading.  It is ridiculous that I have to go out of the book and go back in or that I have to access a menu screen within the book in order for the page refresh to clear the screen of ghosting. What is doubly ridiculous is that this is occurring on Amazon‚Äôs flagship e-reader. I could understand if this was a deal on the base Kindle and that one can grow out of this problem by buying up‚Äîbut I can‚Äôt understand why this is an issue with the Oasis.  If someone from Amazon reads this, reach out to me. I‚Äôd be happy to speak with you and provide you with any additional information you need.",12 people found this helpful

Long live Oasis!Below is my original review.I have three Kindles (Fire, FireHD, and this Oasis).  I like the Oasis most of all since it does what I need it to do, allow me to read books without trying to do everything.  I have something in the neighborhood of 850 books that I've bought over the last decade and with the ""collections"" capability, I can find exactly what I'm looking for when I want it.A tap of the power button wakes up the Oasis and I'm ready to read.I see how people are concerned about the battery life, but I charge my cell phone everyday, so it's nothing to me to charge the Oasis when the power goes to about 60%.  It charges quickly, so no complaints there.I love the Oasis, and I will be reading something everyday!  You can buy it with confidence.  It's simple in design, so it won't take much to figure out how you want to set it up.  Good reading to you all!",3 people found this helpful

I have bought almost every one of the Kindle Fire tablets.  This e-book reader is my second Kindle Oasis.  My other Kindle Oasis is less than one-year-old.  I bought this the reader so that I can obtain all the latest bells and whistles.  I have no issues with the new Kindle Oasis still having micro USB ports.  I can use interchangeably the same micro USB cables and chargers that I have used accumulated over the last 17 years on the Kindle Fire tablets.  The addition of the warm light is a game-changer for me because I love to read for hours at a time and to be able to change the background light is extremely important.  I‚Äôm an older reader who is still working at a job that requires extensive reading to be successful, and the ability to use the light when I switch to pleasure reading was a great enhancement.  I also like the auto-adjusting feature for the light.  I‚Äôve always been careful about using the Kindle Oasis around war because I was afraid it would be damaged.  Now I have no problem using the Kindle Oasis anywhere that there is water.  Both my wife and I have iPads, and the Kindle Oasis beat them for having a successful reading platform.  I would not recommend buying the 8GB version, and the 32 GB version gives you plenty of room to store your books and audiobooks.  I found it easy to transfer books between the Amazon cloud and the Kindle Oasis/Kindle fire tablets.  I have found that both Kindle Oasis recharge quicker than the fire tablets.  I recommend buying the Kindle Oasis with the special offers, and one only sees the special offers when the startup the Kindle Oasis and Kindle fires.  Occasionally, you find special offers that might interest you, I have certainly found other authors that are not read.  The Kindle Oasis comes very close, in my opinion, to read a book.  When I have time for pleasure reading, I like to read books for hours.  I also like to learn about new authors.  In the Kindle system, you can find hundreds to thousands of cheap or reduced cost books and you need a new or replacement Kindle or Kindle fire.

Kindle Oasis ‚Äì With 7‚Äù display and page turn buttons,4.0,Okay not great!,"Reviewed in the United States on December 8, 2020",Digital Storage Capacity: 32 GB | Offer Type: Lockscreen Ad-Supported | Color: Champagne Gold | Option: Without Kindle Unlimited,True,"One thing I never liked about Amazon's product decisions was that ever since the Kindle DX they never went for large screen ebook readers. I use an iPad 12.9"" and an 11"" all the time and then shifting back to a 6"" kind of feels weird and makes the lack of screen real estate that much more noticeable. So when I saw this one had 7"" I decided to give it a shot.Here is my feedbackWeight: It's super light. Very easy to hold in one hand for a long time.Buttons: Placement Sucks. Most unusable button positioning. Easier to just use your finger on screen to go to the next page. No innovative thinking of how can someone go fwd and backward using just one hand.Brightness: Excellent but if you have backlight on, the battery life sucks. And barely lasts a day. If you do not use backlight then it lasts many days.Screen: Mediocrity blossoms here. 7"" and in my opinion too small. At least make it 9"" or so. The font collection also sucks pretty bad. I saw only one or two new fonts after 5 yrs. But even that was not too great. They should seriously invest in researching and adding new fonts and new display.  Oh and did I mention it also freezes?Charging: Micro-USB. Seriously dude? In 2020 you are using micro usb? Even raspberry pi uses usb-c now.  Also the cable is so short you are forced to invest in a new cable.Build: Cheap and Flimsy. Back being metal is much more slippery than it should be, specially for a reading device I am going to hold in one hand. Fairly clueless design.Overall, in the land of the blind one eyed man is the king. Since e-readers are so few, amazon is the only one worth considering. I like the kindle unlimited and used to using it for reading my sci-fi fill :) So for someone like me who like to read without the glare of ipad screen, it works. But the whole device reeks of 2005. Not exactly something that feels 2020 and costs a lot more than it should.",

Kindle Oasis ‚Äì With 7‚Äù display and page turn buttons,5.0,The current ultimate Kindle,"Reviewed in the United States on September 9, 2019",Digital Storage Capacity: 32 GB | Offer Type: Lockscreen Ad-Supported | Color: Graphite | Option: Without Kindle Unlimited,True,"I upgraded from a Paperwhite 3 to a 10 generation Oasis.  My biggest complaint about the Paperwhite is the lack of page turn buttons, which the Oasis takes care of.I purchased from Best Buy, because I was able to get a better deal than directly from Amazon.The Oasis size is interesting, at almost square.  It's a nice size to hold, and the bump under the buttons actually makes it easier.  The buttons make reading very pleasant, and you can choose which one is next page (depending on how your hold it).  You can also use the touchscreen to advance pages.  The screen is very nice, and the ability to warm up the light is very nice when reading in the dark.  I like the fact that it detects the orientation, and allows you to hold the buttons in your left or right hand, orienting the page automatically.My only complaint is that it takes a couple of seconds to wake up.  Definitely longer than my old Paperwhite.Now that the Paperwhite is also water resistant, this Kindle has three benefits - more lights and the ability to warm up with light color.  And page turn buttons.  You'll have to decide if that is worth almost twice as much to you.Then there is the big question, is a Kindle right for you?  Reading on an e-ink screen is vastly superior to reading on a normal tablet (like a Fire or iPad).  It is much easier on the eyes, in a well lit room, or in the dark.  The screens are fast now, so page turns aren't the problem they originally were.  If you read prose, a Kindle is a great device.  They fall down with books that have a lot of unique formatting (tables, images, call-outs, etc.)  For these kinds of books, a larger screen iPad is superior.  The Kindle ecosystem is also fantastic.  Buying from Amazon is easy, there is a huge selection, and you can often find good deals.  Prime members can borrow a number of books for free and the Kindle unlimited subscription has even more (but you need to read at least one book a month to make it worthwhile).  Our local library also allows you to check out Kindle books from them.  Its kind of a pain to get books from other stores into a readable format for the Kindle, but it is possible for the technically minded.  Highly recommended.",4 people found this helpful
Kindle Oasis ‚Äì With 7‚Äù display and page turn buttons,3.0,Not Enough Difference from Current Paperwhite to Justify Cost,"Reviewed in the United States on February 24, 2022",Digital Storage Capacity: 8 GB | Offer Type: Lockscreen Ad-Supported | Color: Graphite | Option: Without Kindle Unlimited,True,"I have purchased nearly every version of the Kindle e-reader since I bought a first-generation Kindle in 2008. Each new version has been enough of an upgrade to justify buying a new one. I finally broke down and bought a Kindle Oasis when they went on sale in November 2021. After using it for three months I just do not see enough improvements to justify the much higher price over the current version of the Paperwhite (11th Generation) and in several ways I still prefer my Paperwhite. The differences in display size (7"" vs 6.8"") and front light (25 LEDs vs 17 LEDs) are negligible. Both have a screen resolution of 300 ppi, both are water resistant (handy if you want to read in the tub or by a pool), both seem to have the same battery life, both have an adjustable warm light option, and both come with 8GB of storage (enough for thousands of e-books). You can pay extra for 32GB of storage on either the Oasis or the Paperwhite, but I cannot imagine ever wanting or needing to store 10,000 e-books on it at one time. I have over 1,500 e-books on my Oasis and Paperwhite and have only used about half of the 8GB storage. (I have several thousand more e-books that I keep stored either on Amazon or on my PC using a public source library software called Calibre). Both allow you to listen to Audible books with a Bluetooth headphone, but neither will allow you to listen to audiobooks from other sources (or music). The Paperwhite has a USB-C port (and you can pay extra for wireless charging) while the Oasis still uses micro-USB. The Oasis is advertised as more ergonomic, but I find I prefer the smaller size and shape of the Paperwhite. The only significant improvement is that the Oasis has physical page-turn buttons; however, the Oasis UI interface seems to be a step down from the Paperwhite. For example, they have removed the back button from the nav bar. If you are scrolling through pages of books in your library, the home button on the Oasis does not take you back to the first page. Instead, it takes you to a homepage (designed primarily to sell you more e-books) and you can go back to your library from there. Also, the page buttons on the Oasis do not work if you are using the User Guide or doing a word search for text in books - you can only scroll through pages by swiping. The current Oasis was first released in 2019 and is past due for an upgrade. I would recommend either getting the Paperwhite or waiting until a new version of the Oasis comes out.",6 people found this helpful
Kindle Oasis ‚Äì With 7‚Äù display and page turn buttons,5.0,Bigger Screen is the Best Feature,"Reviewed in the United States on September 12, 2020",Digital Storage Capacity: 32 GB | Offer Type: Lockscreen Ad-Supported | Color: Graphite | Option: Without Kindle Unlimited,True,"A lot of what‚Äôs been written about this device seems to focus on the warmer light, which is indeed a nice addition to this model.  My wife has the generation before this one, and the difference in screen color is nice to have.  However, for me the biggest benefit by far of this model is the larger screen than my first generation Oasis, with its smaller 6‚Äù screen (same as the Paperwhite models).  One more inch of screen real estate doesn‚Äôt seem like much in the spec sheet, but it really does make a big difference in the feeling that you‚Äôre reading an actual book.  After all, how many hard-bound books are only 6‚Äù diagonally?  While also not as big as an actual book, the 7‚Äù size feels surprisingly more spacious, and also reduces the number of times you need to advance the page per hour.Another positive point of comparison vs. the previous generation is that the screen seems to be more uniformly lit in this unit.  My wife‚Äôs unit clearly shows a slight gradient across the screen from one side to the other, which is most visible in very low-lit rooms.  That gradient seems to be gone in this latest version, which is appropriate considering the rather steep price of the Oasis model compared with the Paperwhite models.  It _should_ be perfect.Coupled with the easy-to-grip Amazon fabric-covered case, this unit really does finally achieve the top-of-the-line feature set I believe Amazon was shooting for in this reader design.  One irritant for me, however, is the ads.  They are more prevalent than I expected, and I immediately paid the extra $20 to get rid of them.  Maybe it‚Äôs because I‚Äôve become accustomed to the Kindle screen saver backgrounds and a nice, clean list of books on my home screen, but I found the ads to be too invasive in those places.  The ads do not interfere with the actual reading of books, but maybe I‚Äôve just become sick of ads invading places where they really don‚Äôt belong.Bottom line: If you want an excellent reading experience, I think this model really meets that challenge.  If you have the money to spare, it‚Äôs worth the splurge.",One person found this helpful

Kindle Oasis ‚Äì With 7‚Äù display and page turn buttons,4.0,"MUCH easier on the eyes than an iPad, lightweight, easy to hold.","Reviewed in the United States on February 5, 2021",Digital Storage Capacity: 8 GB | Offer Type: Lockscreen Ad-Supported | Color: Graphite | Option: Without Kindle Unlimited,True,"I read a lot and found that the iPad which I have been using was really hurting my eyes.  I had an old Kindle which did not have a built in light (which I wanted) and decided to upgrade to the newer design and stop using my iPad for reading.I like the unit....text is sharp and clear.  Light is great.  Small, lightweight, easy to use with both the forward/back buttons (which I generally use) or screen swipe.A couple of things I don't like...first, I find shopping for books on the Amazon Kindle site to be much more difficult than with the iPad.  It is hard to navigate around, scrolling is choppy and awkward.  When I want a new book, I use my computer or iPad then download it for reading on the Kindle reader.Second, viewing maps, chart, graphs, or other such supporting materials is awkward at best.  Just like my old Kindle (albeit, though the resolution is better).Last, and this is my own thing, I now find that when I am reading I have to carry around both my iPhone or iPad and the Kindle reader.  Otherwise, I am out of touch vis-√†-vis, phone calls, emails, etc.  Some people like that level of isolation when reading, I really don't.  I'm not connected with any social media platform and couldn't care less about that sort of thing.  I just don't want to be completely out of pocket.  Also...and this is a biggie for me as I tend to read a lot of historical based material...when reading, sometimes I like to look up supplemental information on a subject/location/person that may be part of the story and need the iPad/Phone to do it.Bottom line for me is that I would not have purchased the new Kindle if the iPad wasn't such a massive strain on my eyes.  Yes, there is still some eyestrain to deal with but not nearly as much.  For me, that makes it a necessity.",
Kindle Oasis ‚Äì With 7‚Äù display and page turn buttons,3.0,Kindle user since the very beginning. Oasis is a mixed bag.,"Reviewed in the United States on April 1, 2021",Digital Storage Capacity: 8 GB | Offer Type: Lockscreen Ad-Supported | Color: Graphite | Option: Without Kindle Unlimited,True,"First kindle was the very first model released. The weird, angular, white plastic one that had everyone talking. Loved it and read tons of books on it. Have used just about every Kindle family since, including oddballs like the large-format DX that I owned while I was in grad school.Currently the family shares a 4th gen Kindle Touch, a 7th Gen Paperwhite, and now an Oasis.Didn't initially get the Oasis because it's pretty pricey in comparison to the others and while I was willing to pay a premium for the lovely large DX back in the day, Oasis had a similarly small screen to to other Kindles, so... I held off. But recently got a bunch of gift cards from people so pooled them and used them to get an Oasis.Do I love it? Hrmz... Sort of.GOOD- The slightly wider screen actually does make a nice difference in readability- Love the speed of the screen refreshed, pages ""turn"" very rapidly for e-ink- Page turn buttons are back, which I absolutely love- Mild like of how lightweight it is, though it's not the sort of thing that changed my lifeBAD- Battery life is very un-Kindle-like‚Äîif you're a heavy reader, you'll charge 1-2 times *a day*- Very light + aluminum body makes it tough to hold on to, it tends to slip right through fingers- Screen contrast seems slightly lower, probably due to hard surface glare over e-ink- Fragile Micro USB instead of USB-C charging portNEUTRAL- The ""warm"" light thing does nothing for me- The ""bump"" is odd, but not in a way that really frustrates me... but it is noticeableTAKEAWAYThe big takeaway for me from the Oasis is that you trade a *ton* of battery life for a bit of extra screen. Now I know that's not a direct trade-off in engineering terms, but in terms of the user experience / buying decision, that's what it comes down to for me:- Slightly wider screen- Drastically reduced battery lifeYou can read book after book on our 4th gen Kindle without charging. I mean, weeks of on time. The 7th gen paperwhite isn't quite so robust, but if you read for an hour a night, you'll charge every week or two.The Oasis? Start at 100%, read for an hour in a dimly lit room, you're at 80%. Try to read an entire book in the same sitting and you'll push it right to ""dead battery"" and have to charge. For an e-reader, that's just not ideal, it's basically Kindle Fire (i.e. tablet / phone) battery territory.The result is that when we travel, I suspect the Oasis will be left behind because you just can't get much reading out of it compared to other e-ink readers before you have to plug in.End result: 3 stars.",4 people found this helpful
Kindle Oasis ‚Äì With 7‚Äù display and page turn buttons,4.0,"Over-priced for a B&W screen, but  may be worth the splurge if you read alot","Reviewed in the United States on February 1, 2020",Digital Storage Capacity: 8 GB | Offer Type: Lockscreen Ad-Supported | Color: Graphite | Option: Without Kindle Unlimited,True,"I admit, I am a late adopter to e-readers and Kindle. It wasn't until last month when someone offered to sell me his new Kindle Basic that I tried reading with one, preferring books until now. The new Kindle Basic was not for me. Although reasonably priced, the white light with black font hurt my eyes ( when my contacts were in), so I did not buy it from him. However, after reading the reviews on the Oasis and how it had a warm, adjustable back light, I decided to try it out since I had 30 days to return it to Amazon; so I splurged and bought it  as part of the ""cost savings bundle"" with the cover and charger.  The entire purchase with taxes was a few $ shy of $300 and that was for the 8 GB with cover and charger. I can't get over that Amazon charged $30 for the cover and also did not include the charger as part of the Oasis purchase. That's greedy.  Bottom line, I like it, though I still think the Oasis is over-priced for a black & white screen. The reasons I like it are:-the warm amber light and adjustable brightness which does not cause my eyes to feel irritated.-I can also read in bed beside my husband without turning the lamp on.-it is comfortable to hold and its water-proof (unlike the 2019 Kindle Basic)-when I travel, I only pack my Oasis and do not have to lug 2-3 bulky books with me in my bag.-what I really LOVE about the Oasis, is how easy I can borrow and download a Kindle book from the public library in only 3 clicks, without  connecting my Oasis to my laptop to sync. This is amazing! My public library has over 12K Kindle books and most of the recent best-sellers listed on GoodReads. Not to mention that as a Kindle user, I am now entitled to download 1 Kindle book a month at no charge using the Kindle Owner's Library.Because of the ease of access to the Kindle books from the Public Library and the free books from the Kindle Owner's Library (by the way, I was able to download a fairly recent best seller published in 2019), this helps justify the very pricey cost of the Kindle Oasis, as I won't purchase as many books, tapping into the Public Library system and the Kindle Library.",
Kindle Oasis ‚Äì With 7‚Äù display and page turn buttons,2.0,"Decent, not great","Reviewed in the United States on August 7, 2022",,True,"Unlike all my other kindles, this one isn't a standard shape. One side has a sort of fat handle and one side is really thin. Neither feels particularly ergonomic for holding the thing, holding by the thin side feels like too much weight is away from your hand and is tiring (physics of a lever) and the chunky handle side feels bulky and has the touch-screen further away from your fingers so its not convenient to flip pages one-handed.The 2 physical buttons the chunky side might solve this, except they are a little wobbly and can rock-back-and-forth and feel like they'll wear out far before the kindle's actual electronics wears out if I push the physical buttons, so I prefer to touch the tapscreen when possible or use a third party handheld page-turner (since amazon isn't a clever enough company to have sold a first party remote control for kindles despite it being a very obvious thing people need - and with kindles already have wifi hardware)The lopsided design (one thin side, one chunky side) also applies to how near the screen is to each edge. On the thin side, the screen is right near the edge. On the thick side, it's far away from the edge, so if I place a page-turner on the thick side using buttons to keep it up, it often wont register it actually reaching all the way to the screen. If I put it on the thin side, it is too thin and no physical buttons so slides and falls right off.I think the extra-thin side was probably designed that way so they can sell overpriced unincluded kindle covers that flip open and get taped to the back of the kindle. Unfortunately, it means the shape is awkward and inferior for someone who doesn't buy one of those covers. And adding a permanent flip-cover to a kindle would make it weigh more than the listed spec sheet, probably significantly more than my previous paperwhite.Reading and screen don't seem much changed or improved over previous ones. And the kindle menu where you try to slowly move through your collection of books is terrible, slow, cluttered and bad as an operating system as it always has been. Not very customizable (if I want to add 50 books of one series to a 50-book collection, there's no option to hide those books when just looking for books to read, I still have to scroll past all 50 of those books every time and also past the collection as well rather than them being hidden in the collection to save me time clicking the button, waiting, clicking the button, waiting, clicking the button, waiting, clicking the button, waiting...)If you don't pay extra for advertisement-removal (which makes the kindle not a great price for a very simple e-reader with bad operating system) then they'll show you tons of stuff you don't want to see. I was getting spammed with ads for sexualized adult novels the store thought were selling well, and there isn't some flip-toggle to customize ads to keep the bad ones away, which could be awkward if someone were to be trying to share a kindle with their children.It does the job of being a kindle, but amazon should be doing so much better after all these years and billions of dollars.",One person found this helpful

You'd figure that avid readers would be the ones most likely choosing this model given the price point. So why make the battery life last only a couple days? I'll read any where from 1-3 hours throughout the day/night on it and I'll at most get 2-4 days before the battery dies. My Voyage would legit last 2 weeks with the same amount of reading.",
Kindle Oasis ‚Äì With 7‚Äù display and page turn buttons,5.0,Finally a Kindle that I can keep for long term,"Reviewed in the United States on December 31, 2019",Digital Storage Capacity: 8 GB | Offer Type: Lockscreen Ad-Supported | Color: Graphite | Option: Without Kindle Unlimited,True,"I have owned a few different generations of Kindles in the past and have generally loved reading on them. I like the fact that it gives you great convenience of holding tons of books wherever you go in a very compact form factor, and the impressive battery life thanks to the e-paper technology.The last Kindle I had was a 9th generation Oasis, which was an upgrade from a Paperwhite. I was very much disappointed with the 9th generation Oasis mainly due to issues with the screen backlight. The backlight on the device had uneven light distribution on the screen - so one side of the screen (where the buttons are placed) was very brightly lit when compared to the other side. And the issue was something which cannot be ignored since it was quite evident while reading in dark when you have to completely rely on the backlight to see the text. It was a bad experience for me since I had to pay a premium price for an ebook reader. I had got it replaced twice but the issue still persisted, indicating that the design of the product itself had the issue.While I was struggling with the 9th generation Oasis, I saw that the 10th generation was out and apparently the backlight issues were no longer present in the new device. I waited for some time for the reviews to flow in to see if there were any major issues with it. And finally, I traded in my 9th generation Oasis with the 10th generation and I am so glad that I made the decision to upgrade to 10th generation.All my complaints from the previous generations are solved, and the amber lighting on the screen is amazing and I now use it almost 100% of the time. It gives you the feeling like you are reading on a real paper book. The 300 ppi resolution of the screen is very crisp for daily reading and the battery life is good enough but it could have been better. I feel that this is a Kindle that I can finally keep for a longer time to read my books and I am happy that Amazon made this small incremental update to fix an issue they had with the previous generation. I would have appreciated even more if they had acknowledged the screen issue they had but anyway, I am happy with this upgrade.",One person found this helpful

Kindle Oasis ‚Äì With 7‚Äù display and page turn buttons,4.0,"Worth the upgrade, if you don't mind the cons.","Reviewed in the United States on June 16, 2020",Digital Storage Capacity: 32 GB | Offer Type: Lockscreen Ad-Supported | Color: Champagne Gold | Option: Without Kindle Unlimited,True,"I have been a longtime Kindle user, first with the Kindle 4 back in 2011, then the Paperwhite 3 and 4. I have loved all of them. I decided to upgrade to this one recently and so far I love it.PROS:Page turn buttons--I didn't realize how much I missed these until I used the Oasis. The auto-flip is amazing as well. I lay on my side in bed, so when I turn over, I can flip the Kindle and keep reading comfortably (this was a bit less comfortable with my Paperwhite).Night light--I love this feature. I have it set to 15 from 11PM-7AM. It's much less stark, and it's not as blinding as, for example, reading on my phone. My boyfriend might get into bed after I do and it doesn't bother him at all when I use my Kindle in the dark.Front light--you can read at night, obviously. The light distribution is much better than on my Paperwhite. I can't even tell where the LEDs are.Materials--this is aluminum and glass and it FEELS way higher quality than the Paperwhite. I can tell it's a luxury item. Also, it's super light. I was amazed by the weight.CONS:Micro-USB--not a dealbreaker for me, but I do hope the next generation finally upgrades to USB-C.Battery life--It's definitely not nearly as good as my older Kindles. Unless I keep the wifi off all the time, it drains pretty quickly. I'd say it still has a week or two of battery life, which is far better than my other electronics.Awkward to hold--because of the aluminum back, it's somewhat hard to hold when not in a case. It feels slippery. I recently changed cases and I was worried when I was pulling it out of the old one that it would slip out of my hands. Some people have said it's not given them any problems, but I recommend getting a case for it.If you don't mind having to charge it more than once a month and can afford to upgrade, I highly recommend it. I think the differences between it and the lower tier Kindles make it worth it (though the Paperwhite is a great choice if you can't afford it!).",2 people found this helpful
Kindle Oasis ‚Äì With 7‚Äù display and page turn buttons,5.0,I love this thing,"Reviewed in the United States on April 1, 2021",Digital Storage Capacity: 8 GB | Offer Type: Lockscreen Ad-Supported | Color: Graphite | Option: Without Kindle Unlimited,True,"I have used various Kindles since they came out... but I haven't been one to get the latest and greatest model, until this one.  Since um, hitting middle age, I've found that an e-reader is kinder on my eyes- I can enlarge the font, and the back lit screen helps with viewing the page.  (Meaning I don't need excessive lamps, and I don't need reading glasses).  This e-reader is well balanced, and I LOVE the buttons for changing the pages.  I had the older kindle where you only could swipe to change the page... and well, I like the buttons much better. I can hold the Kindle with one hand and turn the pages with my thumb with out having to move my hand at all.  Much more convenient.  Now, I rated the battery life as mediocre.... but I would with any Kindle.  I put them to the test. I go through thousands of pages a week, so I have need to charge my Kindle daily, sometimes before the day is up, if I'm on a binge day.  But, it charges fast, so i didn't fine it a bother at all.  This e-reader is more square than any of its predecessors, which makes it a bit awkward to find a decent padded cover for it- no biggie- I made one.  I took advantage of the old Kindle trade in discount, and it made this one totally doable.  It was worth it.  I also love that I can dim the back light to more brown tones at night to block blue light, if you're into that. (And you can set it to automatically do that too).  I can read it inside and outside perfectly.  There's no going back for me.  Thousands of books at my finger tips, and no reading glasses in sight.  Yes please.

Kindle Oasis ‚Äì With 7‚Äù display and page turn buttons,5.0,Why I love this this e-reader.,"Reviewed in the United States on December 1, 2019",Digital Storage Capacity: 32 GB | Offer Type: Lockscreen Ad-Supported | Color: Champagne Gold | Option: Without Kindle Unlimited,True,"I did a lot of research on upgrading from my old 7th gen kindle. I‚Äôm a stay at home wife so I‚Äôm lucky enough to have a lot of time to read or listen to books. I can read about 5 hours or more in a day so it was important for me to love my e-reader device and this kindle oasis exceeded my expectations.First it is so light! The device is sleek and slim while also being durable. I ended up getting a pouch for traveling for it instead of a case and the pop out design on the back where the buttons are made it easier to hold than I thought but the back can be kind of slippery so you might want to consider a case.Second I LOVE the page turning buttons. My previous kindle didn‚Äôt have any buttons so flipping back a page was like pulling teeth if I didn‚Äôt hit it just right. The buttons are on the same side so it‚Äôs perfect for one handed use which I usually do so flipping back and forth is nice and easy.Third the bigger screen is the perfect size. Who knew that extra inch would make such a difference!And finally how much faster it is compared to my old one. The touch screen is much improved, no where near a tablet but MUCH improved.Few other notesI also got the 32GB because I listen to a lot of audio books and those are what takes up space. If you are just using it to mainly read you would be fine with an 8GB since books take up hardly any room. If your on the fence about size I would honestly recommend upgrading to a bigger size since it‚Äôs only $20 more.The price. It is pretty pricey. I bought it on sale for Black Friday and think it‚Äôs definitely worth the discounted price. Check on trading in your old one too if your looking to save some money.No USB-C charging. I have an iPhone so I already have to carry a charger for that so another small cord isn‚Äôt a big deal to me. I read a lot! The battery lasts more than a couple days for me and it takes maybe an hour or an hour and a half to charge. Honestly I don‚Äôt understand why everyone is so upset about it.",13 people found this helpful

Kindle Oasis ‚Äì With 7‚Äù display and page turn buttons,5.0,Love the screen orientation options and the dark mode,"Reviewed in the United States üá∫üá∏ on September 6, 2022",Digital Storage Capacity: 32 GB | Offer Type: Lockscreen Ad-Supported | Color: Champagne Gold | Option: Without Kindle Unlimited,True,"I had to give up reading paper books a few years ago due to health reasons and also, because of those health reasons what I use to read needs to be lightweight and easy to use w/dark mode. This Kindle checks all those boxes. I read for hours and I mean hours (8+ frequently) and I need an e-reader that can handle that. I love that this can be read either landscape or portrait and also can be read with a dark mode because I suffer from migraines and lighting is key to me. I gave the battery life 4 stars simply because, unless the Oasis can go weeks on a charge while handling my 8+ hours of reading multiple days in a row, then the Oasis or any e-reader will never get 5 stars from me, sorry.The Oasis is aces in my book and I would recommend it to anyone!!!",
Kindle Oasis ‚Äì With 7‚Äù display and page turn buttons,4.0,Want the best e-reader/Kindle? Look no further,"Reviewed in the United States üá∫üá∏ on August 17, 2021",Digital Storage Capacity: 8 GB | Offer Type: Lockscreen Ad-Supported | Color: Graphite | Option: Without Kindle Unlimited,True,"Originally bought the latest paperwhite. Didn't have any problems with it. Actually did like the pocketabilily of it. Just thought Id try out the Oasis and like most other reviewers, I do like it quite a bit better. Now the question is do I like it that much better over the paperwhite to justify almost double the price? Probably not. But then I didn't buy mine at 250. And neither should you!! wait for prime day sales, or I'm sure Black Friday even. But not for 250. Unless of course money is no object for you. Then yeah no need to look elsewhere just go straight for the Oasis.Ok I try summarize the differences between the two as concisely as possible. Paperwhite is half the money, more compact and good screen for reading as opposed to a tablet or phone. More than sufficient in my humble opinion. The Oasis has got a bigger footprint, less pocketable (although still very compact), has a noticeably bigger screen, and does feel faster than the paperwhite in terms of overall responsiveness. I would not let that be the deciding factor in terms of which kindle to pick. Its a e-reader, not a phone or tablet. How fast do you want it or need it to be really? Oh and going back to the screen, it is definitely nicer than the paperwhite. And has adaptive screen brightness, that quite frankly works better than any iPhone I've ever had. Also, the screen temperature can be adjusted to as warm as to your hearts content if that your jam. I would say 2 things in particular stand out on the Oasis vs the paperwhite. Its the bigger more sophisticated screen and oh can't forget, the clicky page turn buttons!! There you have it. Enjoy!!",
Kindle Oasis ‚Äì With 7‚Äù display and page turn buttons,4.0,I Am In Love,"Reviewed in the United States üá∫üá∏ on March 9, 2021",Digital Storage Capacity: 8 GB | Offer Type: Lockscreen Ad-Supported | Color: Graphite | Option: Without Kindle Unlimited,True,"I upgraded to the Kindle Oasis from the 2018 Kindle Paperwhite and I am so happy I did!First of all, the Kindle Oasis is for avid e-book readers. If you spend most of your reading time using an e-book device, this is the best and most comfortable option IMO. I spend a few hours - daily - reading from my Kindle so the warm light addition is wonderful for my eyes. Also, I have always preferred having physical page-turn buttons to using the touchscreen. Also, ergonomically, this is a comfortable Kindle to hold. I use a sleeve as a case, so when I am reading there is no case or added weight to the Kindle and it is very comfortable one-handed. I did buy an Amazon case for the Oasis but found it disrupted all the ergonomic features I wanted to utilize. So I will keep that case for whenever I travel or spend extended time outside.The downsides of this device are . . .NO USB C - arg! I really hope this changes SOON PLEASE!!!Battery Life is not as good as other Kindle devices. I want to add that it is not terrible battery life, but it is not great by any means. I utilize the warm light and the back light and as I said previously, I spend hours every day reading on my Kindle Oasis and the batter drains FAST. This isn't a prohibitive problem for me since I am always capable of charging when needed, but I did notice I needed to charge my Oasis more often then I ever needed to charge my Paperwhite.If you are a casual e-book reader, Kindle Paperwhite or whatever tablet you own will be suitable for you. The cost of the Kindle Oasis is much higher than any other Kindle option so that is why I say this is a device for folks that PRIMARILY read e-books. Hope that helps folks!",2 people found this helpful
Kindle Oasis ‚Äì With 7‚Äù display and page turn buttons,4.0,"Love the Kindle Oasis, but the Paperwhite is still OK.","Reviewed in the United States üá∫üá∏ on January 7, 2020",Digital Storage Capacity: 32 GB | Offer Type: Lockscreen Ad-Supported | Color: Graphite | Option: Without Kindle Unlimited,True,"I have been a long-time Kindle Paperwhite user.  I hesitated to upgrade to the Oasis, primarily because of the cost.  Over the holidays, I found a deal on the Oasis that I couldn't refuse.  I got the 32GB Oasis for ~$199. (Reg. Price $249). I find that the new Oasis is just as agile and easy to use as the Kindle Paperwhite.  But, I LOVE the page buttons.  It makes the shape of the Oasis a little different, but I love the ability to move pages with the buttons rather than a screen touch.  It makes it much easier to read in bed (where I do most of my reading.)  I can hold it in one hand and use the buttons, where I had difficulty using one hand with the Paperwhite.  I still get the the paper ink screen that I love, plus it is soooo much faster I can't even express.  I like the new speed.  There are many other new features that I haven't even begun to explore; I am just enjoying the speed and the page buttons.  The ONLY thing I don't like is the cost of the covers.  I bought a cheaper cover and it is working ok, but, the ""official"" covers for the Oasis are ridiculously priced.  You can't really have the reader without a cover and if you want an ""approved"" cover it's another ~$50.  That's nuts.  I got one I like for ~$20, but, it doesn't have auto-sense to shut off/power on when you open and close the cover.  It's ok because the battery life of the Oasis is much better than the Paperwhite, but I wish the more popular ""approved"" cover were a bit more affordable.  My Summary; if I didn't find the item on sale and have a gift card, I am not sure I would have spent the $200 to upgrade my paperwhite to the Oasis.  The paperwhite is sufficient for eReading and functions well.  However, the speed, battery life, and page button improvements with the Oasis are awesome ""luxury"" upgrades.  If you have the $$, and you read a lot (as I do), it's worth the cost.  If you are on a budget, the paperwhite is still extremely relevant and will get the job done.",2 people found this helpful
Kindle Oasis ‚Äì With 7‚Äù display and page turn buttons,5.0,Near Perfect,"Reviewed in the United States üá∫üá∏ on January 27, 2021",Digital Storage Capacity: 8 GB | Offer Type: Lockscreen Ad-Supported | Color: Graphite | Option: Without Kindle Unlimited,True,"Pros:1. It's very comfortable to hold. Lighter than the Paperwhite and MUCH lighter than the Kindle Fire HD8 I've been using.2. One handed reading with either hand! Switches effortlessly from left to right hand reading. When reading with my right hand, I tend to use the touch screen for page changes. When reading with my left hand, I use the buttons for page changes. (flipping it upside down re-orients the text to be clear)3. Warm light is wonderful and the method of the ""adjustable"" light setting is crazy good. You set it how you like it, how bright, how warm, then check the adjustable box. It will maintain that same relative brightness. So if you generally like it brighter, it will be brighter; if you like your screen less bright, it will still get brighter when needed, but not as much.4. Audio books! I was reading Footfall, and I also have the audio book for that. When I was cooking, I could just switch to the audio book seamlessly and play it on a bluetooth speaker in the kitchen--faboo! To switch back I just picked it up and switched back to reading . . . and it started where the audio left off, so cool.5. Bigger screen, even though the device itself is actually smaller than the paperwhite vertically (though about 3/4"" wider) the screen is significantly larger (just less black space around the edges). It's nice, very nice.Cons:1. I sewed pockets on my aprons that are wide enough to easily fit the Paperwhite. Some of them aren't big enough for the Oasis. Obviously fixable, but annoying at present.2. No headphone jack. So I have to use a bluetooth receiver for my favorite headphones.3. Same stupid micro USB charging/data port. USB-C would be so much better.Notes: It's supposed to be water resistant, so that's a little less worry, but I'm still not going to get into the bathtub with it.",One person found this helpful

I placed it lovely on my nightstand. Life was great!That night, my wife and I celebrated our wedding anniversary #11. The meal I picked up from our local restaurant was lovely, the company was lovely. Except that my wife seemed a little nervous. After a few glasses of wine, and after we finished our last bite of dessert, she couldn't wait any longer.She revealed that our puppy had used my Kindle as a chew toy.While my wife was taking a shower, and while I was picking up our meal, the puppy was in our bedroom. Bored. So bored, that instead of chewing the numerous chew toys we had spread out across the bedroom floor, he had decided to look elsewhere for something to chew. And he found it on my nightstand. My beautiful newly covered Oasis.Needless to say, this put a damper on my happiness that evening. Yet again, it made me curse the puppy's name.So please learn from my mistakes. Nothing in the documentation, or the Amazon web page, mentions that the Oasis is NOT PUPPY PROOF. It cannot withstand the pressure of a 8 month old puppy jaw.  It does not emit puppy repellant.

I have used it a lot and it really does reduce eye strain. When I read with my Kindle Fire after awhile my eyes would burn & eventually I couldn't even focus. Reading with the Oasis does not cause any eye strain for me at all. I can see it perfectly in sunlight & in a dark room. It is also light and easier to hold since it is more of a square than a rectangle. You can hold it easily in one hand. Also, the space on the side (where the page buttons are) gives you room so you don't accidentally change the page. With the Kindle Fire, I was accidentally changing the page when I put my thumb down. It's so light in comparison it doesn't hurt my wrist either. And if you fall asleep while reading you won't hurt yourself when it falls on you lol. There are a few things, however, that the Fire has that the Oasis does not. The Oasis does not have the page scroll feature. It also does not have the flip page like a book feature, which would be nice since the screen gives you the look of a real book page. The oasis is also black & white so the book covers are not in color....so blah. I also noticed that while the Oasis has the page numbers at the bottom along with the percentage of book read, it doesn't have the total pages in the book. Fire has a better page set up, easier to see books in your library, easier to shop for new books, easier to see your lists (so I'll continue to use my Fire for that). You would think the Oasis would have all the features of the Fire and more considering the price. I am still happy with the Oasis because the biggest selling point for me was the fact that it would be easier on my eyes and it absolutely is. Just get it on sale!",

I then bought the Kindle Oasis ONLY because of the page turn buttons.  I like it just fine, but I think it is far too expensive for just the page turn buttons.  I like it for the most part, but there are a few issues I have with it.  I wish it had more of a ""lip"" or ""neutral space around the reading area.  If you hold it anywhere but the wide strip with the buttons the touch screen stuff comes up, which is a pain.  I also actually wish it was a tad thicker.  I have arthritis in my fingers, so it being so thin hurts my hands if I read for very long.  I do, however, love the lighting.  I do have trouble finding things on the home page.  I use my Kindle Unlimited and find it hard to switch back and forth between that and my purchased books and collections.  I still am not sure if I am supposed to turn the WIFI off like I did on my old Kindle Keyboard and have not found direction on how to do this.  I am not certain about battery life.  I have had it for about a month and have had to charge it once.  I do read every day, usually for at least 1 hour - more on the weekends.  I do read in bed and I like to lay on my side.  This Kindle is very light, so this is very easy to do.  I also like that I can turn it upside down in order to get the page turn buttons on the opposite hand.  The one thing I would complain about - STRONGLY - is that at a price tag of $249, it really is a slap in the fact having to pay $20 for the converter to plug into the wall.",
Kindle Oasis ‚Äì With 7‚Äù display and page turn buttons,4.0,Spend the money and purchase the Oasis,"Reviewed in the United States üá∫üá∏ on October 8, 2019",,True,"Way to go Amazon! Put an ugly bright Amazon logo on the cheaper model so I purchase a more expensive one! All that aside, I'm very happy I chose the Oasis. By far the best Kindle yet. I get very attached to my kindles and have a hard time choosing when I need a new one. When my kindle keyboard broke I purchased the Voyage and absolutely loved it. I was so disappointed when I broke it last week and found Amazon no longer makes them. So the decision began.....I prefer buttons but wanted them on both sides, and I wanted waterproof.  I didn't care for the design of the oasis (I didn't want to have to flip it every time I change hands) but I did like the fact it had some buttons and the warm lighting I felt was something I would use. But the price!!!! I considered the paperwhite but there was no way I was going to look at the logo all the time. I would have bought the basic (with a black unobtrusive logo) but it wasn't waterproof. So....that left 1 option...Here are my list of pros and cons:Pros are buttons, no branding on the front screen, waterproof, warm lighting, easy to hold, the screen is beautiful and easy to immerse yourself in reading.Cons are battery life, buttons are a bit noisy (make a clicking sound that might annoy your parter at night), metal casing is horrible to hold naked which ties in with the next con. If your going to make an odd shaped device then make a cover for it that doesn't obstruct holding it like it's designed to be held! Come on Amazon, something as simple as a case and you can't get that done in 2 years? This forces you to buy 2 cases if you want to hold it comfortably. Also the screensavers are the ugliest things I've ever seen! I purchased the one without ads so I could get it sooner and if I would have known how ugly the screensavers looked I would have waited. Why can't you just put the picture of the boy under the tree?All said, I do believe that this is the best kindle yet. With the 25% trade in that Amazon is offering right now and the 3 months of kindle unlimited, that brought the price down to just above the regular price of the paperwhite. I recommend going with the one with ads which look better than the screensavers. If you can afford it, it is definitely the best kindle ever made.",84 people found this helpful

Kindle Oasis ‚Äì With 7‚Äù display and page turn buttons,5.0,Obsessed,"Reviewed in the United States üá∫üá∏ on August 5, 2019",Digital Storage Capacity: 8 GB | Offer Type: Lockscreen Ad-Supported | Color: Graphite | Option: Without Kindle Unlimited,True,"I started my kindle journey 4 years ago after much personal resistance due to my love of paper... I started with the paperwhite. It wasnt a flush screen, but the quality of the device, the texture of the screen, I was sold. No more 500 page books in my purse, just one tiny device with a hundred or so books on it. After a year or so with my first paperwhite, I thought it would be awesome if there were buttons, so I could read with either hand. I looked into a Voyage and bought a refurbished one... the buttons were a game changer. I could use either hand to go back and forth.Fast forward to the all-new Oasis. The buttons were a huge perk for me, the screen size was also another selling point, but the warm light was what sealed the deal. I am legally blind (thus the larger screen) I can see fine with glasses but I love to read in the dark, on my side in my bed - glasses get in the way... so the screen size is so awesome. I also suffer from chronic migraines, so I use a blue-light filter on my phone at all times, and I always kept my previous kindles on very dim light because it was just so blue. Queue the warm-light screen - I'm sold. Easier on my eyes, my migraines, and the ability to use the buttons (and customize which button goes forward vs. backward), I am literally obsessed. I don't leave it at home, ever. I don't even typically leave a room without it.If you're debating it, take the plunge. It is SO SO worth the money.Of course there are a TON of other perks - being water proof, having audible and bluetooth connection is incredible.I also traded in my two previous kindles for a total of $75 credit, plus an additional 25% off for doing so. They give you enough time to send in your old devices so you can make sure you are satisfied with the new one - and I'm not exaggerating when I tell you I took it out of the box and was hooked before it even came on all the way.Amazon knocked it out of the park - the ebook game has changed and they have won it.

I missed from my Paperwhite both, hard key to change pages as well audio book compatibility. This new Kindle Oasis brings back a such features I missed in Paperwhite. I really loved the best ergonomics as it is easier to read it with a single hand. A slightly bigger screen, much more memory for my stuff and ""night mode"" with yellow accent light completes the increased features.As the new ergonomics is one of the main reasons for my upgrade, it means offered covers are useless for me as they will kill the way you will grip the reader. If using a cover, the reader will lost much from its convenience to handle it with a single hand.Amazon went to more aggressive approaching in their market efforts offering the same devices at same street prices from the US in countries like Brazil, where I purchased it, despite their higher costs and taxes, to offer the device at there.On the other hand, it continues to be very slow to react to touch and even to a simple turn on and off - I cannot understand why as the processing power embedded into it is bigger than all we had to send man to moon by probably more than ten times. My mobile running Kindle is way faster and responsive. Probably part of the reason is the slow reaction time from paper ink screens but the summary is it is a nuisance for me sometimes.Two remaining limitations since the very beginning IMO is it is limited to B&W - it is almost useless for magazine or books where color in part of the contents. Another limitation is the file format that limits formatting. Usually if your book incudes pictures or illustrations it will appear cumbersome most of the times. I really did not get why Amazon did not perfect their format to handle images a little bit clever since it was released eons ago.Bottom line is it is a good eBook reader but I am something unsatisfied with some of its features.

Kindle Oasis ‚Äì With 7‚Äù display and page turn buttons,5.0,Kindle vs the iPad debate,"Reviewed in the United States on December 14, 2019",Digital Storage Capacity: 8 GB | Offer Type: Lockscreen Ad-Supported | Color: Graphite | Option: Without Kindle Unlimited,True,"My first kindle and let me tell you, the first time I laid hands on the kindle Oasis at Best-Buy, I wanted to throw it at the wall.  A floor associate came asking if he could help.  Yeah! Convince me to buy this $250ish device that feels like Atari 2600 and only does one function.  It just felt clunky, slow and made me frustrated with the unfamiliar interface.  Though, it immediately had one thing going for it - it was light and balanced extremely well in my hands like a good chef's knife.  Yet, I couldn't bring myself to spending the amount of dough Amazon wanted for the device.Having used iPads since their first generation it was a hard sell - a black and white device that is much smaller, slower and only did one thing, whereas iPad could do that and much more.  Fast forward a week or two and realizing that I haven't touched the iPad in months to read on it, my thoughts would constantly find its way back thinking about kindle.  This is when I began my research and finally, (thinking that if I don't like it, I can return it) bought the Oasis.It's simple folks, if you read, kindle is the way to go.  I was in the iPad camp until I was kindled with the experience of a kindle, there is just no comparison.  It is easy to read, absolute pleasure to hold and though it only does a limited set of functions (comparatively speaking), it does it astonishingly well.I still think it's overpriced and the battery is not as supped up as  it is believed to be, though it could be the time I spend with my kindle tweaking it and playing with it as well as countless hours spent enjoying a good read.  I know for me, there is no going back to the iPad for reading and the back-end support for books is unbelievable.  Don't forget, Amazon started as a digital bookstore, so they know what they're doing and it shows.  Could kindle be better?  Sure. At the moment, however, it is my oasis in the world of books.",One person found this helpful

I LOVE my Paperwhite but decided to go with this one due to the larger screen, lighting, and the page turn buttons. I received this yesterday and so far I really enjoy it, but I‚Äôm not sure yet if I‚Äôll return it for an upgraded Paperwhite.Reasons I didn‚Äôt give 5 stars:I‚Äôm not a huge fan of the materials used to make it. I feel like it would really suck for reading outside in a hot day. I will probably end up getting a cover to alleviate this if I decide to keep it. A lot of people complained about the micro USB charging but that doesn‚Äôt really bother me too much as this is what my previous Kindle took for charging as well. However, it would be more convenient to have a USB-C charger, like everything else used, simply due to the battery of this Kindle. Having to carry around multiple chargers is kind of annoying and only so because this Kindles battery life is less than optimal. It‚Äôs advertised as having a 6 week battery life, I just don‚Äôt see how that‚Äôs possible. I received this with 50% battery and after very minimal use it dropped to 38% in just a 3 hours. (Read just a few chapters and then was on sleep mode for the rest of the evening). My Paperwhite has been on the same battery percentage for a day and a half, after reading for several hours. The Oasis just doesn‚Äôt compare when it comes to battery! I‚Äôm still debating returning and just getting the new Paperwhite for this reason alone. I love being able to travel and not having to worry about my battery depleting before I can charge again. If the battery wasn‚Äôt an issue I would definitely not have any problems keeping this Kindle!",

But I remained curious about the Oasis, especially when it was on sale for $175.  But I was too late in deciding.  I ended up buying used on you know what popular bidding site.  I got a nearly new one with Amazon cover for about what it had been on sale for.So now with both models on hand, I find myself mainly using the Oasis because of the page turn buttons.  I'm right-handed and usually hold the Oasis in my right hand.  But it is so convenient to turn it 180 degrees and put it in my left hand when the right hand gets tired.  The unit senses the orientation change, and the now top button becomes the page forward button.As for battery life, I've not been bothered at all.  I use it at home, so now and then I charge it at night.  No big deal at all.I could not normally justify the $135 price difference to the Paperwhite, but when on sale at $175, then yes, it's a good choice.",

I loved my old Kindle even though it was 11 years old.  I did a little research on the newer Kindles and decided on the Oasis, and I do NOT regret my decision.  I absolutely LOVE the Oasis.  It's a very user-friendly device.  It's light-weight and slim; it fits in my purse easily and does not weigh down the purse.  I haven't had it a week yet, but the battery life seems okay and the Oasis charges quickly.  I have an Amazon Fire that I HATE; the Fire tablet doesn't have a strong battery life and takes a long time to recharge.

I LOVED my Voyage (I have no idea why Amazon doesn't make a new generation of this but..) the etched glass and the lighting made it the closest to paper that a Kindle could get.  After it died I bought the new version of the Paperwhite which all the reviews say is the ""best"" but I wasn't happy. After having the Voyage the Paperwhite turned out to be a dissapointment...the screen is just too damn ""blue"" for me.  I saw the Oasis in Best Buy and loved the screen and the larger form, but I couldn't talk myself into paying that much for a KIndle when a few months earlier I just had bought one.  But Amazon discounted the price and I had an $80 Gift Card I had no idea I had (don't you love when that happens) and I bit the bullet.  I love it, the lighting system is uniform and the warm light can be adjusted so that it actually looks a much like paper that had aged a bit. Combined with the design of the Oasis and the larger screen it feels like you are back to reading a paperback...well, not to mention that most of the stuff I read is pulp trash, so it is like reading a paperback you picked up at the supermarket or the library.(remember those days...bad horror from the late 70s and they usually involved vampires attacking a small town or a psycho terrorizing a sorority and my 13 year old self could not put it down..)Long story short...I love the Oasis..the good, the larger screen and the lighting makes it feel like a real book, the bad...the size makes it difficult to stuff in your coat pocket and pull it out when waiting at the doctors office or getting your oil changed, and the price is ridiculous ...they need to bring it down to about $170. If you arent spoiled enough to care if your screen is tinted blue then stick with the PW.. but if you do and you read a lot commuting, etc...treat yourself..this is the best!",

For some reason, they sent me a reconditioned unit, without my agreement. WHY they would think this would be acceptable to me is completely unknown - especially when the Kindle I purchased, not even 2 months ago, was brand new. So‚Ä¶ Contacted them AGAIN and will be receiving a 4th unit (3rd replacement) tomorrow.[Original review]: This Oasis has issues. The first I purchased on Dec. 19th 2022, kept locking up - not waking up - or waking up to a blank screen - the only thing I could do was to re-boot. There was image shadowing from pervious pages - first only in dark mode, then in regular mode too. The shadowing from previous pages would overlap and create ‚Äúbars‚Äù of shadowing. I contacted Kindle (Amazon) product support, and they sent a replacement - the replacement is doing the exact same screen shadowing.I‚Äôve never had this happen with any other Kindle I‚Äôve owned - and I‚Äôve owned them all.I‚Äôve used and loved the Kindles since my first K2 - with the keyboard - I still have it and use it as a backup.I traded in my old Kindle Oasis (first Oasis edition, I think), with the integrated magnetic cover with battery pack, when I bought this newer version - and BOY, do I regret it now! I want my old one back! - which is impossible, and quite upsetting.I guess I‚Äôll have to contact Amazon again - this screen issue is completely unacceptable for a nearly $300 (not accounting for trade in and coupon) device.

It is versatile, easy to use, customizable and has been really a joy to use.  The different menus are fairly easy to access with one being accessible when you tap the top of the screen and the other being accessible when you swipe down.  It is easy to toggle between the home screen and my library screen and shopping for new books is very simple.  I can read with my left or right hand and it is intuitive for both hands.  Being left-handed, I really appreciate that.  Being able to take it poolside or read in a bath has been a pleasant extra.  The battery lasts for about 600 to 800 pages or more depending how much standby time you have and how fast you read.  It could be a bit snappier to open new books or flip when I turn it upside-down, but it flips pages quickly and more processing power would kill it for size and weight or cost.  I feel like it is the one thing I pick up and can just count on working well.If I had a gripe, it is the micro USB port.  For something that transitioned away from a headphone jack, I was surprised it was not USBC yet, but it is a matter of just keeping one small micro usb charger around and it charges from dead to full in about 2 hours and lasts me two weeks.

My first one was a Kindle 5th generation and then I moved on to a Kindle Paperwhite for the built-in light. I always miss the page turn buttons on my first kindle. So, with the Black Friday sale I purchased the newest Oasis for its buttons.Pro:- Ergonomic design. The machine is very comfortable to hold. On my Paperwhite, I use a special leather case that enables me to fold the case and hold the device in one hand. It has been working great except i) when I read while lie on my couch, I need two hands to hold my kindle for stability and ii) it's hard to flip to a previous page while holding it in the same hand. The Kindle Oasis solves the two problems perfectly!- Warm light. Reading my Oasis and my Paperwhite side-by-side, I realized that the warm light makes my eyes feel less irritated and makes the experience more similar to read a real book.- Responsiveness. I notice a speed up when I turn page. Very nice feature when I read fast.- Auto adjust light. When I read in the day I turn off light. At night in the darkness I opened my kindle and it automatically lights up, instead of having me turning on light -> change kindle light setting -> turning off light. I love this feature.Con:- Battery life. I read for a few hours per day. For some reason, the oasis needs charge every 3~4 days. It charges fast but I'd prefer the good old Kindle that lasts weeks. The problem might be alleviated by turning on airplane mode or turning off light. I also wonder if this has anything to do with my enabling ""auto adjust light"" feature.- Hard to find a protective case. The device is great to hold WITHOUT any case. I have tried a few cases and every single one of them made the device harder to hold while reading due to slippery and due to me reading books while lying down. I decided to purchase a kindle sleeve instead.",

Kindle Oasis ‚Äì With 7‚Äù display and page turn buttons,3.0,A lot of room for improvement with an archaic WIFI,"Reviewed in the United States on June 2, 2022",Digital Storage Capacity: 8 GB | Offer Type: Lockscreen Ad-Supported | Color: Graphite | Option: Without Kindle Unlimited,True,"The waterproofing was the primary reason I picked this model and it works as advertised. The battery life is great and it holds a lot of books.The WIFI is archaic, I have nothing that can connect to it wirelessly. The built-in light works well, but it's either too blue or yellow for my taste. I think the touch screen software needs tweaking, e.g. attempting to highlight a single word will net a sentence more often than not, then you have to wait for the system delay or your highlight will move unpredictably, then you can adjust the highlight (it shouldn't take more than two or three attempts). I primarily use the buttons to flip pages because sometimes the touchscreen isn't very intuitive, e.g. touching the right side of the screen to advance doesn't always work, will go back a page (or more), or will activate the menu - all of which can be a bit disorienting. The Oasis runs slow compared to modern devices, so if you're a fast reader, keep large libraries of books, or are just impatient you might be better off using the app. After scrolling through 10 ""pages"" of my library I give up and go online to see what books I want to revisit or to find the unread books lost in the shuffle. There's a lot of unused space around the buttons and on the backside an awkward hump. The Oasis would have been better served if that awkward hump was better distributed and the device made narrower for more ways to handle it while reading and for ease of transporting. Outside of these quirks, I've enjoyed using it but there's a lot of room for improvement.",One person found this helpful

I always read in landscape mode and held the device using the upper and lower bezels which had enough of space for holding. Worked great. Wanted to get something with a backlight for more dimly lit situations (my original device, despite being 10 years old, still works perfectly) so I got a base model kindle. Works great, but with no top bezel, my left hand-hold was gone. I feel the hand placement for that device is just not ideal. After having bought that, I was no longer in the market for this, as ‚Äúit‚Äôs mildly uncomfortable to hold‚Äù wasn‚Äôt reason enough to spend more money. But I got this for Christmas and I absolutely love it. The handhold is great, physical buttons are very conveniently placed, the gyroscope with the autorotate is a dream. Higher pixel density is very welcome as I like reading with a smaller font, faster refresh, faster response time. Everything about this is just perfect.

So I decided on the Kindle Oasis. I love the ergonomic design. The side buttons and the ability to flip it and hold it how I want, are my favorite features. The one thing I despise is the battery life. The description says it can last up to six weeks, but I haven't found this to be true. When I was reading daily, I could understand why it would die faster. But when I'm listening to audiobooks and don't pick up my Kindle for days at a time, it still loses juice. My old Paperwhite would never have that issue. I was holding off hoping they would upgrade the Oasis before I purchased, but I heard rumors they might be phasing these out. I hope it's not true because I would absolutely buy another in the future if they can figure out the battery issue.",One person found this helpful
Kindle Oasis ‚Äì With 7‚Äù display and page turn buttons,3.0,Good overall but really should be better,"Reviewed in the United States on August 4, 2019",Digital Storage Capacity: 8 GB | Offer Type: Lockscreen Ad-Supported | Color: Graphite | Option: Without Kindle Unlimited,True,"Update: As of October 2019, this problem has been resolved. Amazon must have done some tweaking and now I am able to download books written in traditional Chinese and sold in the Kindle store onto my kindle device. Well done!However, after a couple of months of using this device, I'm surprised by how difficult it is to make highlights on this device (compared to using the kindle app on my ipad). It almost always takes a few tries for me to do the highlights correctly. And navigating the various functions (even as simple as display settings, finding where you are in the book, etc) is not very intuitive. I'm keeping it because compared to the ipad, this device emits less blue light and is better for my eyes and it's smaller and lighter for carrying.  But I agree with others that the device really needs a major upgrade/innovation._______________________________________________________________________________This is the first kindle device I ever owned. I used to read kindle books on my Ipad using the kindle app.Then in May 2019, Amazon launched a portal in the Kindle store with 20,000 Traditional Chinese titles, with much fanfare. The news was greeted with much enthusiasm by the tens of millions of people who read Traditional Chinese around the globe. Excited about this, I purchased books written in traditional Chinese from this new kindle portal and read them with no problem on my Ipad. And in July/August 2019, Amazon released this latest model of the kindle oasis and I decided to invest in one. Alas, once I received it and had it all set up and connected, I was dismayed to find that, while all my English kindle books downloaded on the device beautifully, my kindle books written in Traditional Chinese could not be downloaded!! I chatted on line with Amazon customer care rep and she confirmed that at this time, these books cannot be downloaded to the latest model of Kindle Oasis (they may be compatible with the older models of Oasis).In addition, while the portal for Traditional Chinese books claims to carry about 20,000 titles, this kindle oasis device does not have ""Traditional Chinese"" as an option in its language settings. (It does have Simplified Chinese).This is all hugely disappointing! Given how pricey this model is who would have thought that it cannot download Amazon's own kindle books? It is really ironic that kindle books sold by Amazon CANNOT be read on the latest kindle device but can be read on the Ipad with no issue at all. If everything can be done (and is easier) on the ipad perhaps I should just stick with the Ipad and not bother with owning another device.The device works well if you only need it for English books and many others have/will provide much more detailed reviews. It's just that I purchased it with my mind set on buying many more Traditional Chinese books from Amazon and reading them on it, and turns out this device does not support this function! I'm still on the fence about returning this one. I'm hoping this is something that Amazon will address/rectify quickly with a software update.",3 people found this helpful

I like Kindle Oasis the best because of the fonts, the display, the adjustable light and they just feel and look better.  I enjoy reading it because the other models no matter how I try to adjust the font, the font size, the columns, they are readable and definitely useable but somehow you just cannot make it look and feel like a Kindle Oasis.  Buying a Kindle Oasis costs more but think of it as a one time purchase that can turn all your Kindle books into better looking and better reading pages and hopefully we can enjoy it for many years which make the price very reasonable.  If you like reading Kindle and you can afford it I highly recommend Kindle Oasis.

I timed 8 hours of non use (midnight to 8 am, had it in essentially standby mode) and it had drained 3% of battery. this would be 9% per day and means (if my math is right) that the unit drain a full charge in about 10 or 11 days until discharged even if I don't touch it. For a unit that brags about ""weeks"" between charges, I cannot see how this is possible. I didn't return in the 30 day window, and am regretting that a bit.

Kindle Oasis ‚Äì With 7‚Äù display and page turn buttons,5.0,A simple review - an upgrade from Kindle Paperwhite to the Kindle Oasis.,"Reviewed in the United States on August 11, 2019",Digital Storage Capacity: 8 GB | Offer Type: Lockscreen Ad-Supported | Color: Graphite | Option: Without Kindle Unlimited,True,"I upgraded from a 2016 Kindle Paperwhite to this new Kindle Oasis and I am glad I did... I was contemplating on upgrading to the new Paperwhite when it was released in 2018, but the upgrade they made in my opinion was not worth spending the money for the same device I already have with the exception of ‚Äúwater proof‚Äù. This upgrade to the paperwhite was not important to me so I waited to see what will come next from other Kindle devices... Come July of 2019 the Kindle Oasis was released and it sound to me that it will be a good upgrade from what I currently have. But I was still a bit hesitant because of the price tag but with my trade-in and the 25% off that Amazon offered when you pre-order the device, then the upgrade made it all worth it for me... The Kindle Oasis is the ultimate eReader amongst all the Kindle devices in my opinion and I‚Äôve had several other Kindle eReader devices in the past. I love the different reading light settings including the automatic light adjustment feature that adjust accordingly. This to me is my favorite. It makes reading a lot easier and softer on the eyes no matter what the lighting condition is. The weight of the device is another thing that I love about it. It is lightweight compared to the Paperwhite so I can hold my Kindle longer without my hands getting tired. Another feature I love is the different orientation of the screen. It adjusts to however you want to hold the device either with your right or left hand or setting it down on a table if you prefer. This is a feature I did not have with my Paperwhite so I was so excited about this as well. The Kindle Oasis is very responsive and the battery life is excellent... I am pleased and absolutely glad I made this upgrade. The Kindle Oasis 2019 is well worth the upgrade for all its features... I also bought the official Amazon Kindle Oasis case ($39) as it is the perfect fit for this device (none of the non-Amazon brands works). The case fits perfectly without adding more weight to the device and it makes holding the Oasis more comfortable and secure.",One person found this helpful
Kindle Oasis ‚Äì With 7‚Äù display and page turn buttons,2.0,DO NOT ALLOW THE SOFTWARE UPDATE INSTALLED IN MARCH 2022,"Reviewed in the United States on March 22, 2022",Digital Storage Capacity: 32 GB | Offer Type: Lockscreen Ad-Supported | Color: Graphite | Option: Without Kindle Unlimited,True,"Overall, owning and using all of my Kindle devices has been a reasonably pleasant experience. Unfortunately, last night I realized something that I probably should have known but for whatever reason, I didn't. Amazon forces software updates to Kindles and doesn't give you a choice on whether to install or not. Apparently, mostly it hasn't bothered me. I did notice with my last Oasis purchase that it now takes me several additional taps to change just about any setting whereas in the past, all of the most used ones (airplane on/off for example) were available with one touch.This latest update infuriated me. It is so unnecessary.Effective with this update, I can no longer view any of the items in my library in a list form. I am forced to view everything by book cover. For me, this is unacceptable. I read fast and absorb a page of text (especially lists) in a glance. When you have as many books on your Kindle as I do taking in a full list page of titles quickly is essential unless you want to spend all day scrolling. (Of course, I'd type it in a search box if the typing function actually worked properly.) Now, instead of being able to click quickly through the list, I have to wait for each page to redraw all of the covers on the screen before I can move on to the next page. And it will only show six covers at a time. Each page requires that I stop and decipher the cover to find the actual title because there is no consistency to the text, which takes time that I don't want to spend.Not only that, it also will not allow me to look at a list of my collections. It now shows each collection as a book cover. With several hundred pages of books and 40 to 60 pages of books contained in various collections, this has become a navigational nightmare.This is ridiculous Amazon. Seriously. I'm not 3 years old. I don't need pictures to choose a book. I can actually read. If I wanted to look at all the pretty pictures I'd buy a Nat Geo picture book from a bookstore. I want to R-E-A-D and I want to find what I want quickly. You have severely hobbled my ability to locate and move from book to book and I AM NOT HAPPY ABOUT IT.Further, a call to Amazon support to find out if maybe I had just missed seeing the setting in preferences confirmed the fact that I no longer have a choice in how the contents of my Kindle are displayed. Of course, given the not-so-high quality of Amazon support that may or may not be true, but it's what they told me today.Relatively speaking, it now takes forever to navigate through my library. For this reason alone I can no longer give the Kindle a glowing review or anything close to it. We all have our priorities so this may not matter to some but it matters a lot to me.Guess I'll mosey on over to Barnes & Noble and see what my eReader options are over there these days.",14 people found this helpful

Again here, the ‚Äúold‚Äù functionality and it the option to turn the page from either side (and or both top and bottom, depending on the layout you choose) not being limited to just one side was far superior.

If you leave your wireless on, it depletes pretty quickly and if you download books, even faster. The first Oasis was much worse.  It had a battery located in the cover that you had to buy and another battery in the kindle.  When my cover started to wear, I had to cut the battery out of the cover which allowed me not to have to buy a new cover for $59. The added battery lasted a few days, but the battery in the kindle only lasted a couple of days. The new Oasis is a vast improvement.  However, it still needs a battery that performs like the Paperwhite.  I do use the Oasis at home.  If I travel, I always take the Paperwhite,  which is about 1/2 the price of the Oasis.  It's a great kindle, but even with the best charger that you buy for the Oasis, I have never had a 100% fully charged  kindle.  Also, it starts depleting right away.  I am lucky if I get two to three days before it needs to be charged again.  You would think with a good product, would warrant a good battery.  Also, I have an Oasis with all the things you tout about the Oasis.  Mine is at least a year old.  Yet, you are saying it is new and you have upped the price of your product to $349.  Amazon & Jeff Bezos has a a bazillion dollars, but they can't make a decent battery to power a superior product, thus make it not a superior product.

As a long time kindle fan from the second Gen to the Paperwhite to the Voyage I couldn't wait for my upgrade! When I opened it I loved it! I love the larger screen, the amber light the ability listen to audible books - it was great. I did a software update and then charged my Oasis to 100%. This is where I noticed a problem with my battery draining quickly while on airplane mode with the back light turned off. I am so disappointed. I thought the Oasis would last a couple of weeks on a single charge but at this rate it won't even make it a couple days. If the battery wasn't  an issue I would love the Oasis! I am hoping that there is just a battery issue in some newly released models and that Amazon will correct what seems to be a growing issue.Update: Amazon technical support reach out to me - we‚Äôre very nice, tried to help troubleshoot the issue. They sent prepaid shipping to send my kindle to them and they will be sending me another Oasis in 2 days. I am optimistic this will correct the battery issue. I will post more when the new device arrives. I am happy with Amazon customer/technical service.I received my new Oasis and the battery life is better but nowhere near as good as my Kindle Voyage. I read on the device for a month and have decided to keep my new Oasis. The reason I am keeping it are: 1. I like the amber light 2. I like the larger reading area and 3. I can use Bluetooth to listen to Audible and go between book and audible. A total game changer was buying the oragami case for my new Oasis. This allows me to hold it with the groves on the back of the Oasis as well as on the Oragami folder side. This was a winner for me and  those are the reasons I do really like it.

Overall, it's very readable and I usually reach  for it over the paperwhite so I guess that's the whole point.  Cons or, more accurately, annoyances.  Again, as many have mentioned, it's a double whammy of not great battery life combined with the ridiculous micro USB charger.  I'm sorry, this is the top of the line kindle?  It's way worse than even my old non paperwhite kindles. The bump.  This doesn't seem to bother many other people but it drives me nuts, it feels uneven both physically and by weight.

Yes, at some point it actually feels like you're getting ripped off to have to still pay to get rid of the ads.  I'd say that $200 plus price point is it.

Kindle Oasis ‚Äì With 7‚Äù display and page turn buttons,3.0,Kindle Family Lacks Any Real Innovation,"Reviewed in the United States üá∫üá∏ on July 29, 2019",Digital Storage Capacity: 8 GB | Offer Type: Lockscreen Ad-Supported | Color: Graphite | Option: Without Kindle Unlimited,True,"For the past few years, Amazon has seemed content to follow the e-reader pack rather than lead it and provide true innovation in its Kindle lineup. This version of the Oasis is no exception. While this latest Oasis adds the option for warm (amber) light, which is a plus for me since I tend to read a night, Kobo and Nook have had this feature for years. Amazon touted that its Oasis and now Paperwhite are ‚Äúwaterproof.‚Äù Big deal. Kobo did that in 2014. A 7‚Äù screen on the Oasis version 2 in 2017! Again, Kobo did that in 2013. The ability to change the boldness of fonts and provide some customization was provided by Kobo back in 2011. The Kobo Forma, an 8-inch radically different e-reader, shows what REAL innovation is. Go take a look at it.Let‚Äôs talk pricing. $249 (with Special Offers) $269 without them. The top of the line Nook is $199. And only Amazon makes you PAY to have an e-reader without advertisement. Let‚Äôs be honest, that‚Äôs what ‚Äúspecial offers‚Äù are, ads.The Kindle ecosystem is second to none, unmatched by Kobo or even Barnes and Noble. That‚Äôs what keeps me with Kindle. It would be nice, however, if their e-reader line-up matched their industry leading eco-system. The big change between the Oasis version 2 and version 3 is warm light. Hardly innovation. Is it worth the upgrade? You need to make that decision. The screen is truly beautiful and evenly lit, the automatic light adjustment (including amber-warm light) is customizable and works perfectly, the software is excellent, and page turns are lightning fast.But wait, the Kindle Paperwhite is now available in Twilight Blue! Now that‚Äôs some innovation, LOL!",646 people found this helpful

It was a good product for its time, but I never really got into it.  I missed the feeling, sensation, touch, feel and smell of an actual book; my kindle ended up sitting on the shelf.  Fast forward several years and I decided to venture into the technology once again, but I decided to purchase from another company.  I couldn't put the reader down and found that the integration and simplicity of borrowing books from the library amazing.  When their newest reader came out toward the end of last year, I was one of the first to buy it and probably the first to return it.  Although I really liked the reader, the battery was only lasting about 20 minutes and I usually read more than that in a day.  I went back to the previous model and ended up misplacing it (ugh) and went without a reader for about 5 months.  Apart from the simplicity of borrowing books from the library with my previous reader, the warm lighting was one of my favorite features.  I had started looking at kindle as a replacement, but since I read a lot at night, I didn't want one without the warm lighting.  When I heard rumors that amazon was working on adding the feature, I decided to wait and I'm not disappointed.  The Oasis 3 is a lot smaller than my previous reader and I thought that it would be too small, but I find the size perfect to hold.  It takes a few extra steps to borrow books from the library, but it's manageable.  The selection of books available on Amazon is way more extensive then the other company.  I'm liking the integration of Goodreads and the simplicity of reviewing books and logging my reads onto the platform.  The dictionary works flawlessly, the translation is ok and the wikipedia is an added feature from my previous model that I'm taking advantage of.  I've had it for less than a week and I've read several books.  I look forward to many more reads with my new companion.  Thanks kindle",3 people found this helpful

Kindle Oasis ‚Äì With 7‚Äù display and page turn buttons,4.0,Parkinson‚Äôs/handicapped friendly (kinda-sorta),"Reviewed in the United States on August 4, 2019",Digital Storage Capacity: 8 GB | Offer Type: Lockscreen Ad-Supported | Color: Graphite | Option: Without Kindle Unlimited,True,"As someone with dexterity issues, I like that the Kindle Oasis is so lightweight and easy to handle. If these are important e-reader features to you as well, choose your cover carefully as a poorly designed cover can undermine the reading experience. Since I do most of my reading at home I have pretty much opted for going coverless unless I‚Äôm throwing my device in my backpack. Add to this ‚Äúplus‚Äù the fact that unlike other Kindles the Oasis has page turning buttons and allows the user to turn off the touchscreen feature. As a person with a tremor more prominent in my right (but still dominant) hand,  I appreciate not having to worry so much about mis-triggering my device. Especially sweet is the fact that the two buttons‚Äô functionality (factory setting = top button forward and bottom button backward) stays the same whether you are holding the device in your left or right hand. BUT you can change these assignations in Settings if, like me, you prefer to advance to the next page with your thumb, which positions more comfortably near the bottom button. I am at a stage in my Parkinson‚Äôs disease that vision and concentration issues are becoming worrisome. The Kindle Oasis, like many e-readers, allows me to make adjustments to fonts, line-spacing, and screen brightness.This brings me to the reason why I am giving the Oasis four stars, not five. Unlike the Kindle apps for my iPad and iPhone (and the Kindle Fire), the Oasis does NOT allow me to read the text at the same time as I listen to the audiobook, although the two are synced. Instead, I am forced to choose one or the other. Listening to the book at the same time as reading the printed text has been key to my ability to improve my comprehension. [Promise to readers of this review: I will continue to visit help sites to see if there is a way I can turn on a sync function. If such exists, I will revise my review.]",10 people found this helpful
Kindle Oasis ‚Äì With 7‚Äù display and page turn buttons,5.0,Love that the print will flip,"Reviewed in the United States on October 1, 2021",Digital Storage Capacity: 32 GB | Offer Type: Lockscreen Ad-Supported | Color: Champagne Gold | Option: Without Kindle Unlimited,True,"I read at night so when the Paperwhite came out I was in heaven. After a few years I moved on to the Voyage, and now I have the Oasis. My reason for trying the Oasis originally is that the light can be manipulated differently than the previous models. This one not only has the brightness choice, but also the ability to ""yellow"" the screen a bit so it doesn't glare. I actually found that is the least used feature for me. When I originally got my Oasis I noticed it was easy to hold and it has the page forward/back buttons on the thicker side that one holds onto. You can also change the order forward/back buttons are in. The default setting is the bottom button is for going back a page and I found that annoying. Then I discovered that I can go into the settings and make the bottom button the page-forward button which worked much better for me (a quick tap with my thumb). What has turned out to be my favorite feature is the way the print will ""right itself"" when I flip the Kindle over (like a cell phone). I usually lay on my side when I read and have to flip over every now and then - the print automatically flips when the Kindle is switched from my left hand to my right hand (you have to flip it over to keep holding onto the thicker side with the buttons).",One person found this helpful
Kindle Oasis ‚Äì With 7‚Äù display and page turn buttons,4.0,HOW TO SOLVE SLIPPERY GRIP,"Reviewed in the United States on August 8, 2019",Digital Storage Capacity: 8 GB | Offer Type: Lockscreen Ad-Supported | Color: Graphite | Option: Without Kindle Unlimited,True,"A 5-star device if it weren't so slippery. The aluminum feels nice, sounds nice, seems nice, but it's not practical for one-handed holding. I absolutely prefer the rubbery texture of the Paperwhite and Voyage. The Oasis is fine when held below head-level (e.g., you're sitting in an upright position). But as soon as you try to hold it above head-level, such as when lying down in bed, it becomes difficult to grip.See attached pictures, I solved that problem with this adhesive grip product: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07DD532WM. It's a bit of a ridiculous and unsightly solution, but it is effective. Why not just use a case? Mainly because I don't want the added weight or bulk. If you do end up using adhesive grip strips, be sure to clean your device first with rubbing alcohol.A few other notes about the Oasis:- The screen is amazingly perfect. Great contrast, no dark spots, no uneven lighting, noticeably faster page turns.- I love the warm light, I don't think I could go back- Battery life is fine for me. As others have mentioned, the device may user more battery at the beginning as it's downloading/updating/indexing.- I don't care that this charges via micro USB. Some people are really losing sleep over this- The extra inch of the 7-inch screen is very nice to haveLastly, form factor on the Oasis. We have a love-hate relationship. I love the buttons. I love the extra inch of the 7"" screen. I appreciate how they kept the bulk to one side of the device to make it feel lighter, though I do miss having grips and buttons on either side like I did with my Voyage. What I hate, other than the slick aluminum, is the fact that I can't fit this thing in my pocket. I am on-the-go a lot, and it matters to me.When Amazon releases a Paperwhite with warm light, I'll probably buy one for on-the-go. But the Oasis will otherwise be my primary reading device.",13 people found this helpful
Kindle Oasis ‚Äì With 7‚Äù display and page turn buttons,4.0,Absolutely love this but has minor drawbacks that could be improved upon,"Reviewed in the United States on December 15, 2019",Digital Storage Capacity: 32 GB | Offer Type: Lockscreen Ad-Supported | Color: Graphite | Option: Without Kindle Unlimited,True,"The biggest complaint I have with this device is that it‚Äôs a gigantic square. It‚Äôs an abnormally sized device that doesn‚Äôt fit in compact carrying bags like the other kindles do. I would much rather have a slightly thicker device if it meant reducing the button bezel. I understand you need somewhere to hold onto, maybe in future builds it can have ‚Äúdead zones‚Äù that disable the bottom screen corners from touches while reading, so you can hold it like a normal book at a ‚Äúspine.‚Äù Also, maybe page turn buttons on the back. Idk, just the square shape is unconventional.Also, good luck finding a case that‚Äôs comfortable. The main ones that protect the whole body and screen, when you fold the screen back it makes a sharp awkward triangle. You have to hold the screen guard flap thingy with one finger while the rest of your hand holds that grip section. I‚Äôm trying out a case that just sticks to the flatter part and makes a flush fold, but that‚Äôs coming later.My other gripe, though minor, is there‚Äôs about a 3 second load time whenever I open my Kindle. It doesn‚Äôt just show me the ad, it has to like, boot the device from sleep mode. Like I said, minor, probably will be patched out soon.That warm glow is A LOT better on your eyes for night reading 10/10 should be on all kindles. As a matter of fact Amazon, remove those blue LEDs entirely and only use orange ones.I do wish Amazon would collaborate better with local libraries for easier book borrowing, but that‚Äôs not just related to the Oasis.Bring back Active Content Amazon, I‚Äôd pay to play Sudoku, Scrabble, Battleship, and other board games on my Kindle, especially with that larger screen. Maybe even make them free to Kindle Unlimited subscribers ;)",

I decided to get a Kindle device to save wear and tear on my eyes since looking at a backlit screen in the dark isn't the greatest for your eyes.

I have never measured it but I suspect I can get in 60+ hours of reading in on a single charge *IF* I turn on airplane mode.  Without airplane mode I saw the battery drain at probably 10x speed so keeping an idle WIFI connect up must put a lot of strain on the battery.I'm knocking off 1 star because of the old school USB connector as well as the lack of a search web feature like all the Kindle apps on Android, IOS, PC support.  When reading a series with lots of characters the X-ray feature is not adequate when you have dedicated book wiki pages that just need to be searched online (no the search Wikipedia feature is not sufficient either).I hope the next generation has support for a fold out 2nd screen, colour screens, USB-C, and wireless charging.

I wasn't sure which one I would go with but after doing my own research I decided on the Kindle Oasis for the bigger screen, the extra LEDS, and the page turning buttons. I love reading but its getting harder for me to do because of my eyes not being as good as they used to be. I get migraines frequently and when I try to read conventional books, the extra eye strain makes those migraines worse and/or come about more often. It's also getting harder to hold books for longer periods of time due to joint pains in my hands so instead of putting my books away for good, I decided to try an E-Reader. I ordered this product and it came about 2 days later, so shipping was fast and reliable. Everything came in perfect working order and it was easy to set up. I am already a Prime member so everything I needed to get started getting my paper book collection in ebook form was just a few clicks away. The customization on the brightness level is great. I can read in low to no light or bright light with no problem. Font sizes can be changed for me to see the words easier and bookmarking where I've left off is a breeze.

I mean, I didn't know how much easier it would be on the eyes to warm it up, and it adds a hue to the page in normal light that makes it feel more like paper.The feel of the thick side in my hand makes it a really one-handed device*The size of the screen means I can up the text size ever so slightly, or fit a bit more text on the screen as compared to my Voyage.The physical buttons! Squeeee! Oh how I've missed actual really real buttons! It's just so much nicer for page turning!What I don't love:*It's only a one-handed device without the cover on it. The cover is rigid, and if you fold it back it defeats the nice thicker portion as a handhold and becomes a bit awkward. That said, the fabric cover is very nice looking.It's heavier than my wife's first gen Oasis. That thing feels like nothing in your hands. This could be lighter, but it's not bad.What I would change:Oh if I could bring back the magnetic cover of my wife's Oasis and honestly the size of the first gen, that would be perfect. The warmer light with the size and weight and one-gesture removable cover of the original would be nirvana.I'd love USB-C charging, but to be honest; it's not that big of a deal. Not to mention the larger USB-C port on my phone must have the lint dug out of it from time to time just to plug in.Summary:One or two minor quibbles and mixed feelings on the size/weight aside; this is a magnificent reader. Crisp, responsive, and easy on the eyes. This is a tremendous upgrade over my Voyage, and a worthy successor to the Oasis we've had in our house until now. If you have one to trade in, it comes out of the price of the new one too! If you can swing it (I know it's spend-y), cannot recommend this enough.",6 people found this helpful

One of my best decisions of 2020.I've used the Oasis for close to a year now, and it has made reading a delightful experience. As nice as the Paperwhite was, there are some things about it that, while at the time didn't bother me, seem antiquated. Example: lacking physical buttons. Seems trivial, but with the Oasis my thumb doesn't move an inch during a 2-hour reading session except to look up a word. With the Paperwhite, you had to move your thumb and touch the page every time you wanted to go to the next page. I don't know how I ever put up with such a cumbersome design.The weight is another one. The Oasis is lighter than even the smallest paperbacks I've had the pleasure of reading.Lastly, speed. The Oasis is fast. Maybe I just had my Paperwhite too long, but it got to the point where turning a page took 5 seconds at times. Turning pages on Oasis is instant and trust me, you really notice this.Those are the two most noticeable upgrades of the Oasis that its predecessors lack, of course, there are other features: higher resolution, warm light display, longer battery, but none of them are as pertinent as weight, physical buttons, and speed. As someone who uses the Oasis several hours a day, features like these two are all that matter. Yes I would have preferred USB-C, but realistically your kindle needs charging about once a month.

Kindle Oasis ‚Äì With 7‚Äù display and page turn buttons,5.0,Best reading experience yet,"Reviewed in the United States on October 14, 2020",Digital Storage Capacity: 8 GB | Offer Type: Lockscreen Ad-Supported | Color: Graphite | Option: Without Kindle Unlimited,True,"This is by far the best reading experience I've had. I was skeptical about spending $250 on the Oasis when my Paperwhite was half that, wasn't sure I'd like the buttons or asymmetric design, worried the color temperature might be gimmicky. But this was absolutely worth it. My perspective: if you primarily read via ereader and can afford an Oasis, you should get an Oasis. If you only read via ereader sometimes, stick with a PW, it's still a nice device.The Oasis's larger display, color temperature, and buttons are all great. But the Oasis has better contrast, which to me is the most important part. By comparison the 2019 PW4 looks a tad gray and murky. The Oasis is just easier to read, and more like real paper.The battery life isn't as good as the PW, which is to be expected. With wireless/bluetooth off, it lasts me 15-20 hours of reading. Amazon advertises ""weeks of battery life"" by spreading those hours over multiple weeks, but you can expect to drain the whole thing in one wild weekend too. That isn't too bad though, as it charges faster than the PW. If you have good charging habits and sleep or stretch your legs every few days, you'll be just fine.Micro-USB rather than USB-C is the biggest (only) disappointment to me. That decision is not aging well, and I expect to hang on to this Kindle for many years. But there are worse things in life, and I like the Oasis too much to drop a star for that.I'd recommend the Ayotu Skin Touch cover, and a pop socket. The cover comes off while reading, and the pop socket prevents dropping the Kindle on your face while reading in bed.",One person found this helpful

Kindle Oasis ‚Äì With 7‚Äù display and page turn buttons,4.0,There are some disappointments regarding Kindle Oasis,"Reviewed in the United States on July 22, 2020",Digital Storage Capacity: 8 GB | Offer Type: Lockscreen Ad-Supported | Color: Graphite | Option: Without Kindle Unlimited,True,"This Kindle is easy to read, but there are some things I really don't like.The first problem is the Kindle Oasis is too slippery. It seems like it has Teflon on it, and that makes it difficult to hold. If my fingers are a bit sweaty, I can hold on to it better, but when I have dry fingers it's really hard to hold. I end up turning off the touch screen so I can get a better grip by holding on to the screen, but that makes it inconvenient to access the features of the Kindle. It would be better to have a surface with more texture to it.The other thing is, the battery does not last long when the LED back light is on. If the back light is fairly bright, the Oasis battery life is more like the battery life a laptop computer than what I expect from a Kindle. My guess it that I won't get more than 8-10 hours of reading with the back light set to around 20, which I need because I am old and my eyes are not very good. This isn't a show-stopper, but why advertise that battery life is weeks because it really isn't in most cases?One final complaint. When you turn the Kindle on with the button or by opening the cover, you have to swipe your finger across the bottom of the display to unlock the device. That is just an extra step that's required to start reading and doesn't seem to add anything worthwhile. Why not just unlock when the device turns on without the extra swipe?",One person found this helpful

I eventually decided to buy the Oasis.Things I like:- the screen being a little bigger is nice (slightly more text on the screen)- the ability to turn pages using either the physical buttons (which I find a little loud), or just touching the screen- automatic lighting and the ‚Äúwarm‚Äù lighting seems to work well - no ‚Äúhot spots‚ÄùThings that aren‚Äôt so good:- wake up time is slower than my 2012 Paperwhite- some ‚Äúghosting‚Äù of text on the screen is sometimes visible (eg when going to a new page, you can sometimes see faint images of text from the previous page)- battery life (in airplane mode, so no radios or Bluetooth active) is poorer than my old Paperwhite .... it‚Äôs still fine for a business trip or vacation, but I‚Äôm guessing more like 2-3 weeks instead of 1-2 months with my old Paperwhite under the same amount of reading- home screen layout...  seems a little harder to find my books (not really hard, just was simpler on my old Paperwhite)- comfort .....  the design of the Oasis is interesting, but would be uncomfortable without a caseOverall, I‚Äôm not unhappy with the Oasis, but with hindsight, I‚Äôd probably be just as happy with the new Paperwhite.",3 people found this helpful
Kindle Oasis ‚Äì With 7‚Äù display and page turn buttons,5.0,Really like it,"Reviewed in the United States on July 29, 2019",Digital Storage Capacity: 32 GB | Offer Type: Lockscreen Ad-Supported | Color: Graphite | Option: Without Kindle Unlimited,True,"So far so good.  I guess I don't understand a couple of the bad reviews for the reasons they give - 1) It doesn't have USB-C, which does not affect its functionality as a reader at all, and 2) it doesn't do what a Fire does.  Well, both these were easily seen from the description.  Why order it in the first place?I bought it because of the bigger screen area and the ability to adjust the temperature of the light.  It does both of these very well.  I will know more about the battery life as I use it, and like other rechargables like cell phones, I will judge after it has gone through 2 or 3 charge/discharge cycles.  I have used it for an hour per night for the couple of nights since I got it, seems pretty good so far.  I leave the wifi off unless I am downloading books.  If it turns bad, I will come back and readjust my review.I like the way it feels, but the way I hold my reader (in my left hand, one-handed) it felt really unbalanced until I turned it upside down... that works great for me, holding the thick side in my left hand.I am a junky for these things, I have an old kindle, a couple of generations of paperwhites, and a voyage.  Did I really need this?  Probably not.  But I read every night, and on planes, etc.  So I felt like I could justify it.  Since it came with 6 months of kindle unlimited, which I already subscribe to, that was a $60+ discount that helped in that justification.So for what I bought it for, the lighting and the size, and the basic ability to read books with it, it is great so far.  I like having more text on the page at the same size (fewer page turns).  The lighting is very even and good for my eyes, it responds fast, and it is pleasant to read on.",2 people found this helpful

Kindle Oasis ‚Äì With 7‚Äù display and page turn buttons,4.0,Great But Not Worth Full Price,"Reviewed in the United States on December 29, 2019",Digital Storage Capacity: 8 GB | Offer Type: Lockscreen Ad-Supported | Color: Graphite | Option: Without Kindle Unlimited,True,"I got this on a Black Friday deal, plus used the trade-in 25% off, otherwise I wouldn't have purchased it at full price.I had a Kindle Voyage, which was starting to be a little slow and I was curious about the warm light on the Oasis, so I took the deal when I had it. If I could go back and know what I know, I wouldn't have ""upgraded"".Why the 4 stars, then? Because if you're just buying a Kindle, this one is really awesome. The large screen is wonderful for night time reading, when your pupils have dilated, so you can't see small text very well. I love how I can turn it whichever way is most comfortable to hold. I have even tried the landscape position, which is great. I do wish it could switch as easily between landscape and portrait mode as it does from right side up to upside down, but that isn't enough to complain about.The warm light is a little underwhelming for me. I do prefer the lighting of my Voyage and I haven't been able to replicate it on the Oasis. I do have sensitive eyes, though, so this is most likely not the same for everyone.The battery life seems to do pretty well. It holds up just like all of my Kindles have in the past. Over time, I'm not sure yet.Overall, if you can get this Kindle for the same deal that I did (which was actually less than the original price of my Voyage), it's well worth it. If you are thinking about upgrading from a Voyage or maybe even a Paperwhite, think hard about what you are looking for in your upgrade and if its worth the money.",2 people found this helpful

I got the extra 32 gigs of memory and a nice leather case. I have just begun to use it. The touch screen is not very responsive, I have to often touch it several times. It did not come with a users manual; really!!?? I had to order one separately. If I am not too savvy [We are not all millennials, I'm old school 72 years old.] how am I going to open it and find an internal manual or download one?  I spend nearly $300 and and you can't print a paper Starter Manual? Other than that It is very good and comfortable to use.  I like the readable screen and I can make the type size big enough to eliminate the eye strain.  I've read the paper back manual twice and I can now pretty much use some of the huge number of features.  I am very particular about the dictionary I use and the only thing I can find loaded is a chopped down Oxford. I probably just haven't figured out yet where to get and download  American Heritage.

Kindle Oasis ‚Äì With 7‚Äù display and page turn buttons,4.0,It‚Äôs very good and easier on the eyes than my older Paperwhite,"Reviewed in the United States on June 27, 2020",Digital Storage Capacity: 8 GB | Offer Type: Lockscreen Ad-Supported | Color: Graphite | Option: Without Kindle Unlimited,True,"UPDATE:  I am keeping the 4 stars because of the readability of the product, but the battery life is poor. My other kindles could go on a trip with me and need a charge once every 3 weeks.  This one lasts 5 days.  Definitely not a product you‚Äôll take on a 2 week camping trip with limited charging facilities!  For the price, I find that a bit of a pity.ORIGINAL:  I ordered it on June 5 and was told it would be delivered on June 28th.  I was pleasantly surprised to have it arrive within a week.  It was simple to set up and was delightfully lightweight!  It took a little while to get used to the wedge, and I‚Äôm not sure ‚Äîwith small hands‚Äî whether I truly adjusted. I had ordered a cover which makes it a moot point.  The cover, for your info, was also very lightweight, but gives the ultralight oasis significantly more heft.The readability using the warm light was terrific. After all day on a computer, and an iPad in the evening, it was sometimes tiring to read my Paperwhite, but the Oasis is lovely.  The text feels clearer and the touch screen is responsive.  I am, however, totally disappointed in the battery life.  I read about 40-60 minutes a day and the oasis needs to be charged once a week.  For something this expensive I would have expected better battery life.  On the bright side, unlike my old Paperwhite, this kindle charges fully in about 60-75 minutes.",One person found this helpful
Kindle Oasis ‚Äì With 7‚Äù display and page turn buttons,4.0,"Ease of download, small size all big pluses","Reviewed in the United States on February 24, 2021",,True,"This is my 3rd kindle. The first was one of the original and it had cellular connection and i sure miss that but otherwise this newer version is smaller and better battery.  My second one i left one time in a hotel (they mailed it back to me) and another time on a flight (they never found it) - so note to all do NOT get a black cover if you are prone to leaving things they blend in too easily with hotel and airplane stuff.On the positive sides for this model - Its very easy to sync it to Amazon, download books, remove books and store them away in folders.  Also battery is pretty good - not timed it but probably getting 8 hours.  Cover has a nice feel to it, wish it was way brighter blue.  Mostly i pull down books from kindle unlimited and then put them back, that seems to work fine, though it sometimes is out of sync with what books i have or don't have when looking at that online.On the down side - the touch controls are way, way too sensitive, its constantly!!! turning too many pages or moving the wrong way. Also the UI is terrible, it defaults to selling you stuff and not your library stuff. Finding controls for brightness and text size is multiple steps and not intuitive.",

Keys and typing respond faster for me. I always thought it was poor on Voyage. Why you might ask? It‚Äôs for reading. Because for the amount of money spent typing out notes was not good. Typing notes etc is supported and should have been better and not so laggy and slow on Voyage. I almost didn‚Äôt upgrade since I wasn‚Äôt sure on spending hundreds more on a e-reader and to still see so much lag and slow responses. As I said above it‚Äôs much better (for me) and I really enjoy the bigger screen on the Oasis. Great build, feel, response.I should mention this is actually my second Oasis (10 gen). The first one was purchased from Best Buy and I loved it. But this cost way too much money to have issues on day one. I had a very small dead pixel. Wipe, reset etc did nothing. Best Buy couldn‚Äôt replace it since they didn‚Äôt have the model I have in stock and to my surprise Amazon wanted to send me a refurbished device for a two day old device. I don‚Äôt mind refurbished devices mind you. BUT not for a device that‚Äôs only a day or two old. Amazon should have sent a brand new model since it was so new. Instead, I got a refund on my Oasis and ordered a new one from Amazon. And that‚Äôs what I have now. No dead pixels or issues so far.I expect more from this e-reader because it costs so much more than other models/devices.

It is a little.touchy, some times pages turn when I didnt mean them to. Its tricky to turn off as well. Its says to push and hold top button then a popup screen appears to close screen, but sometimes I'm just holding the button and nothing appears. It is entirely possible that I'm misunderstanding instrucrions.Overall, I'm very pleased.  This is my first Kindle so I can't compare it.to others.  I bought this as I wake up in middle of night and dont like turning on a light to read. This is the perfect solution. Plus it's small enough to put in my purse and take out with me, I dont have a large purse. I bought it with the specials which are advertisements on, it doesnt bother me, besides sometimes I see something that looks interesting and they never pop up when reading only when turning on.  I also didn't spend the extra for the rose gold, which I really liked because I got a.cover to protect it and that covers up the color anyway. Make sure you get the adapter or you'll have to use your computer to.charge, so get the package with cover and adapter and save some cash for books! Also glad I waited for this one as the previous Kindle, reading reviews, had the turn on off button on the bottom which apparently would turn off while reading if you rest it on your body while reading. It's also fairly light to hold with one hand to read.So overall, I definately recommend. I'm confident I'll get many years of enjoyment.",One person found this helpful
Kindle Oasis ‚Äì With 7‚Äù display and page turn buttons,2.0,An upgrade designed for profit margin rather than readers,"Reviewed in the United States üá∫üá∏ on June 6, 2022",Digital Storage Capacity: 8 GB | Offer Type: Lockscreen Ad-Supported | Color: Graphite | Option: Without Kindle Unlimited,True,"The 2022 Kindle Oasis is a strange beast. If you are a Kindle newbie, your socks are going to be blown off because you won't know the wonders of Kindle. However, for someone like me who has had several iterations of Kindle (Kindle 2, Kindle Keyboard, Kindle 4, Kindle Fire, Kindle Paperwhite 2015), I can say this is a bizarre upgrade offering. The price is sky high and as a fan of Kindle, I have been drooling over the idea of upgrading my 2015 Paperwhite to an Oasis since it came out. Well I finally decided to do it when it was heavily discounted with a trade in. Even after trade in of a 2015 Paperwhite, it was an additional $200 out of pocket. That's more than I've ever paid for a Kindle outright.It took just a few hours to realize that 2022 Kindle Oasis is not a device inspired by Kindle enthusiasts but rather a device from the minds of Amazon bean counters on how to boost profit margins on Kindle sales. The Oasis is full of features that no one asked for. It's much wider than any other Kindlemto accommodate the bigger screen and the devoted page turn buttons. This makes no sense since K4 had buttons neatly integrated into the side of the body and the current 2022 Paperwhite has a bigger, sharper screen simply by shrinking the bezels.The Oasis also has a strange physical profile that's not symmetrical that I couldn't really get used to. I mean I could if I had to but it did not strike me as a $200 upgrade as it is unbalanced and much more deliberate in trying to handle than the K4 or 2015 PW. The sharper screen, waterproofing, and additional warm LEDs were an upgrade over my 2015 Paperwhite but things I could get on a much, much more economical upgrade to the 2022 Paperwhite. The Oasis also has an premium with its aluminum chassis yet a fragile feel that I absolutely don't want in a Kindle. The beauty of Kindle has always been that I can take it, throw it in a (big) pocket, abuse it, and not lose sleep if I lose it or break it because it's not an iPad. Oasis totally misses this point. With its wide, thin frame it feels easy to bend and/or shatter with a drop. And seriously, micro USB (rather than USB-C) and ads on a device at this price point??I promptly returned the Oasis. It's nice if money is no object for those who don't have a background with Kindle, but for the rest of us, seems like nothing more than a reason to increase profit margin on Kindle sales.",3 people found this helpful

Finally I decided to pull the trigger and bought this version of the kindle oasis and admit I'm disappointed.  The storage is great, screen is good but I hate the case that came with the bundle and the buttons are not comfortable like they were back in the kindle keyboard days. The case is rouch and if you use a finger to support the bottom it feels like it starts to give you a callus and the placement of the buttons just isn't natural if you have small hands. It's also wide and less comfortable to hold if you have small hands. The kindle works as a kindle should but I don't think it's worth the price, I wish I had gone with one of their other versions.",
Kindle Oasis ‚Äì With 7‚Äù display and page turn buttons,3.0,"Two Steps Forward, One Step Back for the 10th Gen Oasis","Reviewed in the United States üá∫üá∏ on August 15, 2019",Digital Storage Capacity: 8 GB | Offer Type: Lockscreen Ad-Supported | Color: Graphite | Option: Without Kindle Unlimited,True,"This is the fourth Kindle I have owned over the past five years or so. Oddly enough, certain features that were standard on the Kindles (i.e. page turning buttons) were consequently removed and in later renditions brought back again as an ""enhanced feature"" on the premium priced Oasis and Voyager.I have owned each rendition of the Oasis and have noticed with each iteration its always a step forward and a step backward at the same time. For the first Oasis, I loved the extremely thin design (which made holding the device in one hand quite doable), the charging case was a very clever addition, the page turning buttons were a welcome returned feature, and the device itself was snappy. The Oasis 2 brought a larger 7"" display which is beautiful, but with that the device became more unwieldy to hold in one hand as it became significantly heavier, and that was compounded by the slippery metal design.With the Oasis 3, the warm setting has been a welcome feature but not quite enough for those who owned the Oasis 2 to consider upgrading. In a way it is essentially darkening the display unless you really ramp up the backlight to compensate for it. My biggest gripe with the device is that it is exactly the same weight and measurements as the Oasis 2017, but inexplicably they moved the magnets to a different spot on the device so the Awake/Sleep function does not work unless you buy a new case (or an expensive $60 Amazon leather case). My other problem is this is a $250 reading device that still charges another $20 dollars for advertisements (""special offers""). There is really no excuse at this price point to further gouge the customer when that should already be removed when making such an expensive premium purchase for an E-Reader.The Oasis 3 is a great device and Amazon's premium E-Reader, but the upgrade is not significant enough to warrant purchasing over the Oasis 2 (the only significant change is really the warm lighting but that to me has not been that big of a game changer) and the movement of the magnets / still putting advertisements on this premium device are frustrating and baffling decisions. I also don't find the device particularly comfortable to hold with the metal design and the weight shifted to one side (as said earlier, the Oasis 1 did this well because it was much lighter). I will say the screen is absolutely beautiful and unrivaled. Most people would probably be better off getting the Oasis 2 at a discounted price online now that the Oasis 3 is out and they want that extra inch of display (and if you don't care about that, go with the Oasis 1 which is very reasonably priced and is the lightest Kindle Amazon has ever made).",23 people found this helpful
Kindle Oasis ‚Äì With 7‚Äù display and page turn buttons,5.0,Worthwhile Upgrade,"Reviewed in the United States üá∫üá∏ on August 23, 2019",Digital Storage Capacity: 8 GB | Offer Type: Lockscreen Ad-Supported | Color: Graphite | Option: Without Kindle Unlimited,True,"I debated for quite a while on upgrading from the Paperwhite 3 to this because of the price point. I LOVED my paperwhite 3 but really wanted an e-reader with a larger screen. Boy am I SO glad I took the leap. Once all my books downloaded and finally finished indexing, the battery life greatly improved. I don't believe I will get the 5+ weeks that my paperwhite 3 got, but the other improvements in this device make the *slightly* shorter battery life worth it (after all, with improved features, battery life will be affected). The improvements that I love include the following:1) extremely quick charging (LOADS faster than my paperwhite 3 probably within 2 to 3 hours)2) the operating system is WAY more responsive. It was unreal how quickly books would download on this versus the paperwhite 3. Page turning is also loads quicker.3) highlight feature and dictionary look are also way more responsive.4) Deeper sleep mode if the device hasn't been used in a few hours (which I really like)5) Page turn buttons. I NEVER thought I would like or need the page turn buttons as much as I do. I don't know how I went without them before!6) Warm light is freaking awesome also.7) Larger screen is amazing. It's more crisp and clear and it's SO nice to have more text on a ""page""8) More memoryThe auto-adjustable brightness is a cool feature, but I haven't really used it much. I don't plan too. I keep the lighting on 6, 7 or 8 when I'm in bed and the warm light on 8 at the same time also. With auto-adjust on, the light was at 11. Too bright for a dark room. I also don't use the light or the warm light during the day.Overall, I'm SO happy with this upgrade. It is leaps and bounds above the Paperwhite 3.

It is super slick which makes the kindle slip out of your hand. The metal frame is also chilly. I did buy the Amazon case for the kindle but it did not improve the reading experience. The kindle was just as difficult to hold, now because of the increased weight from the case. The case also doesn‚Äôt conform to the hand grip portion of the oasis. I searched for hours trying to find something that would increase the grip so I could read while lying down. Nothing.

Kindle Oasis ‚Äì With 7‚Äù display and page turn buttons,3.0,You would think for the price they could have improved the operating system...,"Reviewed in the United States üá∫üá∏ on April 20, 2022",Digital Storage Capacity: 32 GB | Offer Type: Lockscreen Ad-Supported | Color: Graphite | Option: Without Kindle Unlimited,True,"Had this for a few days now, using it a lot more than I thought I would. Biggest issue for me so far is whatever operating system this thing is running on. I have a much older model that I bought for maybe $100 back in 2017 that I found to be too dark and slow. I was hoping the upgrade to the newest Oasis would help with the speed, but this thing still feels like using a computer from the 90s. You have an extremely unresponsive touchscreen (as sleek as it may feel), poor range of customization options, and very lackluster QoL features all around, all of which are more than likely due to the age of the operating system. I've gotten errors several times now completely closing me out of my book or restarting/updating my kindle entirely. And these were products I had purchased directly from the Kindle store so there should be no errors. The only reason it does not get a lower rating for me is because I am enjoying it and with the side buttons it does what you need it to do most of the time. I'm sure there must be a better e-reader than this on the market for the price point.

Kindle Oasis ‚Äì With 7‚Äù display and page turn buttons,1.0,Sorely disappointed with grip and battery life,"Reviewed in the United States üá∫üá∏ on August 13, 2019",Digital Storage Capacity: 8 GB | Offer Type: Lockscreen Ad-Supported | Color: Graphite | Option: Without Kindle Unlimited,True,"This is my fourth or fifth Kindle. I took advantage of the Prime Day 2019 sale plus buy back to get the Oasis at an affordable price. The Kindle I sold back to Amazon was a first or second generation Kindle Voyage. I was tremendously excited about the grip on the Oasis because it was something that I felt the Voyage needed. I was also excited about it being waterproof; this feature would allow me to take it to the public pool without worry.  I had expected that there would be a suitable Amazon cover for it but I can't seem to find one that would allow me to read the way that I generally read.Here were my problems:1. The screen and item are much smaller than I expected. No, I did not read and measure out the dimensions but every Kindle I have had has had about the same size area for reading. Not the Oasis. To get the same feel, I have to turn it sideways but your options are to either have it sideways or up and down which leads me to ...2. The screen orientation does not change automatically like a phone. You either have to set portrait or landscape. It will then automatically flip 180 degrees in that orientation. I understand why they would choose to do it this way but a better option would be to have a quick to reach toggle that makes it stick. Right now I have to do five presses to switch between portrait and landscape. If I read in bed and need the grip, I have to change it to portrait mode. At the gym, I have to change it to landscape (it's much more stable on the cardio machine holds with the grip toward the ground; otherwise the grip slants it).3. I don't know if I got a bad one but battery life sucks even without use. I have it in airplane mode 99% of the time (which means Bluetooth is turned off) and the light setting is at 11. I used to get approximately 3 weeks of life out of the Voyage. I am not getting a week out of the Oasis and I have been using it significantly less than previous months (it's been a slow reading month).4. The thing is so small and thin that the grip doesn't do much to make it easy to hold. The first problem I had was that holding it on such a way that I could somewhat use the grip made the buttons on the thing awkward to reach. Thankfully they do have the option of reversing the buttons.5. The power button is way too sensitive. I tried using this at the gym initially in portrait made. I naturally hold this thing in my left hand so I placed it on the machine shelf with the buttons and grip toward the left. This means the power button is on the bottom. Just placing it on the shelf turned it off. I had to flip it around. Okay, I thought, stupid me. Nope, I constantly turn this thing off and on just handling it6. Which brings me to, why is this thing so slow to turn on? When I've actually wanted to turn it on (until I realized that it was just super slow), I ended up turning it off again because I pressed the button again thinking I didn't get it the first time. The Voyage was practically immediate for me between button press and the screen requesting a swipe.I have nothing nice to say about it other than all the other nice things I'd say about any Kindle. I have loved my previous Kindles though each one (of course) could use improvements. Amazon is good about improving the Kindles but this one was a fail for me.I have two days to return this thing and I am not sure what I am going to do. Am I going to return to get another Kindle Voyage? I only got $50 for my Voyage but there's no way to get it back. Perhaps I have a defective one and I should get an exchange, specifically I think the battery is problematic on my device.",135 people found this helpful
Kindle Oasis ‚Äì With 7‚Äù display and page turn buttons,1.0,Not really what I expected,"Reviewed in the United States üá∫üá∏ on January 24, 2021",Digital Storage Capacity: 8 GB | Offer Type: Lockscreen Ad-Supported | Color: Graphite | Option: Without Kindle Unlimited,True,"Second update- I officially HATE this Kindle. Decided I would trade it in to get a different model and can I trade it in? No, I cannot.  What a ridiculous joke that they won't accept their newest model to trade in.  I shouldn't have given it the benefit of the doubt, should have just returned it when I was initially displeased & gotten a different model.  The battery is trash (I have to charge it every few days), I still have the bleed-through issue with the text... it's just really poorly made.Updated: I've had this Kindle a few months now & I have to say that for the first time as a Kindle owner, I don't love it.  I will likely turn this one in for a different model in the next few months.  The bleed through problem has returned (see photo).  I can see the home screen, through the text of the book I am reading. It's VERY distracting. I have to reset the system each time to make it go away.  I sent the first one back because of this issue & while it took a little while for this one to do it as well, it does it regularly now.  Obviously it's some sort of glitch in the Kindle Oasis system, but it's a big step back as far as Kindle screens & functionality go. I would not recommend the Oasis.Prior review:I've been a Kindle user since their first release in 2007.  Over the years, I've gone through 4 different Kindle varieties- the original, the Paperwhite, then the Voyage (my favorite of the bunch) & now the Oasis.  I had my Voyage for 5 years & I loved it every single time I picked it up to use it.  Lately though, I had to charge it at least once per week, and it was starting to reboot itself for no good reason periodically.  It was clear it was on its last leg.  I was deciding between the Paperwhite & the Oasis but I really really like page turn buttons. I prefer the size of the Paperwhite for sure, but the better lighting & the buttons, as well as the impressive battery longevity were the selling points for me.Well, the buttons are terrific & I love the way the device feels in my hand- it's certainly the most comfortable Kindle to read from that I've owned.  I think the lighting is grand & I really love how evenly distributed it is across the entire page BUT, at least every few days there is some glitch so that when I enter the book, the main home screen, with the book covers displayed, bleeds through the e-ink & I can see it as a shadow behind the words I'm trying to read. it's very very distracting and requires a reboot of the Kindle to make it temporarily go away until it reappears in a few days again. VERY annoying.  I called Amazon, they did nothing about it.  Worse however- this batter is no better than the Paperwhite I just got rid of.  I have had it about 2 weeks & have charged it 3 times already.  For reference, I read about a half hour or an hour per day & leave it in airplane mode unless I am actively downloading a new book which happens about once per week.  The battery should NOT be draining this quickly. Again, Amazon did not seem to care when I called them about it.So, as much as I enjoy this, I'm probably going to return it in favor of the smaller Paperwhite because I didn't spend this much money for a device that does not live up to any of my actual expectations.  What a shame.",7 people found this helpful

Personally I like the ""lump"" on the side under the page turning buttons, as it gives me a nice place to hold it. The touch screen isn't great, but it's not a phone, so I figured I'd survive.Then it seemed like the touch screen got worse by the day. The already dismal keyboard is now barely functional. Attempts to highlight a word within a book and access the Wikipedia entry (I'm a very curious person, I do this a lot when I'm reading) used to work every time, now it works maybe once every fifty times. The layout of the Kindle store has changed so many times I just shrug when I see what comes up now. I have no idea where things go when they're added to my library because I sure can't find them.The battery life was never spectacular for me but I have always kept the wifi on so that I could look up words on Wikipedia when I needed to. It hasn't gotten any worse since I got it, but I never got anything close to several days. I do read a lot though.Bottom line - it's ok, but for something they're charging this much for it should deliver a better experience.",
Kindle Oasis ‚Äì With 7‚Äù display and page turn buttons,4.0,Great Reader but Limited function for Purchases & Organizing,"Reviewed in the United States on August 11, 2020",Digital Storage Capacity: 8 GB | Offer Type: Lockscreen Ad-Supported | Color: Graphite | Option: Without Kindle Unlimited,True,I love using my Kindle oasis. It‚Äôs lightweight and very convenient to read using the hand strap while laying down.  The screen is easy on the eyes and much less fatiguing than using the Kindle app with my phone.The things I don‚Äôt like is it is virtually useless for purchasing.  Organizing my collections is also quite difficult. The touchscreen can be a little sensitive and changes pages Unintentionally. Using the dictionary and x-ray is much simpler with the Kindle app and the iPhone. I find I end up purchasing my books using my phone and loading them into the collection from there. Of course since Amazon doesn‚Äôt recognize the iPhone I have to login to Amazon and do my purchases from Google Chrome.  The Amazon app will not load content into an iPhone.I understand battery life is a trade off with processing power and this device is high on battery life but definitely short on processing power. It would be nice if the Kindle worked just like the Kindle app on the phone which is a very well-designed interface. I don‚Äôt need a full browser but the kindle needs a full function app that lets you search for content on the Kindle store would be great.A device mirror app for the phone and PC for organizing books and collections would also be very helpful.Also a hard button or switch to turn on and off the Wi-Fi would simplify the ability to extend battery life.,2 people found this helpful
Kindle Oasis ‚Äì With 7‚Äù display and page turn buttons,1.0,Very Dissapointing,"Reviewed in the United States on July 30, 2019",Digital Storage Capacity: 8 GB | Offer Type: Lockscreen Ad-Supported | Color: Graphite | Option: Without Kindle Unlimited,True,"My Kindle Voyage was damaged ‚òπ. I was absolutely happy üòäwith that device and I tried purchasing a new Voyage only to find it not available anymore. I am now the not so happy owner of the Kindle Oasis 10th generation. Please note all my remarks are made as a comparison to the Kindle Voyage. The Oasis is a fine e-reader but in my personal opinion it falls short to the Voyage.LOOKS:The machine looks marvelous with a sleek metal back side. Wow! It is so sleek that you cannot put it down on an even slightly inclined surface (like a plastic or wooden chair) because it will slip right off. If it is placed on a table, put it in the middle because a small touch will send it skidding. The older Voyage has a plastic somewhat rubbery back and will never slip off - and I have used it for almost 5 years never using a cover. Who cares how this things backside looks? Most people put it in a cover anyway. Functionality and usability are all that matters.DISPLAY:I have never noticed the screen dimming or getting brighter using the Voyage, no matter what the circumstances, it always looks the same. With the Oasis when ambient light outside is dimming the display brightness is dimming in noticeable steps. Very annoying and I can only hope a software update will solve this.The Oasis display seems somewhat more reflective although that may be a personal perception. I do not recall seeing any reflections in the Voyage ever.BATTERY LIFE:This was the real surprise, after a couple of books and a couple of days I got a low battery pop up. Seriously? The Voyage just kept going for what seemed like weeks and dozens of books! After recharging to 100% and reading one book it was down again to 60%. Again, I can only hope a software update will solve this beyond believe issue. 20190802 update: battery life is about 8hours of reading . . .  so enormously dissapointing! 20200820 update: plugging in a charger shows green (fully charged) LED while display shows ""low battery"". Now needs unplugging a couple of times before charging starts.WEIGHT:When purchasing I knew the Oasis was slightly heavier than the Voyage. What I did not realize is that is also wider. Force x distance after a while does really make you feel that difference.SPEED:An initial start after putting it down a while takes longer than with the Voyage. If you shut it down and start again after a couple of minutes, it starts normally. Seems weird for a newer version.TOUCH SCREENThe response seems somewhat slow. It is so slow that I doubt it responded, then tap again, only to find that it then skips a page.DIMENSIONSIf you are not carrying a purse, please not that this device will not fit in any pocket in your jeans or jacket. It might fit in an overcoat pocket.ON/OFF BUTTONThe on and off button works to the lightest touch. Contrary to the Voyage that on/off button protrudes. When carrying it in a purse, in this case my wife‚Äôs purse, do not be surprised to find your Oasis activated and on a random page . . .. The people whom designed this obviously never use an e-reader. No software fix for this . . .TIME SETTINGSThe USA is one of the few countries to use am/pm. Most of the world uses a 24-hour system, ‚Äúmilitary time‚Äù as they call this in the USA. Amazon operates worldwide - and yet, there is no setting to allow using 24 hour time. And this did not catch anyone‚Äôs attention, not those whom wrote the program of requirements, not the software designers, not the test users . . . .. This can be fixed with a software update.TO CONCLUDE:First, there seem to be some issues that could be resolved with a software update.Second, dear Amazon, I would not mind if you would replace my Oasis 10th generation 32GB WiFi only ‚Äúno special offers‚Äù with a brand new Voyage that you may have lying around in some corner of your warehouses . . . .SERVICE:None of the above problems have been solved by software updates. Been in contact with service and talked to a rep in South Africa whom was himself flabbergasted with the am/pm vs 24h issue which he couldn't solve.",27 people found this helpful

I have had a few versions of the Paperwhite, the Voyager, and now the Oasis.  I will say, the difference between the Voyager and the Oasis is minimal, however I prefer the ergonomic shape of the Oasis to the standard Kindle/Voyager shape.Bearing in mind that this is a ""luxury"" e-reader, I do feel inclined to recommend it to my fellow book nerds, as the ability to read any book in your electronic library (as long as it is a Mobi formatted file) is extremely convenient.A few issues I've had - the batter life is pretty small, but I attribute this to the excellent lighting features.  That being said, the issue with the shorter battery life, is that the Oasis seems to ""act up"" when the battery level is below 30%.  I'll have delays in page-turning, just for it to then jump forward 5 pages or so in the novel.  It can be quite distracting, and will often lead to me ending my reading session at that time.",

My last two kindles were Paperwhites. I am extremely happy with the Oasis model.  I really like being able to turn pages with the side ""click"" buttons, which I do with my thumb while holding this very light unit.  I can turn the unit and alternate hands - which relieves fatigue. I configured the buttons so the button nearest my thumb is page forward.  The unit automatically flips the screen and the buttons when you turn it over to switch hands.As with the Paperwhite models, the display is fully adjustable for layout, font size, brightness and with the Oasis, warmth.  I love the touch screen off feature, which allows you to hold the unit while you're reading and not inadvertently turn the pages if you accidentally touch the screen.Battery life is excellent. To extend the battery life, I leave the bluetooth off, and when there's enough light I like to turn the kindle light off. The screen looks sharpest to me when I use natural light. I can usually go a week or so without charging and when I do, the unit charges quickly.They say its water-proof (which is how I ruined my last Paperwhite).  When I told my grandson, he wanted me to drop it in the tub to see.  I didn't want to take the risk. :)Reading is my passion, and the kindle Oasis is definitely the best model yet.  Its well worth the extra price for someone who reads a couple hours a day!",

Kindle Oasis ‚Äì With 7‚Äù display and page turn buttons,3.0,I was expecting more,"Reviewed in the United States on February 9, 2021",Digital Storage Capacity: 8 GB | Offer Type: Lockscreen Ad-Supported | Color: Graphite | Option: Without Kindle Unlimited,True,"I bought the Oasis to replace my previous Kindle Voyage, which I used for around 6 years. I was expecting a lot more from a 6 year advancements in technology. Don't get me wrong, it is a good device, and you might like it, but I was expecting a lot more.Let's talk about battery life first. I don't get anywhere close to the weeks the description says it provides. I might get a week out of it. I read an average of 3 hours a day, so I expect most users will get a longer battery life, but my old Voyage used to give me, at least, a couple of weeks with the same use I do now. Granted, I have wifi on all the time, which I also did in the Voyage, I've turned off bluetooth because it is just silly in this device, and I still get 1 week max.The screen is probably the best out there, but not much better than the Voyage. We are talking about 6 years in technology evolution and I can't really tell the difference. I mean, if I put them side by side, yes the Oasis is a bit better, but not 6 years better. Not even $150 better than the current paper-white.Amazon, you sell a premium device and you don't even provide a charger? Come on, this thing is not cheap. I know I have a thousand chargers around the house and I don't need it, but how about updating to USB-C and provide the cable and charger with the device like it should be?I understand that older kindles are updated with the latest software, but even in this aspect the Oasis is a bit lackluster. There's no difference with the software in the Voyage other than some settings related to bluetooth. One thing I can say, the navigation and page refreshes are a lot faster than the Voyage and probably justify the upgrade, but that's about it.I give this product 3 stars because I can't really recommend it. It is a great device, but it costs a lot of money, and most people will be just as happy with a paperwhite that is significantly cheaper.",

But due to some vision issues, my eyes tire easily and I need an eReader with a lot of contrast and other features that make it easier on the eyes and this appears to be the best one out there for that. That said, eReaders still generally do not have adequate levels of contrast for my tastes.  Even with the Kindle Oasis,  I still need to play with the fonts and set everything to all bold.  However, the warmth lighting feature really helps too.  It helps to make reading more comfortable for someone whose eyes tire easily.I also like the fact that you can turn pages either with the buttons or by the touch screen (you can choose which one in the settings).  I prefer the touch screen, but I know that many people like the physical buttons.One thing I am not crazy about is the fact that the screen orientation will not automatically adjust from portrait to landscape, or vice versa, as you move the Kindle.  You can only choose landscape or portrait.  I am used to my Kindle Fire HD 8, which will just automatically shift from one to another.Overall, I am still playing with this device and trying to make it work for me.  But so far it is better for my needs than the lower-level Kindles, or than the Nook Glowlight that I had and sold.",

I've been using a HD 7"" Fire for several years as a Kindle. The Oasis is a huge improvement. It was well worth the $199 Amazon deal of the day! Many of the other review clearly indicates its very many positives. My view of the few negatives I've run into so far include:  . Ads are very distracting! My Fire was able to remove the adware by simple selections in the on-device management area. On the Oasis you need to pay $20 in the management area of your account the Amazon site. In my view paying $20 is well worth it!  . With Ads you get a 5-20 second blank screen delay after password entry. So far the delay seems to have vanished once I paid to remove the ad-ware.  . The sensitivity of the touchscreen seems random in areas on my Oasis. This makes some menus easy to navigate while others very  difficult. This is all due to apparently random sensitivity of different areas on the screen. This may be a defect in my Oasis. I'll see how much of a pain this becomes with my usage.  Overall, I'd buy the device again AND I strongly recommend it especially for the ~$200 price.  And I would rate the Oasis a 4.5 star!",

What I don‚Äôt like is it is heavier and I find it more awkward to hold because it‚Äôs slightly bigger and heavier.  I find that when I press for the next page it sometimes skips multiple pages ahead.  And what I really don‚Äôt like is how the organization for the oasis is different from the paperwhite.

But then they did a software update and I lost my Collections folders but the paperwhite still has them.  That is my biggest dislike.

Kindle Oasis ‚Äì With 7‚Äù display and page turn buttons,2.0,Not worth it for serious readers,"Reviewed in the United States on August 29, 2020",Digital Storage Capacity: 32 GB | Offer Type: Lockscreen Ad-Supported | Color: Champagne Gold | Option: Without Kindle Unlimited,True,"Warning: this will be a long review.  First, I've owned Kindle e-readers since the Kindle keyboard.  I love to read.  I love to re-read my books - isn't that why we buy a device to haul all of our books around?  No more second suitcase for vacations, or bookbags to bring with my purse?  When my Kindle Voyage started to die, I started researching the new Kindles.  The biggest draw to the Oasis for me was the larger storage capapbilities.  No more having ""too many books"" for my Kindle to hold.  The second draw was the battery life- it was one of my favorite things about the Voyage.  My battery would last a week with it (yes, I read a LOT - sometimes my Kindle is on upwards of 15 hours a day).  So, imagine my disappointment when my new Oasis battery lasted 36 hours.  Ok,  I get it - I was downloading books and collections.  It takes a lot of battery.  But I am not so new to Kindle that I didn't already have the screen turned down and airplane mode on when not downloading.  It didn't matter - 36 hours.  After doing 2 factory resets with the aid of Kindle support (come on, I just want to read my books, not continuously reset my device and have to re-download everything), they finally decided the best thing to do was to send me a new one.  Maybe my first was a fluke..  No.  36 hours.  Amazon offered to replace it again.  I said no - if the battery is supposed to last 3 weeks (what I was told by the rep) and I read a lot, it should still be lasting a week!  So with the help of Jessica H (this girl is a gem - you guys need to give her a raise!), the downloaded my ""logs"" to the tech team.  When the tech team couldn't figure anything out, they had me manually download the logs and email them in.  Then I did a factory reset.  Then they had me let my Oasis completely deplete, wait for 2 minutes before plugging it in and recharging it, and then logging the battery constantly for the next 24+ hours.  Oh - but in the meantime the techs came back with the brilliant reasoning that the reason my battery wasn't lasting was that I had TOO MANY books downloaded to my device!  WTH?!  I had just gotten it and done factory restarts on it - there are less than 200 books on there!  And wait - wasn't that the whole point to having 32 GB of memory - so I COULD have my books on my device????  At the end of the call back, the only option they had for me was to once again replace a $260 device that had already failed TWICE.  Why?  Because my original purchase was 70 days ago, so I was beyond the return period.  Luckily Jessica H (seriously - wonderful, helpful, and always called when she said she would) spent THREE HOURS to get an exception to allow the return.  I will go out of Amazon and buy a replacement battery for my Voyage.  If I replace my Voyage again, it will be with a basic $99 Kindle - because I know what to expect from that - and not have high hopes that I had with the Oasis.",

In December of 2019, i bought an entry level Kindle to see if I liked it. It was a great product but I didn‚Äôt like how it was hard to hold, the lighting seemed cheap and the screen looked pixelated. However, it was a good product and I wanted to get a better version of the Kindle and did my research on the Oasis. The Kindle Oasis is a far better machine and would recommend this to anyone that is serious about reading or just enjoys reading in general. I have been reading a lot and find that the Kindle Oasis is very easy to use, and the touch screen is far better than the entry level. The lighting is fantastic (I was not a believer in the warmth light, but it makes a HUGE difference). The page buttons are very good as well, and eliminates the need to touch the screen, which I found hard on the entry level because it would not turn correctly to the next page. The beveled edge makes for more ease of use when reading as well. It is far more comfortable to hold in your hand than the other version. And lastly, the pixels/screen. The difference in pixels between the Oasis and the entry level is drastically better. When reading it feels like you are actually reading off a physical page of a book, it is that good. The screen being bigger also makes the experience better and definitely makes reading very enjoyable.All in all, if you are contemplating purchasing this product, just do it. I have been reading more after getting this and definitely enjoying it very much. Definitely a must have if your an avid book reader.",One person found this helpful
Kindle Oasis ‚Äì With 7‚Äù display and page turn buttons,5.0,Love the Oasis,"Reviewed in the United States on August 2, 2019",Digital Storage Capacity: 8 GB | Offer Type: Lockscreen Ad-Supported | Color: Graphite | Option: Without Kindle Unlimited,True,"Got it today and upgraded from the Voyage, which I was happy with. Did a bunch of research when the Voyage came out and compared to then Oasis 1 (or 2), I ended buying the Voyage cause of price, and I wasn‚Äôt keen on the weird shape of the Oasis.Fast forward to today, traded Voyage in cause of the rebate and the 25% off purchase of another Kindle, which knocked the price down from splurge level to someone palatable.First impressions, the notch in the back totally changes the way you hold a Kindle. With previous versions I ended up with my pinky on the bottom as a kind of stabilizer while rest of my hand is on the side. With the Oasis, due to weight and the notch, I now hold it as a regular book with no pinky needed to stabilize.The warmth lighting is awesome and prevents eye fatigue reading in the dark. I thought Voyage was fine but this in another level, especially for us more ‚Äúmature‚Äù eyed readers.Can‚Äôt comment much on battery as I‚Äôm still i first cycle but gave it a 4 will probably update as I get more use.Overall I‚Äôm happy with purchase.Update on battery life: Seems good to me. I have brightness on 22, warmth at 23, auto-brightness on, airplane mode usually on (I turn it off to sync after I‚Äôm done reading then turn it back on after).  Page refresh is off. I read about an hour a day before I sleep, last charged it 5 days ago and I‚Äôm currently at 70% still. Not quite sure how some people are getting only a few hours of battery life? Must have every feature turned on, combined with lots of browsing, downloading, reading? I guess it‚Äôs user usage dependent, for me battery life is what I‚Äôve seen and expected  from prior Kindles, paperwhite, Voyage, etc.",3 people found this helpful
Kindle Oasis ‚Äì With 7‚Äù display and page turn buttons,5.0,It's about time!,"Reviewed in the United States on August 8, 2019",Digital Storage Capacity: 8 GB | Offer Type: Lockscreen Ad-Supported | Color: Graphite | Option: Without Kindle Unlimited,True,"For quite some time I had been wondering when Amazon was going to catch up to other ereaders and offer a Kindle with warm light. Although I think the wait was far too long, I must admit that I am quite happy with the result. Reading on a Kindle is a joy again. After reading on a different ereader with warm light, I found the blue-white light of my old Paperwhite annoying. I had all but stopped using it, so it was an easy decision to trade it in for a discount on and a $25 gift card towards this Oasis.One of my two biggest complaints is having to manually download my library. My other ereader knew what books I have active and which I have stored, so when I was setting it up it automatically downloaded the active books. This is a feature the Kindles sorely needs. If I could, I would remove half a star from my rating for this. The other complaint was the initial battery life. I knew getting things set up would drain the battery. What I didn't expect was the amount of battery usage while I thought it was in sleep mode. I was very close to returning the thing. However, after a couple of days, I realized the case was not putting the Oasis into sleep mode when closed. Now I manually put it sleep and wake it up. Eventually, I will get a case that does this, but it is not a high priority. I read a lot (over 200 books so far this year), but since I figured out what was causing the battery to drain, I've only had to recharge once in twelve days. This is in line with how often I had to recharge my old Paperwhite when I was reading on it a lot.All-in-all, I have thrilled with the Oasis and look forward to years of happy reading.",3 people found this helpful

Been busy every since playing around adjusting settings and so forth.I really like how I can switch holding my Oasis from my right hand to my left hand and the screen automatically adjusts.  I have reassigned the Page Turn buttons so the Bottom Button moves the pages forward.  The screen is so clear and very easy to read (love those extra lights).I am still getting use to the Warmth settings and the Brightness settings.  Having fun picking a Font and a Bold/Size settings.  I have saved one Theme setting already.Amazon makes it so easy to set up.  I was off and running and immediately began reading James Bond in ""Never Dream of Dying"".  A book that was on my Paperwhite and switched over to my Oasis with no problem.  Even read a graphic novel (a little easier on a 7in screen than a 6in screen).  First new Kindle in over 3 years.  Very light and I am having no problems holding it and reading on it.Updated to reflect my new Charcoal Fintie Origami Case .  Feels great, protects my Oasis and fits like a glove.  The Oasis and my Origami cover look and work great together.I get one book a month from the KOLL program, books from Prime, books I buy, or from my digital library.",
Kindle Oasis ‚Äì With 7‚Äù display and page turn buttons,4.0,Expensive but solid,"Reviewed in the United States on July 31, 2019",Digital Storage Capacity: 32 GB | Offer Type: Lockscreen Ad-Supported | Color: Graphite | Option: Without Kindle Unlimited,True,"My old Voyage was starting to have trouble with the page turn buttons not working and bouncing around like crazy so it was time to start looking. I love the page turn buttons and that was a must. The idea of having your thumb on the screen where you are trying to read doesn‚Äôt make sense to me. Anyway, the only option is this new Oasis which is just stupid expensive. I was considering buying a refurbished, older model when Amazon offered 25% off and gave me $50 trade-in on my old Kindle. It made the price actually less than the older version refurbished.I am definitely impressed with the page turn buttons. I like that it‚Äôs an actual button. There‚Äôs no wondering if you have your thumb too far up or down, did I just turn a page back when I meant to go forward type of thing. The response when you touch is great.At first I was pretty bummed because the page forward button was on the top. This isn‚Äôt how I hold my Kindle and I had to stretch to reach. I was very excited to discover that one of the settings lets you reverse this so that the page forward is on the bottom. And it stays on the bottom even when you rotate and hold it in your other hand.I‚Äôve had no issues with screen quality or battery life. It seems well made as it should for the ridiculous price. I can‚Äôt be the only one who thought the prices on these would go down as Amazon realized the  true revenue comes from the purchase of Kindle books. But alas, I‚Äôm on my fourth Kindle and not going anywhere and I guess they know that.",14 people found this helpful

Mostly out of pure stubbornness.  I love my books.  I love the smell, the feel, everything.  All you bibliophiles know what I'm talking about.  I've bought a few e-books over the years and used the app to read them on my pad or phone and figured that would be near the same experience as an actual dedicated e-reader.  It's not.  I love my new Oasis.  When I finally decided to take the plunge, I debated between the Paperwhite and the Oasis.  I was worried the Oasis would feel unbalanced because of the ""ledge"" running down the side where the page turn buttons are, but that's not the case at all.  I love the feel of it.  Very comfortable to hold.As for viewing, although I still love my physical books, this is so darn convenient, comfortable to hold and look at that I find myself a convert.  Looking at the screen is so close to reading an actual book.  Adjustable lighting, fonts and font sizes make it about as close to reading a real book as to be negligible.Being able to go to Kindle store and immediately have any book I want delivered immediately is awesome.  I take it with me everywhere and love knowing all my favorites are right in my purse whenever I want them.  Getting a little older, I find myself grabbing for my Oasis rather than a regular book because it's so easy to hold and see.  And reading at night?  An absolute pleasure now!

Seems to cause me less eye fatigue than iPhone or kindle fire 8.Sufficient battery life for anything I‚Äôve done with it.The kindle app is great and syncing between devices generally works very well (I‚Äôve had issues syncing audible books to text books).The bad:Using the touch screen is terrible. It often doesn‚Äôt register where I want it to, and it is very slow to respond. Compared to my (cheaper) kindle fire 8, the oasis seems to do every user interaction much slower.Holding the device for a long time makes my wrist tired. Not as bad as the kindle fire though.It‚Äôs unfortunate that it doesn‚Äôt reproduce color.When you turn it on, the Home Screen only shows a few of your recently viewed books, but mostly shows books you might want to buy, which is annoying.Overall:After getting this I never use my kindle fire 8 for reading.Sometimes I read using the kindle app on my iPhone though because it sits more balanced in my hand.I think this device and the kindle ecosystem  makes me more apt to spend time reading because it makes interacting with my whole library seamless. Especially as someone who has been on the road a lot, a well organized digital library is far more convenient than physical.",
Kindle Oasis ‚Äì With 7‚Äù display and page turn buttons,5.0,"Great reader, no longer glitchy","Reviewed in the United States on August 2, 2020",Digital Storage Capacity: 8 GB | Offer Type: Lockscreen Ad-Supported | Color: Graphite | Option: Without Kindle Unlimited,True,"This is a great e-reader, insofar as it goes. I love the larger screen. I've even grown to love the page-turn buttons. But. My two biggest complaints are that the battery doesn't last more than a week, and that's with minimal (an hour a day) use. I am not using it for Audible books, this is only for e-books. But compared to my Paperwhite, the battery life is shockingly short. The other, bigger issue is that the reader cuts off while you're reading it. Goes to sleep, as if you've abandoned it for 5 minutes when in actuality you just turned the page.  This happens numerous times if you are reading for as long as an hour. It's haphazard, and it seems the reader doesn't recognize the page turn buttons either, b/c if you use them exclusively, it goes to sleep even more often.  There's no option to control how long the reader waits before it goes to sleep. The random cutting off is annoying, and enough to drive me back to my Paperwhite. This would be a nice reader if they would fix that one problem - I could live with the battery life, I get it, it's a larger screen, blah blah. But fix this problem, Amazon. This reader isn't worth $250.UPDATE: Amazon seems to have fixed the glitches, and the battery life problem, I discovered, was due to a faulty cover that didn‚Äôt close properly. When I changed covers, the issue went away. I now love the Oasis so much that I bought a second one. Five stars!",
Kindle Oasis ‚Äì With 7‚Äù display and page turn buttons,3.0,Kindle Oasis is Better Than Nothing,"Reviewed in the United States on March 28, 2021",Digital Storage Capacity: 8 GB | Offer Type: Lockscreen Ad-Supported | Color: Graphite | Option: Without Kindle Unlimited,True,"The Oasis is better than nothing but a far cry from the Kindle Generation 3!  This Kindle Oasis is not user friendly. It was hard to find the book I was reading when my Original Kindle 3rd Generation died after 10 years.  Kindle does not offer the Kindle Generation 3 and you cannot find repair shops or I never would have had to get the Oasis.  The only reason I got the Oasis over the Paperwhite was that it had buttons to turn the pages rather than accidently touching the screen and have pages flash by and loose your place every few minutes.The Kindle Oasis does not show your library like the Kindle 3rd Gen. You have to guess where to find the book you were reading.  It showed the cover of books but you couldn't read the titles so it was a turkey shoot whether you found your book or not.  Another thing, it is very hard on the eyes with the backlight dimming and brightening every few minutes.The Kindle 3rd Generation would hold a battery charge for about 4 weeks if the internet was turned off.  I only turned it on to shop.  It also had 3G connectivity so if you weren't somewhere that had WI Fi you still could connect and shop in the Kindle Store.  Since I cannot turn off the internet or the backlight on the Oasis, the battery life will probably be maybe a week.I don't expect this Kindle Oasis reader will last as long as my Kindle Generation 3 but hopefully long enough for Amazon to rethink their design decisions and put out a better reader.You know ""If it ain't broke, don't fix it"".  Bring back the Kindle 3rd Generation,  the only thing it does not have is a backlight which they could easily add.  If they brought back the Kindle 3rd Generation Amazon would have a premium product and nobody could touch them in sales.",2 people found this helpful

New to e_reading too, tried a few books on my iPad Air but wanted something with better battery life, lighter and the iPad was being used elsewhere. I did a lot of research and decided I wanted 300PPI display and liked the idea of LEDs (and color control). The decision was to buy an iPad Mini or this most expensive Kindle, I wasn‚Äôt looking at spending less. Hence the Oasis fit the bill with the larger than Paper White display but 300PPI. I have to say I LOVE the buttons to change pages. Can‚Äôt imagine swiping since I only get one page at a time and read it fairly fast. The unit is super light and I don‚Äôt really care it doesn‚Äôt fit in a pocket, it‚Äôs 99% sitting at my bedside for reading at night. I can now see why people I asked usually said ‚ÄúI love my Kindle‚Äù. As a new user to this product, I guess I‚Äôm going to be spoiled with the top of the line but I actually got it free using most of my Amazon Prime points. So if you‚Äôre new to the Kindle line and don‚Äôt mind paying quite a bit more for the Oasis, I highly recommend it and the entire Kindle experience. Yeah, the ad‚Äôs are a tad annoying but one swipe (buttons don‚Äôt work), it‚Äôs gone. The screen is far superior IMHO for reading books than the iPad. I love how I can set the font, size and color so I find I can read longer at night than either old fashion book or iPad. For that alone, I think the Oasis is worth the extra money.",
Kindle Oasis ‚Äì With 7‚Äù display and page turn buttons,5.0,"Happy, even after switching from the Kindle Voyage","Reviewed in the United States on November 30, 2020",Digital Storage Capacity: 8 GB | Offer Type: Lockscreen Ad-Supported | Color: Graphite | Option: Without Kindle Unlimited,True,"I have seen reviews online stating people regretted giving up their Kindle Voyage for the Oasis. I recently made that switch and have 0 regrets. I absolutely loved my Voyage (and still own it). However I love the Oasis even more. It is of similar weight, but has the bigger screen. With a cover (I got the Ayotu Skin Touch and love it), the Oasis is actually more comfortable to hold. Now that I tried the amber light, I'm not sure I could go back to the blue-white screen. Speaking of screens, I noticed no loss of crispness in font between the 2. I also love the switch from the page turn sensor into actual buttons for page turns. I didn't use the feature on my Voyage because they weren't well aligned with my thumb while holding it (so I used the touch screen to turn the page). There are only 2 ways in which the Oasis is not better than the Voyage. My Voyage held a battery charge that would flabbergast even the Energizer bunny. I mean, it's unnatural how long the Voyage can go (in Airplane mode) before needing a recharge. The Oasis holds a charge pretty well in airplane mode too, but nothing like the Voyage. The Voyage also has the 6"" screen instead of the 7"", so can tuck more easily into a pocket. Overall, both are great Kindles, but I am very happy I took a chance on the Oasis (10th generation).",3 people found this helpful
Kindle Oasis ‚Äì With 7‚Äù display and page turn buttons,5.0,"An upgrade from the Voyage, if you don't mind the extra width","Reviewed in the United States on August 17, 2020",Digital Storage Capacity: 8 GB | Offer Type: Lockscreen Ad-Supported | Color: Graphite | Option: Without Kindle Unlimited,True,"The screen on my Kindle Voyage still has the best contrast of any e-reader I've ever used, but the Oasis is close enough that you can't really tell the difference unless you lay them side-by-side. The Oasis wins because it has both dark mode and the adjustable warm light. I also like the physical page turn buttons. I had to disable the touch-sensitive buttons on the Voyage because I was always tapping them accidentally. The Oasis buttons require some pressure, and it makes all the difference. The device is also snappier when navigating on-screen menus.However, be aware that the Oasis is too wide to fit into the pocket of a pair of jeans, unlike all the other Kindle e-readers. So if that's important to you, I'd recommend waiting for Amazon to release a regular sized Kindle with a warm light (the most recent ones already have dark mode).The Oasis also benefits from a case a lot more than the other Kindle e-readers, because the back is metal instead of grippy rubber or plastic. I guess the metal makes it feel more premium, but I find it slippery.Overall, I feel like this is an upgrade from the Voyage. As get older, I increasingly appreciate a comfortable reading experience, and the Oasis delivers. They're not cheap, but I was able to take advantage of one of Amazon's competitive trade-in deals. They took back an old Kindle for more than I would have been able to sell it for, plus I got 20% off this one.",

I was able to buy the books I wanted straight from the kindle, or put pdf's which I wanted to read straight from my PC onto it. At one point however, the kindle no longer could be detected by my PC and in fact, stopped showing many of the files that I had loaded onto it as if they had never been there! That's right, the kindle itself showed some kind of arbitrary preference in the content it would let me read that I had loaded onto it. I scowered the internet and spent hours troubleshooting this issue (mainly just the inability of my computer to detect it) and saw that many other people were experiencing the same thing. Absolutely nothing has worked, and I've tried literally everything. I suppose now Amazon with it's huge corporate structure doesn't care for fixing this issue, but I'm very disappointed in the product now.

Don't get me started on Amazon Music.  They can sell other's products but have no idea how to produce their own.",

The Oasis fits surprisingly comfortable in my hand. As a skeptic of the design and appearance, I have to admit that Amazon nailed it! The ability to switch the page turn buttons was one of the first things I did. However, now that I am more comfortable with it I find that it fits in my hand so well that I will likely be switching them back. The screen size is fantastic, I am turning pages less often and it is so light weight! I was super attached to my kindle voyage for so many reasons, and I was almost not going to trade it in, but I found myself reaching for my oasis over my voyage everytime. Even when I would read on my voyage (because I did force myself to go back just to be sure I was making the right decision) I would find myself getting sidetracked with how much more I loved the Oasis. It is a lot of money to spend so definitely wait for Prime Day or Cyber Monday sales!!!!! And if you have an old device take the trade in and discount option! It will save you in the long run and wait until it arrives, try it out and if it isnt worth the purchase then return it, but definitely give this one a try!",4 people found this helpful

Even the lowest setting of the light hurt my eyes, and it was super uncomfortable to use. The lack of buttons ended up being super annoying and reading left handed was a chore. I found it better to just read an actual book.Even the updated paper white, which my parents got me as a gift, wasn‚Äôt better. It sat in my desk basically it‚Äôs entire life, and only came out when it was faster to get a download than the physical book from the libraryBut the oasis is a game changer.

I am fortunate to have bought this new Oasis with a generous Birthday gift card from my wife.  My early impressions are WOW.  The 7 inch screen makes a huge difference.  This Kindle is perfectly made with the reader who holds it in hand while reading in mind.  Now, the new warm light is great.  You can schedule it to kick in at a specific time, you can tell it to go by sunrise and sunset, or - simply set it manually.  I have chosen the latter.  By my taste (and use this as a guideline if you wish)  I have brightness set to 15.  I have set warmth to 12.  I use the ""bookerly"" font set at bold setting number 2, and size - number 6.My only complaint is that (I hope AMAZON is listening)  its time to replace the same screensavers that have been used for years.  I think at this price point, the user should have a choice.  The currect book reading's cover is one - perhaps user selected images another.  I have the ad free version and I hold it in hand while reading.  This is the most comfortable reader yet in terms of comfort holding in one hand for hours while reading.  Its worth every penny if you read most days.  Now, battery life seems to be a bit of a disappointment but still - I cannot stir away from giving this genius device 5 stars.  I also recommend the leather feel stickers that are available for the back that will eliminate the issues people have had with the ""slippery"" issues of the past.  This is the KEEPER of Kindles.

I subscribe to the Amazon owned Washington Post at a recurring bargain price of $ 30 per year. It was originally a Prime Day deal. The entire newspaper including all comics and ads.  Even though it is linked to my Amazon account, as an Amazon subscription, with payments to Amazon, I cannot read it on my Kindle reader, just my Fire or IOS devices.  To read it on my Kindle Oasis, I must take the monthly subscription for $ 19.95 a month. Same with all subscriptions.  This is a major disappointment. For that reason, I can‚Äôt recommend it.2.  I got the 32 gb, because I also have Audible.  I thought I could listen to Audible, as I read the book on the Oasis.  You can‚Äôt.  For example, I have the Audible, ‚Äú Sandman).  I also have the Kindle reader version.  It is a very graphic comic book, by graphic, I mean great illustrations.  What I need to do as I go through Sandman, is listen on my IPhone, while following the comic pages on my Fire.  That enhances the experience greatly.  Since I need to use two devices simultaneously, I use the Fire, as it appears in color, vs the BW in the Oasis.

Can read for long periods without it hurting your eyes and it kept a charge for weeks.Kindle Oasis is so much better in every way except for the fact that if you have it fully charged and spend a whole day reading (in my case switching between audiobooks and kindle) it will be at about 19% by the end of the day.  Still pretty good for such heavy use and keeping on WiFi and Bluetooth most the day.The backlights have an energy impact and there is no magic way around that (yet).  Bluetooth and wifi communication also takes it's toll... but its so worth it.  Whispersync is amazing and I'm absorbing stories at such a faster rate and switching between Kindle and Audible versions and having it stay in sync is incredible.  You know those chapters that you don't like as much... the ones with the important but not juicy side storyline - LISTEN to that part while you are doing some low mental intensity activity... then switch to kindle for the juicy parts you want to pause to picture at your leisure.  Also, I don't know why but I just need to have buttons so I can disable touchscreen which was my sole reason for going with the top model (but now that I did I appreciate the auto brightness and auto warmth adjusting).  All around winner... at the end of the day just put the thing on the charger and stop crying about it.",

They're both 300 dpi, both waterproof. and operate identical. I purchased the Oasis as an upgrade to my 5 year old Paperwhite that was 212 dpi.  The difference between dots per inch is not that noticeable.  What is noticeable is the higher level of personalization regarding screen brightness, color intensity of the background, and overall comfort while holding.  Whereas the former Kindle was noticeably heavy, the Oasis is much lighter.  The former had adjustable brightness but the page color was the same, white, though the darker you made the screen the darker the page color got but that also detracted from the readability.  With the warm adjustment of the Oasis you can have bright or dim but still readable pages.  I hope all of that made sense. I like the Oasis, I believe it to be a much improved version of the Paperwhite.  I can't justify it costing as much as it does, I waited for a sale.  If you're not concerned with the brightness, warmness of the page, get the new version of the Paperwhite. The Oasis is the Paperwhite in a different package.  One other thing.  You have the ability to turn the touchscreen off so that you will turn the pages by the buttons, which is easier for me.  The problem with turning them off is you can't make that permanent.  You have to go into settings and turn the touchscreen off each time you open the book.  Amazon folks, do something about that would ya?",One person found this helpful

I found bluish light irritating, reminded me of aftermarket headlights, those in 5000-6000k range.  Warm light has less contrast but it's more natural and sometimes you don't even notice is there.One reason for manufacturer's to use blue light is that it is more efficient and it's possible that 9th get lasts a bit longer on batteries, but 10th gen lasts long enough for me.As I was comparing, I also had an impression that 10th gen was slightly faster redrawing the menus than 9th gen, but difference was just barely noticeable - both are not speed daemons and could be faster.Even though I like it a lot I give this reader 4 stars for two reasons: it lacks USB-C or wireless charging, and process of borrowing books from library has too many steps and requires my assistance when kids want their books.

I loved my kindle keyboard, especially the page turn buttons and  am a frequent reader.  I‚Äôve tried both the paperwhite and Oaisis. I bought the Oaisis strictly for the page turn buttons and they work perfectly.  I don't like having to touch or swipe the screen on the paper white. Also the Oaisis screen is larger so you can see more of the book page. With the Oaisis you easily turn pages without having to lift your hand to touch the screen. The Oaisis screen is super sensitive and so most of the time I turn the touch screen off (a nice feature) and use the side buttons. I also like the ease of changing the font size and amount of light on the screen. What I don‚Äôt like is the shape of the Oaisis, it‚Äôs more of a square but the page turn buttons won me over. If you read a lot the method of turning pages is important. Amazon needs page turn buttons on all the kindles.  The battery life is ok but I do need to charge the Oaisis every few days when I read every day. With the kindle keyboard it lasted about three weeks.  I don't use the other features in the kindle Oaisis like audible or dropping it in water.

The built in LED light is MUCH easier on my eyes than the harsher built in light of my old Kindle. I keep the airplane mode ON to keep the device from 'searching' for Wifi which I think helps the battery life (kind of like a smart phone). I went a couple weeks before having to recharge. A couple drawbacks: 1) A little difficult to get used to holding the device. It feels less like a 'book' than I was used to and therefore a little awkward to handle. 2) I had very meticulously created 'collections' by author and/or series in my old Kindle. These collections did NOT transfer to the new Oasis. ALL my books are in one long stream and NOT in any order.

It does in fact come with a 1 year warranty and Amazon is sending a free replacement.  I still don't like the fact that the screen cracked but at least Amazon addressed the issue.UPDATE:I've had the kindle since Nov 2019.  I was happy with it.  One of the selling points of an ereader is the ability to read outdoors and this model in particular is waterproof.  The first time I used the e-reader for a few hours in the hot sun it got so hot I could no longer use it.  I placed it in my tote that only had a towel in it.  When I went to read it later, the screen was cracked.  It wasn't dropped, it wasn't banged up.  Just cracked.  As mentioned below I have many other Kindles and have used them for years.  Carried in backpacks, suitcases etc.  Never a problem.  I've read in more recent reviews that this model has a problem with screen cracking.  I would agree.  When I contacted customer service they said since I was outside of the 3 month warranty (not a year?) there was nothing they could do except offer me 15% off a new one.  No options for repair at all.DO NOT BUY THE KINDLE OASIS until a new version with a better screen is available.Finally the e-reader I've been looking for.  I own a non-Kindle brand, a Kindle Touch and an older model Kindle Paperwhite.  This has my favorite features of each of those plus more.  I love the option of buttons for page turning and touch mode, I no longer have to worry about gloves or lotions getting in the way.  I can flip easily from between reading left and right sided reading, making drinking coffee and reading easy.  The waterproofing means poolside reading isn't a worry.  Plus my new favorite feature, amber reading at bedtime.  All this plus the ease of using Amazon's Kindle features and benefits.  I'm happy with battery life, as with my other Kindles I keep it in airplane mode unless downloading books.",

One was a Kindle Voyage and the other was a Kindle Fire. Both were in working condition. How do I know for sure? In order to wipe my account information, I had to turn the Voyage on to reset the device to factory setting.A few days after mailing the devices back to Amazon, I received an email notification from the trade-in program to let me know that I have been given $5 credit for the Voyage. The reason given was that it was not a working unit. The original offer of $50 was downgraded. I am stumped. I don‚Äôt care about the financial loss as much as the arbitrary process surrounding the trade-in program.I am writing to caution folks about my experience. I saw another reviewer who faced a similar issue around the same time frame. Beware of the trade-in program. This continues to be an issue for me. I contacted Amazon via chat to inquire about the trade-in results. The first customer service agent had trouble grasping the concept of trade-ins and kept asking me to wait for the return to be finalized so that I can get my refund. After some back and forth, the agent said that Amazon would refund the $45. At that point, I asked if I could get it as a gift card so that I can apply it to the purchase of a new Oasis. I was told no because they only do credit card.Two customer service agents later, I have been informed that the first agent was wrong. Either I was lied to or there is an agent training issue on Amazon‚Äôs end. Either way, the customer loses.As a result of my follow-up, Amazon will ask the trade-in center to look into my case. I don‚Äôt anticipate that they will reverse their decision on my Voyage. Had I known that my Voyage would be erroneously evaluated by as a non-working unit, I would have gladly given the unit away to a friend or donate it.I went ahead with the purchase of the Oasis because I needed one after turning in my two devices to Amazon.

The weight balance is perfect and it‚Äôs easy to hold. Only complaint is the aluminum housing. It‚Äôs too slippery to use comfortably without a cover which is a shame because it‚Äôs so light on its own and having to add weight or any bulkiness to it is a bummer.

I don't like the fact that there isn't really a good way to grip it with one hand (laying on one side/reading in bed) without turning by page by accident or resetting the reading progress settings.  Can something be done with the software so that when you set how you want reading progress and it stays that way and doesn't keep going back to default.  Or if there is a way to make personal setting stay put, make it easier and more intuitive as to how to set it.  Also, it would be nice if there was a way to report poor editing so that corrections might be made down the line.",

The Kobo Forma and the H2O Libra were also given fair consideration. Ultimately, the versatility of the Oasis with its higher quality build, audio book abilities, a more refined and fluid operation along with better value with regard to cost for 32GB won the day. A quick digression; I remain mystified as to the necessity of a 32GB Kobo Forma when it has no capability to accommodate audio books and 8 GB minus whats used for the device's operating system, still allows the devices to hold maybe a reported 4000 books. Perhaps their follow up model?I do wish the Oasis (2019) was priced lower but, with it in hand I say it's quite a jump in quality from other Kindle models, themselves all worthy of ownership.One fair criticism is the lack of better integration of Overdrive into the device. That said, the process to direct a borrowed book to your Amazon account before downloading to the Oasis is by no means a deal breaker. I also understand that ownership of that service lies indirectly with the manufacturer of the Kobo so I'm not holding my breath for the same ease of library borrowing Kobo owners have.In summary, the Oasis (2019) is a lot like the iPad Pro of tablets, the best of class, not close.

I have the kindle, Kobo and nook apps and sometimes a title is cheaper on one of those venues so why not just have so your books on a tablet.This answers that question. First off, this guy is the perfect size and ideal weight for reading.Secondly it's easier on the eyes.Third is it removes distractions when reading. There will be no Facebook notifications on our text msg to interrupt your reading.The third is you have all your titles readily available without having to downloaded and archive books to and from the cloud.There are some drawbacks. The fact that it doesn't support an SD card or USBC drive are chirf amount them.And let's take battery life. Within 1 day the battery life was down to 30%.

Its shape is squarer than the classic Kindle, but it does not get in the way and it maintains that 'lightness' that makes it especially valuable.  The warm light is great.  What I especially value about the Kindle is the basket of nine different fonts that are pre-installed, and the ability to adjust font size and light/dark easily for each of them, as well as page layouts.I recognize two issues with this Kindle, however.  The first issue is that the battery does not seem to last anywhere near the time period Amazon represents.  But since Kindles still last a good amount of time, that is only an medium annoyance.  The second issue is one that should have been corrected last year - the Kindle still uses a USB micro connector, and not the new and more robust USB-C plug.  I expect that will prove to be much more than an annoyance in the future, as almost all of my other electronics are already using USB-C connecters, and will force me to carry more cables as I travel.  Other than those two items, I am quite happy with the product.  I hope Amazon will allow a generous trade-in when it eventually moves to the USB-C connector.  It should.",

It only had 2gigs of space on it and I had it for 7 years. I had been eyeing the Oasis since it came out, but decided to wait on purchasing one until it had a large amount of reviews.I pulled the trigger and got a deal on my Paperwhite turn in and also a discount on the Oasis. I love everything about it. I like that I can flip it 180 degrees and it flips the book. I like that I can adjust the tint and hue for less strain on the eyes. I love that it has 32 GB of space for all of my books and several audio books. With the audio books, you just pair a set of bluetooth headphones or buds and that's it. Pretty easy.One of the best features is the two buttons which I use all the time when laying down and reading. It just makes flipping pages so much easier than swiping the screen. You don't necessarily have to swipe the screen, just touch it and it changes pages. But, I have shaky hands (essential tremors), so sometimes I might accidentally double tap it making me lose my place. The buttons keep this from happening.I highly recommend this device over all of them if you're able to get it. You won't be disappointed.",2 people found this helpful

Well, I hot the new one and had a lot of similar issues, but the issue is knowing how to use it. Now, after about 40 books, I've almost figured out how to use the damn thing. But I  read for 3 to 5 hours a night as part of my sleeping routine. I don't sleep well. I also use blue light glasses to cut the blue light hitting my eyes. My cell phone has this as an additional feature. Well, I've read a lot of books, all action/adventure, and I'm not sleeping any worse, but not a lot better. I think my problem is subject matter. I live in south Florida, have spent years in the Bahamas and Keys, and this is the backdrop to all of my books. So, I will now start searching of non-action/adventure style books.

However, I read another review praising the ""warm"" lighting feature and I was intrigued. I finally decided to get it (not only for the light, but the different design and larger screen,) and I am so happy I did!The light: I thought the warm-light thing would be sort of a gimmick, but it's really not. IMHO it is a much more pleasant reading experience than the cold white of my old Paperwhite. Amazon would do really well to put it in all their models. I don't really like the auto-brightness feature on *any* device though, and it's no different here; I just adjust the lighting manually.The design: The buttons and weird shape are actually really well placed. Because of the auto-rotate function, I can hold it in either hand and have the page buttons right under my thumb, and the 'bump' on the back actually makes it easier to hold, since the buttons are on the same side.The battery: The battery isn't as good as my paperwhite. Don't get me wrong, it's still great, but with the added lights, the battery is used faster -- it still lasts several days for me though!Miscellaneous: I bought mine bundled with the case/cover, and I *highly* recommend doing this. Not only does it protect the screen, but the Oasis automatically turns on/off with the magnetic cover.Overall I am very pleased with the Oasis, and my eyes thank me for it ;-)",3 people found this helpful

I don't recommend using the kindle to search for books and such even though that option is available. Use the kindle app for that. It's much faster. E ink screens also aren't optimized for frequent changes in the display. If you constantly search for things or read PDFs where you ahve to pan around the screen a lot to position the text, you'll notice that the battery is going down much quicker than it should. Knowing how the display works can help you optimize how you use your device! My only negative is that I wish the screen were bigger!

Kindle Oasis ‚Äì With 7‚Äù display and page turn buttons,3.0,Touch screen logic could be much improved,"Reviewed in the United States on August 13, 2019",Digital Storage Capacity: 8 GB | Offer Type: Lockscreen Ad-Supported | Color: Graphite | Option: Without Kindle Unlimited,True,"I was a hold out from a few years back, still using a Kindle 5 (from 2012) that had physical page turn buttons and, most importantly, no touch screen.  I held my Kindle while reading like I would hold a physical book--meaning there's no one spot you hold it.  While holding something in your hands for a long time you naturally move it around a bit, adjusting your grip.  The problem is when your hands, especially larger hands like mine, brush the screen and start turning pages on you, especially the Oasis which has no difference in ""elevation"" between the screen and border.  The new Oasis has an option for disabling the touch screen until you turn it off and back on again but considering there is no other button to access special functions (even something as simple as checking the time or adjusting the backlight) this option really is a bit of a pain.  I'm not sure why they can't allow the user to adjust the border sensitivity in a way that you would have the option to tap more centrally in the screen to do things.  This way accidental swipes of my thumb on the edges would not do anything.  This new Oasis is not more comfortable in my hand for this main reason.  I feel I have to be careful on how I hold the device and that leads to strain.  I miss my Kindle 5, however the device really just stopped working and had become unusable.With all that said... the new Oasis is much more advanced than my Kindle 5.  The backlight is great, especially that you can make it a warmer color.  When you WANT to use the extra functionality (via the touch screen) it is quite the capable device.  Waterproofing is a bonus though the metal exterior is showing prints and smudges easier than the plastic did on the Kindle 5 and is a little ""colder"" feeling.I just wish Amazon would add the ability for the user to tweak the touchscreen.  For me it's a major deterrent to reading with this device.  And if they can disable the entire thing via software I know they can allow modifications to the zones.

I had to have a pop socket on the back of my Paperwhite to hold it with one hand, but this one is so easy to grip without anything extra. I also love how crisp the text is and how even the light is distributed on the screen.  My Paperwhite you could see exactly where the lights were, the Oasis is even across the whole front.

Kindle Oasis ‚Äì With 7‚Äù display and page turn buttons,4.0,Mixed Feelings,"Reviewed in the United States üá∫üá∏ on February 13, 2020",Digital Storage Capacity: 8 GB | Offer Type: Lockscreen Ad-Supported | Color: Graphite | Option: Without Kindle Unlimited,True,"I wanted to love this, but unfortunately I'm a bit disappointed. I bought this mainly for the page buttons. I LOVE having page buttons. I cannot express my love for the page buttons enough - I much prefer them to constantly having to touch the screen, and these work wonderfully. The screen / display is absolutely beautiful and a good size. That said, I mainly use the Oasis at home, and so prefer not to use a cover to keep it slim and light. Without a cover, the Oasis metal body is usually searingly cold. In addition, the large side grip throws the weight distribution off and feels heavy and unwieldy for longer one handed reading sessions. Those drawbacks unfortunately make me often go back to my old Paperwhite. (I dream of a Paperwhite with page turn buttons. This must be possible....the original Kindles had page turn buttons.) So overall, especially considering the price of the device, I'm not as happy with the Oasis as I had hoped to be, and will likely trade it back in the future. If you are trying to decide if you should buy this model, it certainly has some great features, and worth a try to see how it works for you. But I advise keeping a close eye on the return window.",
Kindle Oasis ‚Äì With 7‚Äù display and page turn buttons,5.0,Great tool!

Easy to use if you look at the manual which is preloaded as one of your books. The lights do a excellent job for reading anytime, any light source( none to full sun.) and with the 32 gig hard drive can store a lifetime of reading the first time you pick it up. (First load, 6,100 titles.)  This wonderful tool work with audiobooks, Kindle .mobi,  .epub, and .pdf files.  The only NEGATIVE so far is the charging system. The supplied charging cord is about 2.5 foot long not long enough to reach the dresser top. If you do not read the reviews and all of the info you do not have enough to charge the Kindle when you get it in your home as there is nothing to plug the power cord into to plug in the wall. That correct, there  is not a transformer included. If your computer is short on USB ports you will have to unplug some device to charge your Kindle and even then you might not charge your Kindle as not all USB ports have the correct current needed to power and charge this Kindle.Kindle is still stuck in the old school about charging in another way, you can not grab another device cord like an Apple, Samsung, etc. (USB-C)  and plug the Kindle in, it takes a special more fragile plug type, Micro USB port, that you need to look at each time you plug it in or you could damage the cord or the Kindle info and charging port or both at the same time.",41 people found this helpful
Kindle Oasis ‚Äì With 7‚Äù display and page turn buttons,5.0,Totally worth the upgrade from my Paperwhite,"Reviewed in the United States üá∫üá∏ on April 15, 2020",Digital Storage Capacity: 8 GB | Offer Type: Lockscreen Ad-Supported | Color: Graphite | Option: Without Kindle Unlimited,True,"I thought that I would offer this review of the Kindle Oasis.  I am a long time Kindle user and read about a book a week.  I have used the Kindle app on an iPad and have owned three different Kindle devices.  Most recently I had the Kindle Paperwhite.  I decided to upgrade to the Oasis primarily for the bigger screen and because I read quite a bit in low light.  I could not be happier with the Oasis and feel that the premium price was completely worth it for me.  The interface is the same as the Paperwhite, and the screen is noticeably bigger.  By far, the biggest advantage that I can see is how the screen adapts as the light changes.  I have mine set to auto, so I get a whiter screen during the day and a warmer yellower one at night.  The night (warmer light) tends to make reading much easier on my eyes and disturbs my wife less as well.  I like the build quality and aluminum back to on Oasis. The hump seems to fit perfectly in my hand.  I also find that the page turn buttons work better for me than touching the screen.  The Paperwhite was a great device but I received $30 to trade it in plus another 20% off the Oasis.  Hope this short review helps.",4 people found this helpful

The ability to choose a warm background for the text is a game changer.  I loved my Voyage, it has traveled the world with me, but really like my Oasis.  I have seen several write of very short battery life and at first I thought I was seeing that also.  Then I realized it was downloading my library, as I had instructed, in the background.  Once that was done it seems to have battery life equivalent to what I saw with my Voyage.  So far I have few complaints.  My next Kindle ereader  i think I will order ad free.Amazon has gotten more aggressive with their advertising and I am a bit put off by it.After using the Oasis for a few months I decided to amend my review.  It is too big.  It won‚Äôt find in jacket pockets, Jean pockets or anything I normally wear.  I cannot take it with me as I have always done with my Voyage.  I still carry my Voyage, the Oasis stays home.  It is more like a hard back book, not really good for travel. Perhaps a nice Paperwhite would be a better choice.

Didn‚Äôt know what to expect. I‚Äôd used the app before but an actual Kindle doesn‚Äôt really compare. Took me a while to choose the right one and although the price for the Oasis is significantly higher, the two features that sold me were the page turn buttons (although I switched their functions) and the warm light. I was unaware of the e-ink technology but find it pleasing. It did take me a minute to get used to the flashing sometimes but now I understand it‚Äôs not a defect but rather a feature of the technology. I also stupidly thought the image on the screen when I opened the box was a sticker and spent a few seconds trying to peel it off. Learned that the technology doesn‚Äôt require any battery power to keep an image on the screen once the e-ink has drawn it. Nifty. I had resisted going electronic with books for years but what finally did it for me was a chunk of hair that was hidden and mashed in between some pages of a book I ordered off Amazon. I promptly threw the book away, continued reading it on the app on my iPad and began looking at Kindles. I‚Äôm glad I did. I love the Oasis. Special mention for the battery life.

It makes my 2014 Paperwhite seem blurry by comparison.The amber tinge to the light with a timer that can turn it on or off. This makes it very comfortable for the eyes.Cons:It is clad in aluminum, which makes it appear to be a more premium product. But it also makes it hard to hold onto without a case. It was work to grip this while reading in bed. It really needs to be textured.The battery, probably due to the extra LEDs, doesn't hold a charge as well as prior Kindles.Some seem upset that it isn't USB C but I think thats a silly objection. YMMV.Unfortunately the slipperiness is a deal breaker for me and I'm returning it. It is a shame as I really like the screen and can live with the battery limitations, but why should I have to purchase a case for it just to be able to hold on to it. If you‚Äôre planning on buying a case and can live with the battery issues and the lack of a USB C port, then this is a great e-reader.

My number one leasure activity is reading.  I read hundreds of books a year.  I don't watch TV, I don't do social media outside of work, I play with my animals, I tend my fish tanks, and I snuggle with a cat on the couch listening to Amazon music and READ.  I have carpul tunnel in my right hand and moderate arthritis in most finger joints from years of working with horses and hitting my late fifties.  I LOVE the button push page turn., and the fact I can turn the oasis upside down, so the page turn is on right or left side as my choice.  This combined with the touch screen works with my hands better than the hold and swipe required by the paperwhite.  Is this worth a $150 more than the PW?  I'm not sure for many folks it is, but for me, it works better and as my primary leasure escape, it was worth the money spent.Also the page color is great!

I wasn‚Äôt sure I would love it because of the ‚Äúbump‚Äù in the back. I read reviews saying that it wasn‚Äôt evenly weighted and hard to hold...I wasn‚Äôt sure it was worth the money to upgrade.

All the extra features of the oasis makes my reading experience better. It is an expensive device but it is worth it to me because I am an avid reader and always have been. I received mine on release day and the battery life has been great and the lights are evenly displayed across the screen. I take it with me even when traveling and it is so clear in the sunlight.

Kindle Oasis ‚Äì With 7‚Äù display and page turn buttons,5.0,LOVE,"Reviewed in the United States on March 13, 2020",,True,"If you‚Äôre wondering if the extra money is worth it for the oasis instead of the paper white, in my opinion it ABSOLUTELY is. The main differences are the screen size, the buttons, and the screen temperature function. I use my kindle just about everyday, and I use the buttons and adjust the temperature(make the screen a warmer yellow tone more than white) all of the time. The screen can automatically adjust brightness and warmth, which is awesome. I love the buttons and the screen size is great. It‚Äôs for sure larger than my phone screen so it‚Äôs easier to read for me.I will say though that without a case it does feel a little fragile, it‚Äôs very thin and light which is good but it also feel like I could snap it in half - I don‚Äôt think you easily can but that‚Äôs what it feels like. But, with a case it feels more durable and gives it a nice weight.Also, the battery is fantastic. I keep it in airplane mode most of the time so the battery lasts about 1.5-2 weeks for me.Overall I love my kindle oasis and am very happy that I chose it over the paper white. I‚Äôm sure the paper white is amazing as well, it just comes down to preference and if you would use the features of the oasis enough to make it worth the price.",3 people found this helpful

Well, the new lighting makes the Oasis 3 an absolute joy to read on. The screen is a warmer tone, even with the amber set to off, and, with the amber on, you can attain a rich sepia tint, which is just divine to read on.This lighting, coupled with the amazon Merlot cover, which smells and looks so good, as well as feeling beautifully smooth and tactile in the hand, mean I am reading so much more than ever before.I have used ereaders since 2010, starting with the Kindle 2, moving through the Paperwhite, Voyage, Kobo Aura One (first amber lighting on an ereader), then Amazon lured me back with the Oasis 2. I never fell in love with the Oasis 2, although I enjoyed the larger screen, it just seemed a little cold and clinical.In short, the amber light makes a massive difference. Battery life is still, frankly, poor. But I don‚Äôt care anymore as I love the screen so much. I just plug it in for a while when I‚Äôm passing the charger. The only thing missing now is the ability to use the current book cover as the screen saver. But that‚Äôs a minor niggle, and as I have special offers removed plus an auto wake cover, I‚Äôm not really seeing the screensavers too often anyway.I also love the Champagne gold color, and the way the edges gleam around the border while in the merlot cover.

I was really looking forward to having physical page-turn buttons again, and the warm light since I do most of my reading at night.The warm light is indeed wonderful. The larger screen is very nice. That's about all the positives I have.The battery life of this device is horrible. I need to charge mine about every 3 days - and I only get about 1-2 hours of reading in per day, thanks to my 2-month-old. This is with Airplane mode on, and the light set to '1' (yes, just 1), with a very small font size to minimize page turns/refreshes, and with the page-refresh option off. I don't know what else can be done to improve battery life but also can't help but wonder why so much compromise is necessary to make the device usable, when the tradeoffs aren't required on older, cheaper devices.When I get the 'low battery warning' on this device, I have about 20 minutes before it needs to be plugged in, making it unlikely for me to even finish the current reading session. Can you imagine the reviews a cell phone would¬†have in 2022 if it needed to be charged after ~3 hours of use? My Paperwhite could make it a week even with very high usage, and even a few days after the 'low battery' warning - and I never turned on Airplane mode or did anything on that device to attempt to maximize battery life.The Oasis battery even drains while sitting, sleeping. Airplane mode on. Backlight off. What is it doing?This may seem an overly critical or whiny review, but the magic of Kindle to me has always been that it's like a book, of course. You just pick it up and it's ready to go. If I wanted yet another device I need to plug in almost every day or stress about power levels, I wouldn't bother with a Kindle. And I don't understand the battery life deficit. The device is larger, it is heavier, it costs significantly more; why in the world does it have a smaller battery?¬†TL;DR: Keep your Paperwhite and your money.",9 people found this helpful

Kindle Oasis ‚Äì With 7‚Äù display and page turn buttons,3.0,2019 Kindle Oasis Still Has Battery Failure Issues,"Reviewed in the United States üá∫üá∏ on September 5, 2020",Digital Storage Capacity: 8 GB | Offer Type: Lockscreen Ad-Supported | Color: Graphite | Option: Without Kindle Unlimited,True,"I purchased my Kindle Oasis from an authorized reseller in November 2019 (ten months ago). Over the last several months, I've noticed that I get less and less battery life on each successive charge. When it got to the point where I was charging the device every day under normal use, I contacted Amazon support to request an exchange under Amazon's one-year limited warranty policy for this device.During the chat, I conversed with two service reps. Both gave me the feeling that their priority was to persuade me from returning the item under warranty. I actually had to copy and paste Amazon's own warranty policy into the chat box to convince the first rep that it was Amazon's responsibility to replace the defective item.Collectively, it took nearly an hour for me to convince the service reps to send me a new, functional Oasis, and to send me a return mailing label so I could send back the Oasis that was not functioning properly. That's completely unacceptable.For a $300 purchase, not only do I expect better product quality from an Amazon Kindle device, I also expect more attentive service representatives who listen the first time I say I simply want to exchange an Amazon product.Needless to say, if this battery fails I'll never purchase another Oasis. It's a fine ereader, but not $300 fine. I don't notice that much of a difference in the screen resolution from my 7th gen Kindle Paperwhite, and I never had battery issues with my three previous Kindle ereaders.My advice is to skip purchasing this device.

Kindle Oasis ‚Äì With 7‚Äù display and page turn buttons,5.0,Best Kindle yet....,"Reviewed in the United States üá∫üá∏ on October 23, 2019",Digital Storage Capacity: 8 GB | Offer Type: Lockscreen Ad-Supported | Color: Graphite | Option: Without Kindle Unlimited,True,"....of the ones I‚Äôve owned. I started way back with that first white clunky one with the bottom keyboard and have progressed through the years. Each one I purchase is a bit better than the one before. I like the size of this. It seems a bit wider than my Paperwhite was, but the reading screen seems bigger so that‚Äôs a plus. I really like the warm light feature. It seems extra easy on the eyes while reading, and you can pretty much adjust it to work any way you like.I also really like the page turn buttons. I never knew how much I missed them til now. With my PW, you had to swipe each page, so this one is better.  You can literally read one handed while holding plus clicking the pages. My reason for the 4 stars on Easy to Hold , is the fact that it takes a bit of getting used to. I‚Äôm still switching between using the top or bottom button for my page- forward, thus a bit less stars for now. I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll adjust to it quickly.I have yet to try my Audible with this , so will add on to the review once I give that a go.Amazon, you‚Äôve done it again. Made an improvement on something that was already pretty doggone good !",
Kindle Oasis ‚Äì With 7‚Äù display and page turn buttons,5.0,Worth the upgrade if you're a few generations behind,"Reviewed in the United States üá∫üá∏ on February 26, 2020",Digital Storage Capacity: 8 GB | Offer Type: Lockscreen Ad-Supported | Color: Graphite | Option: Without Kindle Unlimited,True,"Having a perfectly good 1st Gen Paperwhite, I was hesitant to buy the new Oasis. With the 20% trade-in they now offer plus $25 for a good condition Paperwhite, I essentially got $75 off the new Oasis. For a 2012 Kindle, I thought that was worth it. Now that I've owned it a few weeks, it was definitely worth it. The screen alone look so much better than the generation I had. I always missed the physical page buttons from the kindle keyboard I had before the Paperwhite. The lighter weight is highly noticeable too. The battery drains fairly quickly if connected to WIFI constantly. It lasted about a week with about 2 hours of reading a day while connected. 2nd week disconnected and I had a little under 50% after that week. The warm light is a great addition and is very easy on the eyes in low light. The page buttons do make a soft ""click"" that only once bothered my wife while she was trying to fall asleep. Fortunately, the touch screen works well too. Finally, being able to switch hands and flip the screen is very convenient. I'm able to flip the case over so I can use the cover to shield the light from my better half while sleeping. I love it and feel the upgrade was well worth it.",2 people found this helpful

I do keep my kindle on airplane mode when not downloading a new book and that's enough to last my battery life for I don't know how long. I just plug it in whenever I remember which isn't often. The size factor is perfect. Bigger would not be as convenient to carry around and big enough to read comfortably. Take my word for it and just buy it!,

I upgraded from the base model to a voyage for the page turn buttons.  The electronic buttons on the voyage were lackluster at best.  So I decided to try out the oasis.I've had the oasis for about a week so far and I really like it.  The physical page turn buttons are excellent!  The battery life so far has been good, fully charges it when I opened it and its at 77% with moderate use.  The ""warm"" page light is a nest feature that I am enjoying as well.  The ""bulge"" on the right side had me concerned but I find that I actually like it as it gives me a better grip on the reader.One detractor in my opinion is the price.  With holiday sales and trade in I purchased mine for almost half price.  At that selling point its a no brainer for me.  At normal, full price I probably would not have purchased it.All in all a great e-reader and a good upgrade from my voyage.  Price point is a consideration but otherwise I am very happy with the operation and function of it.",

Speaking of page turns, the turn button is so convenient and ensures that I don't leap ahead or back unintentionally. Being able to set the brightness of the screen, the warmth of the background, the size of the type, and being able to flip it open (I got the leather cover too) in the middle of the night and read without turning on a light is so convenient.The ability to access word definitions, Wikipedia, and more right from my reading screen are wonderful and it's light weight means I can take it with me easily and I always have a book with me!Some people have complained about the battery life.

I can grab the latest books and not need to worry about shipping and paper waste.I read lots or reviews and I thought the complaints about USB-C were a little out of touch but I really agree now. I read a lot more than 30 minutes a day so I need to charge it more often. Usually at night before bed and I have to make sure I've got it right tired and sleepy which is not a deal breaker but it is annoying.The touch screen has issues with highlighting the word above what I am trying to highlight and as a smart phone user I'm sure my placement is correct.The warm light is spot on.

Kindle Oasis ‚Äì With 7‚Äù display and page turn buttons,2.0,Waste of time and money for a device that does ONLY one thing.,"Reviewed in the United States on May 15, 2021",Digital Storage Capacity: 8 GB | Offer Type: Lockscreen Ad-Supported | Color: Graphite | Option: Without Kindle Unlimited,True,"I just bought a kindle oasis from Best Buy. I also bought a kindle paper white a month ago at target. Both of these devices are seriously over priced for there functionality. I could get a fully functional laptop for the combined total I spent on these devices.I originally bought the paper white because I desperately needed to relieve the strain on my eyes that my constant reading on the kindle app on my phone was causing. The migraines were getting too consistent. So I broke down and splurged to get it. The relief was almost instant!! I was thrilled that the pain slowly disappeared and I was reading with no issues. But in the month I‚Äôve had that first device I‚Äôve found that it can‚Äôt keep up with my needs. I download books all the time and in quick fast hurry situations, but the paper white works slower then dialup used to!! I don‚Äôt have time or patience to deal with this and considering the $130 + the $30 case I was seriously annoyed!So I asked on here how fast the oasis works. I got only one answer stating that the buttons allow for fast page turning. Yes the page turning on the paper white was sluggish but that wasn‚Äôt really what I needed to know.So I sucked it up and went to the store and bought the oasis with the understanding that I have time to return it even if used. So now I‚Äôm here to give my two cents on the oasis. As my complaint is that for the prices of any of these models it is too slow, then the oasis is marginally better than the paper white but ONLY marginally. It is faster but it freezes if you try to download too many books at once. Since I need this device to be fully loaded for my everyday use I‚Äôm sitting here waiting for it to restart now for the third time in less than two hours. My iPhone app that glitches constantly works better than these devices do.For the price of $260 the oasis is a ripoff plain and simple. A child‚Äôs toy has stronger processing ability than this ereader has. And for the sole purpose of being an ereader it in no way should cost $260. End of.",One person found this helpful

I love my Kindle Oasis and will not need to purchase another Kindle. The battery lasts longer than the one on my Kindle Paperwhite. The touch buttons are fabulous but you can also use the touchscreen. The best part is the amount of text on the page which is why I am writing this review.I am 50 years old and my eyesight is not superb. I work on a computer all day long so I appreciate the larger screen on the Oasis. There is more text on the page and the screen is square as opposed to rectangular on the other Kindles. And the adjustable backlight is a game changer. I love the warm light. I set my Oasis to a warm yellow for the evenings and it is a pleasure to read. No more headaches!I love my Oasis so much that I gave away my other Kindles. There is just no going back from the Oasis for me.Bottom line: If you have aging eyes & trouble with eye strain, then the Oasis is worth the price. If you are happy with reading on another Kindle, then you don‚Äôt need to run out and buy the Oasis. However, if you do buy the Oasis you will love it.",

The two issues I have... 1) battery life is not  as long as advertised.  mind you it's longer than my kindle paperwhite but only if I make sure auto lighting is off and turn everything down to the minimum setting with lighting .  There are a lot of times when I can see the home screen on the page I am reading. it's not enough to disrupt the reading but I see it.  sometimes I see the previous page behind the page I am reading.  again I am not unable to read but for the money I invested in this I would have expected better.

My kindle now only needs to be recharged once every 2.5 weeks which is on par with the Paperwhite I had before the Oasis 9. Of all the kindles I've had, this hits all the wants (minus the price).

I pay for a brand new device only to have it replaced with a refurb one in 10 days. I called out Amazon on this BS and they said there's nothing they can do as their systems are programmed to only send refurbished units as replacements (more BS). I sent the refurbished unit back. No way!My conclusion is the Oasis has 25 LEDs vs the 5 on the PaperWhite. This may be the reason for the PW offering a stellar battery performance. With the Oasis, you'd be lucky to get a week's worth of battery even with moderate reading. I think that's just the way things are with this device. People who haven't used the PW won't notice this but for users like me who were on the paperwhite for years before switching will definitely see how bad the battery is on the Oasis.I have put mine on airplane mode and it still drains the battery at the rate of 1 to 2% every few hours, on standby. So just know what you are getting into. If you are a heavy reader, be prepared to recharge this often.UPDATE # 1I upgraded from a paperwhite I had since 2014 and boy do I regret it. The screen is an inch bigger and that's about the only benefit it has over my PW kindle from 2014. Here are my observations after approx two weeks:1. Battery life sucks! I charged it completely and left it on stand-by only to notice the battery draining at the rate of about 8% per day. Which means that the Oasis may drain out the battery on stand-by in about two weeks if not sooner. This is crazy! My PW went on for months on stand-by.2. While reading the battery drain is much quicker. May be I got a device with bad battery?3. Amazon customer support told me turn of wi-fi and use it only when downloading. That is such BS. I am connected to my home wi-fi and I know it does not keep searching for a wifi signal unless the wifi drops, which has never happened since I bought this device. I never had to play with wifi with my older Kindle.4. Screen responsiveness has NOT improved. I would have assumed Amazon would have made real progress here with the e-ink technology and made scrolls and page turns more fluid. But it's the same as my 2014 PW. They just added the page turn buttons to charge a higher price point. I still prefer tapping on the screen for page turns.I will be sending this back for a replacement. If battery continues to suck on the replacement, I'm getting a refund.",23 people found this helpful
Kindle Oasis ‚Äì With 7‚Äù display and page turn buttons,3.0,"Nice, But The Previous One Was Better","Reviewed in the United States on August 4, 2019",Digital Storage Capacity: 8 GB | Offer Type: Lockscreen Ad-Supported | Color: Graphite | Option: Without Kindle Unlimited,True,"If you're coming from a Paperwhite, this is a nice upgrade.  The screen is bigger (for me, that extra inch makes it feel much more like the page of a book), it has nicely-clicky buttons for turning pages, the aluminum chassis is solid and beautifully sculpted, it has the new yellow light feature, and the case is designed as a handgrip for very comfortable one-handed reading.It is that last point that presented the biggest disappointment with this version.  While the case looks identical to the previous-generation Oasis, Amazon for some reason omitted the magnets that allowed magnetic cases to attach to the back of the device.  This type of case is by far the best option for those who often (but not necessarily always) prefer to use the device ""naked"" (i.e., without a case) for easy one-handed reading.  With the last Oasis, that type of case would magnetically pop onto the device, then you could easily pop it away when you wanted to use the device without it.  Much to my disappointment, the lack of magnets in this new version means that this type of case no longer works.Why is this important?  If you use a ""traditional"" (i.e., non-magnetic) case, such as those Amazon now sells, you flip the case cover around the device to the back to read.  This would be fine, except that it completely covers the grip built into the device, rendering it unusable.  By omitting the magnets, Amazon has thus neutered the device's best and most distinctive feature -- its built-in handgrip.  Especially frustrating about this decision is that the device's shape remains a key selling point -- just one that happens to be undercut completely by the current non-magnetic case.  I hate this, and it makes me very disappointed with this purchase.But yes, it turns yellow.",62 people found this helpful

That being said, the build quality just isn't up to par for the cost. The ergonomic grip is a bit too slippery and not quite big enough to hold comfortably. The glass (which feels a bit plasticky) is set unevenly in the chassis, which leads to unsightly bits of dust gathering in the gaps. The display is good, but the color of the built-in light--while evenly distributed across the screen--is lacking in warmth. The warmest setting is a bit jaundiced and would be more pleasing if there was a bit of pinkish light mixed with the yellow. Am I nitpicking? Yes, but for this price, I feel like consumers deserve to know the shortcomings. I'm pleased with my purchase, but it might not be for everybody.",

It now looks like a phone interface, and I can't express how deeply disappointed I am. It no longer feels like an ""oasis"" from electronics or even like an e-reader. It has the aesthetic of a cheap children's gadget. It honestly makes me wish I'd never bought this and fallen in love with the way it used to be, because I miss it so much now.

It's my 3rd Kindle.  My first was the Keyboard version.  It still, actually works.  My second, and favorite, was the Voyage.  Why they stopped making it, in favor of this version is beyond me.  It was 10 times better.  The Oasis is waterproof.  That's about the only thing to recommend it above the Voyage.  The Oasis is larger, and the buttons for page turning are not placed well.  The forward button should be the lower one where ones hand conveniently rests when reading.  That's where placement was on the Voyage.........much better.  The battery life is not as promised.  Quite frankly, it stinks.  It's the worst of any previous Kindle I've had.  I may end up putting this in a drawer and use my old Voyage until it dies.  For the price, this should be a much better, more advanced, well thought out product.  Lastly, I was appalled at the packaging.  The Kindle, contained in its little box, was in a large box with 2 heavy bottles of leather cleaner/conditioner.  There was no bubble wrap or anything else to prevent them from banging together.  It's a miracle the Oasis was even functional.  For something this expensive I would expect better shipping/packaging consideration.  Poorly done Amazon!",2 people found this helpful

I read every day, though not as long or as fast as many other people.  Two months after I bought this, it got caught in the car door while in my pocket.

My Voyage and my base kindle both last about a month with daily reading.  This Oasis was not holding a charge so I reset it to factory and turned the warm and brightness down as low as I could.  Nevertheless, after reading 40% of a small novel (250 pages), my charge was down to 40% the next day.Daily charging wouldn't be so bad except it takes a micro usb, which I do not keep in my bathroom, which is where I read so if I were to drop it in the tub, this Kindle would not be ruined. (My base kindle stays in the car to read when I'm out and about and my voyage stays near my bed to read in bed). Charging the Kindle once a month on the micro usb is not so bad, but daily charging is simply not worth the trouble.Save your money and get a base kindle.",One person found this helpful

So, I spoke with support and they were kind and told me they‚Äôd send me a new device. All I‚Äôd have to do is return the one that wasn‚Äôt charging. They sent me a REFURBISHED device!!!! My Oasis was only a month old! I should have received a brand new device! Yet again, you disappoint me, Amazon. Down to ONE star. If this device gives me any trouble I want a FULL REFUND!UPDATE: I am removing a star because I have only been able to charge this device to 100% ONCE! Even after an overnight charge, it doesn‚Äôt go to 100%. Then they battery drains so fast that I have to charge it again within 24 hours.I‚Äôve been using my new Oasis for about a month now and to be honest, I am not impressed. I should have just ordered another Paperwhite. While this Kindle boasts all those built in  lights, I‚Äôve noticed that the words and images leave a shadow/ghost when you turn the page. That is really annoying. The only way I have found to avoid this is to turn up the ‚Äúwarmth‚Äù in my setting. But I don‚Äôt want to read with that orange tinge during the day. It is easier on the eyes at night in the dark though.The first few times I charged it, it wouldn‚Äôt charge past the 99% mark. Very strange. I can get it to charge to 100% now though, not sure why that happened. I hope this doesn‚Äôt change. (See above UPDATE! This has NOT improved!)I never use the touch screen when I read because I prefer the page turn buttons. I missed those on my Paperwhite. My first Kindle reader had the page turn buttons on both sides and it was wonderful. I don‚Äôt care for a touch screen.It takes forever for it to connect to WiFi. When I turn off the airplane mode, I have to wait quite a while for it to connect. When I say that, I mean probably more than a minute or two. I never attach to Bluetooth so I have no comment on that feature.When turning on my Oasis for the first time each day, or if I am turning it on after a few hours of not reading, it has to ‚Äúwake up‚Äù. My Paperwhite would come to life immediately. With the Oasis, I am once again left waiting before it brings my book up. It may be only 20 seconds or so, but it‚Äôs not instant like with the Paperwhite.Overall, I‚Äôm extremely disappointed in the Oasis and think that the price Amazon charges over the Paperwhite is pure greed. Do yourself a favor and stick with the Paperwhite. I was happy with mine for many years and thought this would be an upgrade. I wish I had bought the Voyage (or Voyager- I can‚Äôt remember what it was called) when that had been available. The Oasis is a letdown.",16 people found this helpful

I very much like the Warm Light feature. It is much easier on my eyes in the dark while in bed. I wonder why this feature had not been included in previous versions. Marketing strategy, I conclude. With my 9th Gen Oasis trade in, this 10th Gen cost me $112 USD. B&N had just released a new Nook with this feature. I decided the 10th was a better item for its shape and grasping friendliness and I incorrectly presumed, my Casebot fabric cover would fit and function on it. Wrong! The Casebot fits just fine; 9th & 10th Gens are identical in physical dimensions. But, the magnetic switch on the 10th Gen that operates the wake/sleep function interaction with the cover, has been re-positioned. The old cover will not wake/sleep the 10th Gen Oasis. So, to retrieve this feature I have to purchase a new $40 cover. That essentially brings the cost of the new Oasis to 112 + 40 = $152 USD. In engineering and consumerism, we call this ""built-in obsolescence."" The position of the magnetic switch could have been retained from the 9th to the 10th such that the cover would work identically on both 9th and 10th.",One person found this helpful

Because I stand and hold a strap, being able to change hands and use the page turn buttons effortlessly made me happy that I chose the Oasis over the Paperwhite.  For my needs, the Oasis does it all.  My default is to have it in airplane mode, so battery life has been pretty good.  I read so many reviews before this purchase, especially because I happily used my Paperwhite for almost six years, and did not want to make the wrong choice!  I used my last Paperwhite for years, so would not usually but something just because it was new.  But this 10th gen. Oasis is the best e reader I have ever used.

My current one is the tenth or eleventh generation, but it hardly matters.  It's a lovely machine to look at and, if it worked anything like it's advertised be desirable (even though the price is too damn steep for even the Mercedes Benz of e-readers...you know, the ones that haven't been built yet).  The one problem is that the Oasis should never have been released at all.  Nobody seems to have worked out its abundant bugs and features that don't work.  I agree that the battery life really sucks...completely pathetic and not remotely as advertised.  But that is something I could live with.  The real thing is that it malfunctions several imes a day.  It hangs up ALL THE TIME, at which point, it must be re-started manually.  Much of the time, that manual re-set doesn't work and there times you have to tether it and then push the button for several minutes (today, it was close to TEN MINUTES and after I finally got it working, it's been charging for well over an hour and it's at 46%).  It was 84% last night and this morning, it was zero to such a degree that I had to charge it for 15 minutes before I got the logo, at which point it still wouldn't start.  And it's not just this device...this is true for all three models I've had (not counting one I had to send back).  I also have a paperwhite, and, while it screws up from time to time and has to re-set itself, its operation is seamless compared with the Oasis.  Amazon has become famous for throwing new devices on the market that have not been adequately vetted and tested and which basically suck.  It's as if we're beta-testing every one of them, but we're beta-testing at full price.  I actually think that Amazon should issue some kind of credit (real credit, NOT twenty bucks or whatever) for the suckers like us who've bought these miserable machines.  DO NOT BUY AN OASIS.  The last time I complained to Customer Service, I was told that Amazon is aware of these flaws and has stopped recommending that users buy them.  If this is the case, they ought to make it good somehow with the people who've already bought them, much to our general dismay.  If I could have written this review and given the device zero stars, I would have done so, because one star implies to me that, on some level, it's ok.  But it ain't.",9 people found this helpful

It is faster and more responsive than my Paperwhite and the pictures are clearer. And I have yet to encounter the refresh that some have complained of.

You can turn the feature off but so far I‚Äôve left it on mainly because I do read throughout the day and night and I would rather deal with the adjustment periods than reset the lighting every time.",One person found this helpful

Essentially there are two main problems with this products. And yes, they are both major flaws in my humble opinion.1. This product does not let me work with Calibre smoothly. There are many more obstacles to upload books from my library when used on my Linux machine. The device first connects, but I have just a few seconds to upload a book. If I wait, kindle oasis turns the connection off. Be aware! No good access to the storage on the device.I interpret this as a proprietary attempt to cut me from my other books besides Amazon (where I still buy a lot of e-books). Here is where oasis lost -2 stars from the review. I would never buy it if I knew this ahead of time.2. This product uses old USB plug. No USB-C connect or charge. Amazing!!! 2020 top line product from Amazon... Really a shame.-1 star for this right away.Pros:Excellent design for turning pages and both hand handle due to rotational sensitivity. Excellent readability, font choice, lights and so on. +1 star returned for its excellent design. Initially, I was skeptical about its large holding margin with two buttons. It was something I was doubtful about when I ordered oasis. However, it proved to be very convenient and well thought feature.Overall: I would NOT buy this product if I knew that they downgraded its interface compare to their paperwhite.

Don‚Äôt be fooled by these fringe users saying it doesn‚Äôt last long. My suspicion is that those people load the thing to the gills with content, and so the Kindle spends weeks or months trying to index everything, which burns a lot of battery. No one needs 10,000 books on a Kindle at one time. I‚Äôd say no one really needs more than 50. And if we‚Äôre being truly honest, 5 seems like 3 too many. You can load new books anytime, so remove the ones you aren‚Äôt going to be using in the foreseeable future. I almost didn‚Äôt buy this thing because of the reviews bashing the battery. I‚Äôve now had my Kindle for about a month. I topped it off with the charger when it first arrived. I loaded a handful of books and have left WiFi turned on. I‚Äôve read most evenings since. The battery is now at 52%. I‚Äôd say that‚Äôs pretty damned good. Also, what‚Äôs with these people demanding USB-C? It comes with a charging/data cable. It works. I couldn‚Äôt care less if it‚Äôs a USB-C or a friggin‚Äô serial port. Whatever keeps the price down is what this Kindle should have.",

I've charged it completely, then didn't charge until almost dead battery, and it last a few weeks. When wifi is on, the battery life does go down faster. But, other than that, it's great for reading your favorite books. I like how light it is, and that I can hold it in one hand and not get tired of holding the kindle.

The only thing I dont like about the Oasis is the way you save or delete books. Saving them doesn't remove the book from the page so you have to go through a ton of pages to find your next read. Deleting them is the same problem. The only way to clean up the clutter is to permanently delete them and that removes them from your cloud.

I've had annoying issues develop over the 12 1/2 months I've owned it.  1) The charging connector is loose and I have to fiddle with it to get it to charge.  This is despite buying new charging cords.  I expect that soon I won't be able to recharge.  2) The corners are now dark (or light in dark mode).  This doesn't interfere with the text, but is annoying.  3) The device becomes unresponsive on a regular basis.  Sometimes I can fix this by fully charging and then doing a restart.  Usually I do a soft reset afterwards.  For some reason the soft reset doesn't usually work until I fully recharge, restart first.  Now that strategy no longer works.

Perhaps I am missing something that I didn't do when I set up this Kindle but when I first posted a review on this Kindle at the end of reading the book, the posting only when on my Amazon account and I had to re-post manually on my Goodreads account.Aside from that, reading on this Kindle Oasis, you read as if you are reading a book with no eyestrain, plus the lighting adjusts to the lighting surrounding you physically. Page-turning is a simple flip sidewards just like a page of a book. Also even if you don't use the bookmark effect, the Kindle when awakened comes right back to the same page you were on.This is an e-reader Kindle only, it is not a tablet with apps like the Kindle Fire.",

I have been using an old charger from a Moto g5 cellphone and can recharge an almost empty Kindle battery in about an hour. When you first upload books to the kindle, the battery drains very quickly as it indexes the books - I think this has confused some people as to how long the battery lasts. Once again, my only complaint is the price. The Kindle Oasis is expensive. Buying the case was an additional $40. Buying a bag to protect it during travel was an additional $25. The charger (which is sold separately) is another $20 - as I had mentioned though, my old charger is doing a great job in its place. Bottom line, if you are someone who loves to read and does so regularly - this is a game changer. It is like carrying an entire library around with you and it is very gentle on the eyes,.. very close to reading traditional paper.",One person found this helpful

Page turn buttons and auto flip to go from right to left hand holding is a charm. Also really like the radar and character search and bookmark features. Basically really happy with purchase, expensive but worth it. I am 63 years old , wear glasses and found reading often tired my eyes a lot after an hour or so.

This is my 4th kindle and I jumped once I saw another model with physical buttons to touch to turn pages. In my opinion going away from that option is the biggest downfall in kindle design after they removed it post ‚Äúkeyboard‚Äù editions.The battery life however is abysmal. Even legacy models were, as advertised, good for weeks between charges, and that was with reading on it on a more than average basis. This Oasis with warm light however is dead inside three days with minimal use. For example, I charged it two days ago so I can read before bed. I read that night, again when I woke up in the middle of the night for a bit, same last night, and it has already died on me on the third night. I don‚Äôt use a very high backlight so it shouldn‚Äôt be draining this fast.The older paper white I had did this and a call to customer service and an update solved the battery drain but amazon has gotten so global it no longer values customer service. If I can get a person on the phone to try to troubleshoot this oasis they barely speak English and if they do are rude and dismissive and I have been disconnected each time before they tried to fix the problem.Fix what you have amazon, before trying to add more services only one or two areas have access to, or using us to underwrite more terrible amazon tv shows.

I had been thinking about the Oasis mainly because of the page turning buttons and jumped when I got a decent discount and a trade in allowance. I like the page buttons, though I sometimes forget to use them because I have been using Swipe ever since the Touch came out. Some people have been iffy about the flat screen, but I prefer it because it doesn't catch little stuff in the rim like the paperwhites. It seems smaller than my newest paperwhite, but it is just shorter and wider. I am still experimenting with the yellower pages -- which I tend to prefer even in daylight-- but it seems like a worthwhile feature. I know when I can't sleep and read my paperwhite in bed with the lights off, I need to dial down the brightness, and having that happen automatically will be great. It is pricey even with the discounts, but I am glad I got it. I also got a fintie origami cover to protect the screen from my backpack and love that it will stand up so I can read at the table while dining alone.",3 people found this helpful

And the battery life has proven to be very efficient as well lasting far longer than I would have anticipated. I also like that you can adjust the font size to a comfortable reading size and the other features such as the vocabulary builder and the highlighter, etc.I've only had mine a few days an I've already read 3 books.

I‚Äôm reading the current page through the words on the previous page, which is a might distracting.Which leads me to tonight, when my screen has developed two cracks after a short fall from a coffee table while the Oasis was it was in its protective case.I just don‚Äôt feel the Oasis is as well built as all of the prior Kindle readers.

The inconsistent battery life made me Trade in that one for the new one during Black Friday.This new version has fixed that poor battery life, at least for me.

Mine stopped working for no reason at all from sitting in my drawer, just like my kindle voyager did previously.  Amazons offer is to give me a 15% off my next purchase, 15% off something that costs $280 is barely anything.What I liked about it - I do like the wider bigger screen and the backlight, it was nice on the eyes.  I also like physical buttons, which is why I went with the Oasis however the buttons were a little loud and annoying when reading at night, also annoying the buttons are only on one side and have to keep turning the kindle around if you want to switch hands.  Bring back the Voyager!Did not Like - Well is just stopped working after a year with minimal use.  A product advertised as premium should not just die.  The metal backing definitely feels more premium however its soo slippery when holding.  I was constantly regripping when reading which was annoying.  Would it kill Amazon to put some rubber backing on it.  Also, the bevel is nice for holding but if you get a case, the case is NOT beveled, it just covers over it.  Why not create a case that has the bevel as well?  The battery on this thing also sucks, you can't really turn it off, so if you don't use it for a while, just expect it to always be dead.  At the end I think the battery is what broke the kindle.  If you're an avid reader you're probably going to have to be charging it a bit.  Considering it's just a reader the battery should be last mucchhh longer.At the end of day, the first impression was nice, I liked using it, but as time wore on, I realized the price just isn't worth the value.  You'll get the same experience on a cheaper device.  I now have had two kindles that just broke due to software updates/defects so take that as you will.",9 people found this helpful

This is my first kindle, I am an avid book reader and was against the idea of using a technical device to replace the comfort of a traditional book.

I thought I would miss the feel of a real book, however, the screen quality is so good with the warm light that it feels like a real book.  What I didn‚Äôt expect is how much more comfortable it is to read.  I always struggled with holding a large, heavy book in my hand but the kindle is so light and easy to hold that it is comfortable to read in bed or you can lay it flat on a table without worrying that the pages will flip over inadvertently. The oasis makes it so easy to turn the pages at the touch of a button.

I bought it because I wanted to do what I can do on my phone; which is immersion reading. The fact that this device costs $250 and can't do something as basic as the free Kindle app can do on a phone with immersion reading, knocks off three stars in my opinion. 'Tis my fault for not researching this device better before tossing my money into the fire, but here we are.I don't see anything about this device that warrants the need to purchase such an expensive device when the other cheaper kindles are just as good and capable of reading a book, if you want to read a book on a Kindle device, just save your money and buy the cheaper kindles. The fact that this device can play audiobooks is absolutely moot when a smartphone is already capable of doing such. I bought this device because I wanted to LISTEN while READING on a screen that was NOT a smartphone screen. If audiobooks are your thing, instead of sinking $250 on this device, spend $250 on audiobooks, and use your smartphone for free.Even if audiobooks and reading Kindle books are what you want to do. You're still better off spending your money on a cheaper Kindle and using the free Kindle app for audiobooks on your phone.The Oasis Kindle only allows you to either read or listen. But not both at the same time. So again.. I don't see what this device is supposed to cater to or what its selling point is. If the selling point is listening to audiobooks, my smartphone is already capable of doing that, and for free with Kindle's very own app.But alas, for whatever reason, the big-heads at Amazon decided such a thing shall not exist, we can't have people listening and reading at the same time on Kindle. So I don't understand why this kindle even exists. It's just a money drain with moot features.Ah, the light feature is kind of nice.

The kindle took about a week to arrive, and during this waiting period, I used to the kindle app on my tablet to read. It hurt my eyes, I felt like I couldn't focus, and I read much slower than I ever did with physical books. I began to wonder if I'd made a mistake in order the kindle. But when it arrived, the difference in the experience between the tablet and the kindle was amazing. It didn't hurt my eyes and I was back to reading as quickly as ever.

However, this year for my birthday I got a couple Amazon gift cards and I thought what the hell? I've been trying to downsize my actual book collection and I think this is a good alternative. I went with the Oasis because of the size and look. As someone who is particular about asthetics, I knew I definitely didn't want the traditional (albeit cheaper) Kindle. This works out perfectly. I like the way it fits in my hand, it's like holding a small book. Not too heavy or light. It's very easy to read from without fear of a glare. I use dark mode on this 99% of the time because that's my personal preference. I also utilize an app called Libby that allows me to check out books from my local library system and read on my Kindle. I'm really enjoying it. Now if I could just find more time to read all the books... :)",One person found this helpful

I use the inverted color feature and the warm lights to put less stress on my eyes. I also love the 7‚Äù screen size and how clear it is to see every word. The screen size makes it seem like you‚Äôre reading an actual paperback or small hardcover book. I also really like the background texture that seems to mimic an actual page on a book. I‚Äôve heard/read mixed reviews on this feature and how the voyage has more contrast and looks clearer. I believe that‚Äôs what some people don‚Äôt like about to be oasis. However, in my opinion If you want a clearer display without that page texture then just stick with a tablet. Kindle oasis makes it feel like you‚Äôre reading an actual book not just words on an electronic device.What I don‚Äôt like about the kindle is that the battery does seem to drain rather quick but not too quickly. After a full charge and reading for about 2 hours my battery was at a 90%.

But this was a workhorse device - it went through he paces (travels, etc) but still never any problems!I was surprised at how much I loved the format.  It is perfect for the person that likes to hand-hold the device while reading.  I can switch from hand to hand - and the image flips as needed.  I also liked the buttons to change pages.Additionally, the lighting is great!  You can customize it to whatever works for you.I am disappointed in a couple of things.One the touch screen gets wonky sometimes - and I regularly have to restart my device - which I hardly ever had to do with my previous device.But the thing, I really dislike and I am most frustrated with is the battery life.  I will do my evening reading with a 99% charged device.  In the morning the device is between 45-65%.  It advertises weeks of battery life - I am lucky if I get two days.  It is so different from what is in the sale literature - it feels like it is false advertising.But overall I am happy - just not sure how long it will last with such a short battery life.",2 people found this helpful

I'm a traditional book type of person and don't really like reading on a screen, but this new Kindle Oasis is so different from other devices I've used. The adjustable warm light can be adjusted to where it looks like real paper from a book making it easier on the eyes. As for holding it, I like the raised back but it is a very slippery device with being aluminum. I ended up sticking a pop-gripper on the back of the raised area and it's perfect. Other than that, I love it. The battery life seems to be holding pretty well but I don't see it lasting weeks if you're a frequent reader as advertised. It's not bad, but while reading one afternoon for a few hours, the battery life dropped nearly 20% which is fine, but at that rate it would have only lasted about a day if I read from morning to night. Again, not an issue with me as I don't read for more than two hours or so at a time. In the end, these things don't bother me and I am one happy camper. I love it!",2 people found this helpful

Books that according to the people in charge of updates now say is the problem.  I have too many books.  Before the newest update which now shows book covers instead of or in addition to the title my Kindle worked just fine- now with the addition of unnecessary graphics the Oasis can't handle the load.  You would think the developers would have given the user the option to continue with the simple ""list view""  but no, they have not. Given that the device is advertised to have 32 GB of storage and I have 25.98 GB free- how can the number of books be an issue?  The changes that have been made make it impossible to use Collections as they were before- now it's either only show Collections or show them mixed in with your books and still list all of the books that are in your collections.  I never thought I would say this but- I can't recommend the purchase of any of the line of Kindle devices since they all have the new update.",4 people found this helpful

I like that I can use buttons to turn pages instead of having to touch the screen (which you can still do). The responsiveness of the screen to touch seems to be more accurate with this version, as well.If you're looking for a device that addresses nits you had to pick with the PaperWhite such as brightness, weight, and page render times, this device addresses the PaperWhite's shortcomings.

I also bought the blue color fabric cover, it's really outstanding among other electronic devices, also it is designed for oasis which accommodates the bezel.

Otherwise, I am constantly inadvertently turning pages. It would be great if just the page-turn parts of the screen could be turned off, so you could still touch the top to get into settings  or touch words to highlight/look up and so forth.

I traded in my old Voyage, which I loved, but figured it was worth it to get the latest and greatest for an appealing price.  I‚Äôm an avid reader with almost 1,000 books in my kindle library, and have owned seven of the various earlier Kindle versions.  After anxiously awaiting my new kindle oasis, and being without a kindle due to sending my Voyage in for the trade in, I received my package two days ago. After an hour or so of customizing the screen, I had a terrible headache, but thought I‚Äôd just overdone it. After resting my eyes I tried reading on it, and again my eyes and head ached after a short time. A few more attempts, along with some adjustments to font and font size, and I realized the problem lay in the color of the text - it‚Äôs a gray scale, not a true black, and was causing eye strain. There is no way to adjust the font color, just the background. Reluctantly I returned it, and am now purchasing a used Voyage from amazon, as I can‚Äôt get my old Voyage back from the trade in department, even though I tried.Many things about the Oasis are wonderful, and I‚Äôm really bummed it doesn‚Äôt work for me. The feel, weight, page display, sleekness of it are enormously appealing, but if I can‚Äôt read on it, it‚Äôs useless. Please, Amazon, consider this for future iterations, and when this problem is solved I‚Äôll be right back in line to purchase another one.",2 people found this helpful
Kindle Oasis ‚Äì With 7‚Äù display and page turn buttons,5.0,BEST KINDLE YET,"Reviewed in the United States on November 8, 2019",Digital Storage Capacity: 8 GB | Offer Type: Lockscreen Ad-Supported | Color: Graphite | Option: Without Kindle Unlimited,True,"Honestly, this is my all time favorite e-reader so far. I've been a Kindle fan since the keyboard reader Kindle offered.I had the most recent Paperwhite and decided to just jump at the chance when they introduced this newest one.It's amazing. Even the Paperwhite gave me a headache after hours, but this is perfect for very VERY long reading stretches.It's so big, but small enough to be comfortable in your hand, and the fact that you can rotate it/use the buttons to change the page, make lying down in bed to read even more convenient.I do agree with a lot of people about making your charger a lightning or USB-C, because it would create a more versatile electronic, but it does not deter from my 5 star rating at all.I have gone with the leather case that's around forty dollars for the past couple of kindles and I will never buy anything else. It's a bit of a price just to chew on, but it's worth it. It feels perfect in my hands and on the Kindle, unlike other cheaper cases I have tested out.",One person found this helpful

Warm light feature is just amazing and allows for less strain on the eyes.2. The asymmetric back design makes it so much easier to hold in one hand and turn the pages at the same time than the Paperwhite.  I always felt like my Paperwhite was falling out of my hand when I tried to read one-handed.  No such problem with the Oasis.3.  Slightly wider screen makes it feel more like you are reading a paperback book.Totally worth the extra money in my opinion.  I don't believe I will ever need another ereader after this.  I highly recommend it to anyone considering making the switch.",

It‚Äôs so light I don‚Äôt even know I‚Äôm holding anything.  I am able to easily balance the Oasis on my pinky finger, and it‚Äôs still light as a feather!  Even after hours of reading my hand does not cramp.The screen size is perfect for me, even though the device size is relatively small in the hand. The amber light is comfortable to read on and perfect before bedtime since it eliminates blue light.Amazon should include a USB C charging port. Micro usb is outdated and going away. No excuse for this. The Oasis is expensive. If your going to pay this much for an ereader, get the 32GB version and be done with it.I‚Äôm glad I bought the Oasis.

I haven‚Äôt charged my Oasis in about 2 weeks and still have about 30% battery life. Kindle will last a lot longer in airplane mode.The oasis automatically updates your Goodreads profile which is a plus. No more manually work.One of the disappointing things for me was the text to speech. It‚Äôs harder to navigate on the new device. In fact, everything is harder to navigate while using the voice function.I read a lot but sometimes it‚Äôs nice to turn on the text to speech option and let the device read to me, especially when I‚Äôm listening to my audible books.I was also hoping to have a bigger screen.

I very much like the auto-adapting LED colour, which makes it much easier to read in low-light. The screen is lit more evenly too with the extra LEDs on the device.  I don‚Äôt use the audible functionality yet since I run all of my audible books off of my iPhone, so I can‚Äôt comment on that.The biggest win from my upgrade was the slightly wider screen, it doesn‚Äôt seem like much but it feels like I‚Äôm page turning quite a bit less. Try to get through at least a book a week, and for me, this screen makes it so much more comfortableIn summary. Reasons I think it was a worthwhile upgrade are; backlight; yellow screen; bigger screen; That might not be enough for everyone, especially given the expense of the item, but for me, I find myself reading more because of these (minor?) improvements over the paperwhite.",

So I figured it was time for an upgrade to the oasis. First of all, it‚Äôs a beautiful product. Lightweight, clear screen, adjustable backlight which helps when my eyes are tired. Goes from a grayish to a warm brown color. Brightness can be adjusted too. My one complaint is that it is designed to be held in your right hand only. The border of the kindle is only on the right side so it‚Äôs a little awkward when you want to switch hands or hold from the bottom. There isn‚Äôt enough of a border to do that. Granted you can turn the kindle upside down but that can get annoying after a while. I haven‚Äôt tried that yet but I had read from other reviews that you can do that.

Kindle Oasis ‚Äì With 7‚Äù display and page turn buttons,2.0,My Nightmare in the Oasis,"Reviewed in the United States üá∫üá∏ on December 5, 2020",Digital Storage Capacity: 32 GB | Offer Type: Lockscreen Ad-Supported | Color: Champagne Gold | Option: Without Kindle Unlimited,True,"I have owned Kindles since I retired back in 2010.  My first was the Keyboard Kindle that I love and still use, but after almost 10 years I thought it time to get an updated piece of equipment.  I struggled for days to decide between the Oasis or the Paperwhite, finally settling on the Oasis.Since receiving the Oasis I can categorically state that the last time I felt this kind of frustration was with my first dealing with the DOS prompts of my early computers.  This unit is the least intuitive piece of electronics I have ever had to deal with‚Ä¶ even after the unit was replaced, I am dealing with the same problems that the original was replaced for.  The touchscreen may advance 1 page or 20, or anywhere in between, and the problem seems even worse when going backward.  With my Keyboard Kindle I need only press the home button and all my options lie before me‚Ä¶ but with the Oasis that same function is a pipedream.  So, there is a function that turns off the touch screen allowing only the forward/backward buttons to turn pages‚Ä¶ but then your access to the dictionary or other functions are turned off as well.  I will continue to use this device with a hate/love relationship, but others should know that the use of the Oasis is at best frustrating, at worst maddening!Calling for help, you are immediately connected to a representative, and that is a plus‚Ä¶ but the likelihood is that your Representative lacks the ability to speak English as their primary language.  That sounds bigoted, but I am 69 years old, living in the Upper Mid-West with little interaction with folks from foreign lands, so it is what it is‚Ä¶ I need Representatives that speak English as their first language, (and bless their hearts, the reps that tried to help me really did try to help).

Kindle Oasis ‚Äì With 7‚Äù display and page turn buttons,2.0,I returned and kept my Paperwhite,"Reviewed in the United States üá∫üá∏ on January 27, 2020",Digital Storage Capacity: 8 GB | Offer Type: Lockscreen Ad-Supported | Color: Graphite | Option: Without Kindle Unlimited,True,"I've had my Paperwhite for over four years. The main reason I looked at upgrading was to have the warm light option on the Oasis. When reading my Paperwhite in the dark, one light setting was just a little too bright for my eyes, but the next setting down made it a little too hard to read the text. I also missed the buttons to turn the pages that were on the old keyboard version. With a trade-in for my Paperwhite and 20% off a new Kindle, I figured it was a good time to upgrade. I used the Oasis for about two weeks and decided to return it and keep my Paperwhite.I did like the warm light option, but it took a while adjusting the two colors to easily read at night, making it light enough and warm enough at the same time.The battery life was terrible. I waited for all my books to be downloaded/synced, as I knew that would use up the battery. But when it was all updated, even overnight it used 10% of the battery. And I had the official Amazon/Kindle cover that is supposed to put it to sleep. It used a good 20% of the battery reading for only about an hour with medium lights.The size was very awkward. It is more square, whereas real books and the Paperwhite are rectangular. You're used to holding a book that sits portrait and how its weight is distributed. It was a little less awkward to hold without the cover on, but I always have the cover on. And when the cover is flipped back, you don't get the benefit of having the ergonomic bump out part.The page turn buttons were a little small, so you had to position your hand just right to not have to move a lot to turn the pages. I felt like the keyboard version had better placed/sized buttons.I returned it mainly because of the poor battery life and the awkward size. It was more of a chore to hold than my Paperwhite, and I didn't want to constantly have to charge it. And considering the high price of an Oasis, it wasn't worth it for me. Maybe a Paperwhite with a warm light option would be a good compromise for me. I'll wait to see what new versions are in store.",

Well I am so glad I purchased it.  The 7 inch screen makes a big difference it reading easiness and pleasure.  Also love the lighting and the page turn buttons.  It is so much easier to press the button that doing the touch or sweep to turn the page.  The feel of holding it is also way better.  I don't know why I waited so long.  Well I got a 20% trade in credit and a $20 gift card so that helped my decision too.  The battery life appears to be okay.  If you have wi-fi constantly on it will drain the battery fast.

I read a lot at the beach & late at night in bed. This handles both well. The warmness orange setting is quite pleasant.- The onboard storage is great, big enough for loads of books.Cons: - My biggest gripe, the battery life. I have it set to Airplane mode, Bluetooth off, & still find myself needing to charge it at least once a week; I'd say I read about 15 hours a week. I am guilty of falling asleep with it on, but still, you'd expect a little more from the outrageous 'weeks of battery life' Amazon claims its capable of.- Micro USB.

Was very disappointed, so much so I just started the return process.  It wasn't the price, I got $70 off on prime day, then purchased a cover also on sale.  It was the following:1. Audible integration was very poor, the Audible app on my Android phone is better. The app for phone has many more features . Found myself reaching for cell to listen to a book with the Oasis right next to me.2. Forward and back buttons not well thought out. holding the Oasis with right hand i have to reach over the back button (hardly ever used) to reach the forward button (used to turn every page) you can't swap button function. so i constantly drop the Oasis.  You can disable the buttons then you have to reach about 2 inches to tap the screen. Paperwhite page turning much better.3.Auto brightness works but wasn't a problem with Paperwhite.  I set the brightness for low lit room most the time, if I am outside i adjust it once.4. Battery life, My experience 2 weeks with Paperwhite, 5 days with Oasis. this wasn't a big deal i am always near a charger within 5 days. The battery life was probably affected by changing base brightness and the yellowing of pages often while testing.5. Charging. Why USB-Micro Vs USB-C. would prefer USB-C to match  Headphones and Cell. Why not include a USB-micro to USB-C adapter for existing charging cable with Oasis and use USB-C. Again not a big deal.6.

It‚Äôs like Netflix for book, no every title is available but there is a decent selection to choose form.

My point is, I've had several and  this one rates only OK.I was really looking forward to the biased weight to the palm but the ""edge/grip"" is too smooth, it's harder to hold.

Being able to adjust the warm light makes such a significant difference reading in varying lighting conditions.  The screen continues to look crisp and clear, but now it can actually look like paper (with some minor adjustments).  Beyond happy with this purchaseMy only wish is that whisper sync were more affordable.  it feels like a lot of $ to drop in order to take advantage of this service.  Especially because they have discontinued the kindle match program.  come on Amazon, we are clearly throwing money into the system, make it a bit more accessible.",

I had really liked that kindle but I wanted to upgrade for the warm light feature. That feature was an upgrade be the downside is that the battery life on this is significantly worse. To be clear, it still lasts a long time, but not as long as the voyager did.A big disappointment I have with the Oasis is the VoiceView option. The feature is extremely difficult to use. Everything is double taps and swipes, but I find that it doesn't really work. I find myself poking at the screen multiple times and end up having to restart the kindle to disable the feature. It's bad. Really, really, bad. If you are purchasing a kindle for the read aloud feature - don't. You will be disappointed. That's a shame because the feature has potential. I'd like to have it enabled so my son can have the kindle read a difficult word aloud (not the whole book, just a word), but the navigation is so difficult that it makes the feature beyond useless.I wish the kindle would allow ""immersive reading"", where I could listen to the audible version and read along, but that's not possible either.Overall, as a basic ereader, this thing is great. However, the ""extra"" features that could make it even better feel like a 'beta' version. It's not yet good enough for a five start rating.",6 people found this helpful

I landed on the Kindle Oasis and if my dad didn't show me his kindle fire I would've settled for this overpriced, mediocre, incompetent product. Right off the bat, it's slow, it's in black & white, the screen never completely shuts off (w/ the ad version), the battery drains super fast, and the cover you buy for it is way overpriced. Now if this model is all you know then this is fine. BUT I shortly found out after about the Kindle Fire series and my god I wish I found it sooner. I travel everyday on planes for work so investing in an e-reader was mandatory for me. The main reason people buy the Oasis is for the warm light feature which the Kindle Fire series has. The Kindle Fire is like buying an Ipad for less than 150$. It's almost half the price as the Oasis and has triple the features (kindle, audible, vivid colors, different highlighting colors, easy to navigate, fast operation, apps for streaming, social media apps, games, photo storage, etc). After experiencing my Kindle Fire I really don't know why someone would rather pay for the Oasis. It also comes in different sizes which the kindle oasis does not. The oasis' defining features are the fact it's lightweight, has buttons to turn the pages, and it's easy to navigate. Even if you are looking for JUST an e-reader I still wouldn't recommend the Oasis. You can just buy the Kindle Fire and uninstall the distracting apps or just get your favorite model of the paperwhite if you don't like colors.",7 people found this helpful

While I am not crazy about ads in general, I am getting VERY aggravated with the ads trying to sell me what I consider to be SOFT PORN romances.

You can click on ""Your library"" and see all of your titles listed without thumbnail and for some reason I can see those titles a bit better, but even there - no option to increase the font size so that the titles are more easily read.I won't be buying any of their recommended books based on my interests, my reading, my last book or top page turners because I can't see any of them.Once I get to the book, the reading fonts and sizes are FANTASTIC.

I tried Oasis because everyone raved about the build quality and how fast the refresh rate is and how great the buttons are.Really???  I was completely underwhelmed by this, full stop.Refresh rate was horrible - if you want to use this to add highlights or notes, forget it.  And if you are even remotely visually-challenged as I am, note this:  every time you touch the top to access the menu, the contrast inverts for a second.  It did this in every mode I tried.  I called Amazon support and that was a joke.  They couldn't even tell me if this was normal behavior or not.Also, on maximum brightness, it wasn't nearly bright enough for me.In short... if you can't tolerate GIFs (because of your vision, not because they are usually so stupid) then avoid this.I would expect this quality (including a micro USB charger??  it's 2021) would be worth about $80 - $100 - NO MORE THAN THAT.  If you're OK spending $260 on this, bump up to $329 and get a new 10.2 inch retina display iPad and get the Kindle app to read your books.  That's what I just did and WOW what a joy to read!!!  SO bright, instant refresh, easy to take notes and highlight (even using your voice so you don't have to type your notes) and so much more.  PLUS it does about a million other things too.  As much as I felt the Oasis is over-priced for what it is, I feel the iPad is under-priced for what it is.This was definitely not for me.  Returned.  I know I'm obviously in the minority here, but I wanted to share my honest experience.",

Biggest problem:  I am 73 and a voracious reader.  My fingers and hands also have some arthritis.  It is hard to hold this new Kindle Oasis because there are no places to hold it without unwittingly touching the screen and thus turning the page.  The Oasis does have one Side with the page turning buttons which makes easier to hold on the right side.  Thus I don't understand why a side can't be bigger on the left.  THE COVERS AVAILABLE DO NOT ADDRESS THIS PROBLEM.2. Second problem:Sorting Feature-  I have over a thousand books on the device or in the cloud.  I like Collections, but they are not easy to retrieve.  I have to page through 70 pages to get to Woods, Stuart.  Especially when trying to add books to a collection3. Third problem: Receiving books I have ordered months earlier.  Today, I knew I should have JD Robb's newest IN Death.  However it was not on my home screen like before, when books would be delivered seamlessly.  When I went to Recent -Unread, it still wasn't there.  I had to go to the store.  Look it up.

So that‚Äôs one star off the review. The more egregious reason another star comes off are the statements around battery life (‚Äúweeks not hours‚Äù). Somehow, those must have been tested by daylight, without backlights - and they must assume people don‚Äôt read for more than 15 minutes a day. My brand-new, fully charged battery is good for maybe 3-4 days. I read a lot (about 5hrs/day) and do most of it after sunset (so with backlights on). After eight hours of reading in two days, the battery is at 52%. I bought this mainly for the battery life.Overall I like the device just about enough to keep it (you know, 3 stars).

This is the primary reason I bought this device.2) The warmer light option - especially as I like to read before my bed time.However it fell short of my expectation due to:1) It is too heavy to hold in one hand when reading in bed  (it is partially the trade off for the larger screen - I know that -  but partially due to the aluminum frame)2) Sharp edges of the aluminum case.  This was suppose to give it the luxury feeling, but when I am holding it in one hand while reading, those sharp edges starts to really hurt me after a while.Eventually I taped the entire reader with first aid tape, so I am now able to hold it for longer, so really only the the weight is the main issue for me, but in my opinion a lighter plastic case (with rounder edges) would make it a much better device!",One person found this helpful

The first I bought for my wife. Hers worked well and she's been very satisfied with it. Based on that I bought one for myself. I should add that we've both had Kindles going back over 10 years. Our reason for going to the Oasis was for the push-button page turners and the larger screen. The latter is not larger enough to make much of a differenceThe Oasis I got turned out to have a problem with the page turners: unpredictably, it would cause the reader to freeze up, so that nothing worked for 10-15 seconds, then it would recover. Or I could close the cover or shut it off with the switch, then back on, and it would work again.. I returned the unit as defective and got a replacement  with no questions asked. The replacement did exactly the same thing, so I returned that and got another replacement. Again, no questions asked and no explanations given. The 3rd one, I inadvertently kept the 3rd one more than 30 days, so I'm stuck with it.Other than that, the micro-USB has been objected to by many reviewers, as has the slippery nature of the unit without a cover and its clumsy shape. We haven't found the shorter battery life to be a problem , but we don't travel any more and simply plug them in at bedtime.  We both like the increased adjustability of the backlighting.On the whole, we don't think the Oasis is worth the extra cost over that of the Paperwhite.",One person found this helpful

Not only do I still not like this unit, I like it even less than when I first received it and over the last years my opinion hasn't changed.  Battery life is not as poor as I first thought but still abysmal when compared to my 2011 Kindle.  Worst is the weight of the battery to the one side which makes it feel unbalanced and uncomfortable to hold; my hand and wrist tend to cramp and I have to keep shifting hands and adjusting my hold.  It keeps trying to apply the moronic ""time left in chapter"" and I have to reset my preference on each new book and even during books I have already set.  And apparently software updates come along changing how the main screen sets up and I have to play around with it to try to return it to something close to my preferred view.  I am in the middle of one of those episodes right now, hence my irritation and further updating this review.What do I like?  That I can chose which page turn button is forward and that the screen (and coordinating button) reverses when I flip it.  But that is not an advantage per se, but rather a necessity resulting from the rest of the crummy design.  Changeable font size is wonderful but so expected it is nothing to be especially proud of.Buy the online Amazon Content and Devices screen is really stupid.  Why would I buy a device capable of holding thousands of books and then have to scroll through the 25 at a time when online.  Big deal it gives me pictures...they sacrificed function for looks.

Eventually it starts to flicker and even if you turn off the light completely, it will soon either fails entirely or the screen gets messed up or something else goes wrong -- the power button stopped working on the last one, bricking it.The average lifespan of my devices has been about 6 months.The important thing to know about customer support is that Amazon's warranty countdown transfers to replacement devices after one fails -- it doesn't start over.  So you really only have the one year from initial purchase and after that they wash their hands of it, even if it fails and they send you a replacement device.  The replacement's warranty ends when the original device would have, so they don't care if it fails in three months (like my most recent one.)Also, you should be aware that they will send you a refurb as a replacement, not a new unit.  After my first warranty expired I got a discount on a new unit in the hopes that they had fixed the problems.  Fool me once, shame on you.  Fool me twice, shame on me.  I won't be trying that again.BTW, I reported the hardware issues to Amazon after the first one failed and they created a bug report and everything for the hardware team, including having me download log files from the device.  Obviously they never fixed the issue but I mention it to let you know that I genuinely wanted to make these things work.  Amazon does not appear to care whether they work for very long, though.

I admit, I read a ton of books from Kindle Unlimited on this, so there are times it went fast, but it all seemed reasonable depending on the hours I read and the brightness of the screen that I used at that time.It charges quickly, and the ""warm"" light feature has reduced eyestrain when reading in bed with the lights out.It also seems lighter than the paperwhite I had, which is an added plus.I also splurged for the leather cover, which has held up nicely.Overall, a very nice device that I would recommend to others.",

The device is very quick and snappy.  The lighting is 5 stars.  The buttons have a nice click feel to them.  It feels so nice in the hand (no case).  Now, for the warm lighting.  It has improved an already incredible device even better.  Please reference my 3 pics showing the warmer tones.  One pic shows the lighting levels for all 3 pics.  It is definitely easier on the eyes and makes the black text stand out even more.  The screen is very sharp and crisp.  The lighting setting in the pics mimics the color of pages in a hardback novel.  No more harsh blue light for me.

Turns the light orange, and I don't mean a subtle warm white... ORANGE. Sometimes with this setting on the display will blink back to white light in the midst of a page flip or such. Ruins whatever vibe this mode tries to convey.The metal and glass construction, while more premium, ends up being more of a cold nuisance. And forget about tossing it around as casually as you did the paperwhite. The ""ergonomic"" battery bump hurts ergonomics, if you can even hold onto it with the slippery metal backside, and the buttons are a stretch in some hand holds. I've taken to using a phone ring grip and at least the screen auto-rotates quickly when you switch hands.This may end up as a gift to someone while I buy another Paperwhite on the down low",One person found this helpful

It didn‚Äôt at all appear artificially-lit - it‚Äôs the strangest thing. I can‚Äôt even tell it‚Äôs backlit, because it adjusts to the perfect brightness for the light level in my room.I was also skeptical of the Oasis design, given that it‚Äôs thicker on one side and thinner on the other.

Excellent.  I had the 2nd gen and 3rd gen side by side, and the 3rd generation is faster and more responsive than any kindle I have ever seen.  The 2nd gen Oasis wasn't slow, but this new one is incredibly snappy.  I wasn't really familiar with the warm light effect, so I wasn't sure if that was something to be excited about.

I was on the fence for quite some time about buying the new Kindle Oasis 2019. I thought my Voyage was good enough for me to enjoy reading and there was no need for an upgrade, I was wrong. The new Kindle Oasis is a major step up in terms of functionality and design. Reading is more comfortable with the Oasis body, and I really like the ability to adjust the screen ‚Äúwarmth‚Äù which makes it an even more enjoyable reading experience. You can also flip the unit and read in either hand or leverage the physical page turn buttons, another benefit for those long reading sessions. Yes it‚Äôs a little more expensive than some of the other models but if you are a voracious reader, this is worth the cost without question.

I have read multiple books and can honestly say I like it just as much as reading physical copies, especially at night! The warm light is amazing and I find it is much easier to fall asleep than reading with a book light. I also have been able to read books from my Libby app, by sending it to my kindle. It was incredibly easy to do, without any technical knowledge needed. This is my first kindle, so I can't compare to previous/cheaper models. The battery does not last weeks as advertised with normal use (for me 3 to 4 hours a day minimum), only days (about 5 days in my experience). But over all, I am extremely pleased with my purchase, despite the initial buyer's remorse/guilt I felt after paying nearly $300 for a ""simple"" e-reader vs a versatile tablet.",

The combination of the big screen, warm light, and buttons, make this (in my opinion) a great replacement for books, while replicating the real thing. You can adjust the warm light just enough to make it look like a page - and turn it up a little more, if you like the replication of an older book. Even though its really expensive its worth it - the oasis is superior to the paperwhite if you want a closer experience to a real book - and its a joy to hold. By the way I used to have a paperwhite and its collecting dust now. The only thing I would note about what i actually don't like about this thing is the metal casing is a little slippery, but it actually doesn't bother me while i'm reading because when you are reading a real book with one hand anyway you make adjustments with the placement of your hand every now and then.

Battery life seems a little shorter than the Paperwhite.

The Oasis can automatically switch to night-time lighting automatically based on your schedule.  Very cool.Another feature I really appreciate is the ability to select font size using the sliding scale.  The Paperwhite had preset font sizes which were OK.

I had a popsocket on my Paperwhite and it was so light and easy to hold.With all that extra weight, you'd think the battery would last forever...but it drains faster than a beer bong at a frat party.  I used to only charge my Paperwhite once every few weeks.  I can drain the Oasis in two days of ""heavy"" (ha! Like a total of 6-8 hours is reading.) I tried to be patient, rhinking it was due to it indexing, but it didn't improve after weeks of use, adding only a new book every now and then.  I keep my font size small, I have my backlight kept at a 3.  It'll last a little longer on airplane mode, but it's insane that I have to change my usage patterns to help keep a ""superior"" device happy.The Paperwhite was an amazing ebook reader and the battery lasted forever.

Personal preference.  My fingers were never handily stationed there and too easy to move in either direction too fast while adjusting my position.  Then, I would end up on a random page.  With ipad I simply touched screen.I unfortunately, I dropped oasis on concrete face down with cover on (hint:  invest in durable but soft cover...not hard plastic).  Put two cracks in it.  Wasn't fixable.  Back to drawing board and bought Paperwhite with docking station.  I set it up in seconds and found the controls very user friendly and comparable to ipad.  Relief!Upshot:  Don't bother with newer expensive generations...this does absolutely everything you need with fewer awkward formats in settings and page turning.",
Kindle Oasis ‚Äì With 7‚Äù display and page turn buttons,5.0,Used for management of PTSD panic attacks.,"Reviewed in the United States üá∫üá∏ on February 15, 2020",Digital Storage Capacity: 32 GB | Offer Type: Lockscreen Ad-Supported | Color: Champagne Gold | Option: Without Kindle Unlimited,True,"I use this to stop panic attacks when they happen, since reading on this is immersive enough to take my mind off of whatever the trigger was THAT time.  Recommended by the therapists at the VA in Iowa City, and works pretty freaking well.  Nice to have an option for PTSD that is NOT some kind of pill!  Since the panic attacks can happen at any time, the amber glow that you can use at night is fantastic - when I was using my old Paperwhite to do this I‚Äôd end up staying awake for another couple hours after the attack ended just because of the blueish glow from that.  Now I can cut off the attack, read for another few minutes to make sure it‚Äôs really gone, then put the book down and go back to sleep.  I swear, the VA should be handing these things out more than the pills.  Screw Ativan, gimme a Kindle!",One person found this helpful

When holding the Oasis, if you barely touch the side of the screen, the page will turn.  I do really like the weight and the buttons.

Bummer.Other than that upgrades over the 9th gen are pretty minimal.  The warm light is nice, but kinda underwhelming.

Also, the blue light blocking yellow does not get as yellow as it shows in the picture. With the ""Warmth"" setting as high as it will go it's only a little darker than white and not really yellow.

The only thing I don't like about it is that the battery life isn't as good as my older Paperwhite. It only seem to last a couple of weeks with only reading an hour or less a day.

All the other devices in our home work just fine. I called Amazon, who told me to call our Internet Provider. After spending an hour on the phone with Xfinity, they determined that our network was fine, but that it was the kindle device. I called Amazon back. I was connected to someone in another country whose English was virtually impossible to understand. Additionally, the background noise was so loud that it made what little English was spoken difficult to hear. The service tech, ""Rap"". was incredibly rude, as if it was my fault it wasn't working.

It is also incredibly easy to use the library ebook rental service, Overdrive, to send free ebook rentals directly to the kindle eReader. I also love the software on the Kindle (which I'm sure is not unique to this particular model).

For the money I should not have to go by a case so it doesn't slip off my lap.  The Oasis doesn't offer enough over the paperwhite to justify the additional price.  The grip can be utilized with either hand as the screen will automatically rotate the print BUT the one direction it should rotate it doesn't.  If you set it down on a table and try to have the handle flat on the table so the device tilts towards you it doesn't rotate the print, common really.  For this price it should be a lot better.  It is a fine reader, but so isn't the paperwhite which i am going to return to. I am going to give this away before it falls of my lap and breaks.",

I am very happy with the image quality. It approximates a paper book more than any other electronic device I ever held (various iPhones, iPads and Kindles). I was hoping that it will be very comfortable to hold in one (large) hand due to its ridged design on the back. However I don‚Äôt find that ridge helpful. The wider black margin does help though. So I can read with one hand if I keep my middle or second finger between the front and back cover with thumb on the black margin, using my thumb to push the buttons. Switching to left hand is very intuitive, you rotate the Kindle 180 to grab it by the wide margin, the text assumes the proper orientation immediately and the top button will be moving the pages forward just like in right handed mode.",

I‚Äôm not sure about their claim to the battery life though. While it is excellent, it‚Äôs not weeks of battery like they claim it is. With about an hour and a half of reading 4 days a week I get about a week and a half between charges. So if you‚Äôre an avid reader unlike me you won‚Äôt get that much.

That being said, for $250 you should be getting a lot more. It is quite slow. My $50 backup smartphone is faster and more responsive. There's really no excuse for its lack of power. It makes certain tasks, like browsing the store, fairly annoying. It's also incredibly delicate feeling. I feel like it's just going to snap in half if I grip it a little too hard.

I love the larger screen. The screen itself is so sensitive that I find myself mistakenly changing the page setting to something else. The extra memory was needed; otherwise, I would have kept my Voyage and been content with it. And, by the way, I like the buttons on the Voyage better than these actual buttons on the Oasis.CONS:  I‚Äôm not happy with the on/off button as I really liked where it was located on my Voyage (that‚Äôs going to my best friend). The ergonomic handle doesn‚Äôt work for me due to my arthritis and fibromyalgia, so I suggest that anyone having similar illnesses order a cover. My hands, not small by any means, finds it awkward to hold without a cover; so awkward that I wasn‚Äôt expecting this. Lastly, the USB port seems wonky: the charging cable doesn‚Äôt attach easily.I think that, with time, I‚Äôll come to love it, but for now, if it didn‚Äôt have the extra memory and the warmth settings, I would say that they need to bring the Voyage back.",One person found this helpful

Not all of my collections transferred, for no reason that anyone can tell me.  So, I am having to rebuild them manually in the new Kindle and that is a pain.  Collections are the only way to make sense of the many books I have on Kindle and, if Collections don't work properly, I am at a loss.  I sorely wish Amazon would invest a little in this process.  You can put a new Samsung tablet down next to an older one and everything seamlessly transfers over.  Not so with Kindle.  Also, I would love a better, easier way to organize books.  Why can't Amazon make a virtual library with shelves that I could put books on in the order I want and easily re-arrange when I want?  Plus that I could browse easily?  Just wishing.

I like the option of buttons for turning pages, and the wider non-screen area to hold the device. I had planned to use it without a cover, but I did not like the cold feel of the metal back. Adding even a very slim cover, defeats the slim profile and the bump on the back which makes holding comfortable. I can't really evaluate the adjustable warm light, as I don't notice it. I tend to like a brighter page. I already had a Kindle Paperwhite. I consider the Oasis a luxury, not a necessary upgrade, considering the price and that I don't plan to use it near water.

The clarity of fonts and screen light - that keeps changing slowly based on external lighting without disturbing. I have been reading on paperwhite for several years. For a happy paperwhite user there may not be great reason to upgrade. We can read in paperwhite for several hours without strain but oasis is definitely better on eyes. It also has auto rotation to help right and left handed persons alike. With a larger screen there is rarely an incentive to go to landscape mode. PDFs are better visible but it still depends on specific PDFs how they would be viewable. While most persons would be discouraged with the price differential, this may be an acceptable upgrade if you read a lot and a discerning reader would appreciate the difference in reading ease.

I would expect to see USB-C at this stage in the game (the spec itself was published in 2014 and usb-c as a connector has been mainstream since 2016). Manufacturers need to get on board and support a single standard (Amazon isn't the only one to blame). One star removed.I was also disappointed to see a cheap cable, but no wall-wart charger. Really? For a $300 device? One star removed.I can appreciate the size, and the warm lighting, and the aluminum chassis but is that enough to warrant the price difference from the current waterproof paperwhite? Right now, I'm not going to say it is. I may change my tune as I read more with the amber light, but the lighting seems like the only additional feature over the current paperwhite.The aluminum is also nice and sturdy, but as others have mentioned a case is needed or else this little device will unintentionally slip out of your hands. Maybe a texturized aluminum would have been better?",4 people found this helpful

I have really wanted to like this kindle, and do appreciate the screen options and waterproofing for backpacking/reading in the tub etc., but the ergonomics of this kindle were a MAJOR downgrade and are nearly impossible to look past.  Amazon went from a wonderfully functional soft-touch rubbery coating on the paperwhite to a hard, slick plastic on which it is extremely difficult to maintain a grip.  Additionally, they decided to go with a stepped design that is super thin for 4/5th of the width and then has a crazy bulged out rectangle.  After months of using this thing I still can not find a comfortable way to hold this device and typically have to rest it's bottom on my lap/chest/furniture to be able to read for more than a few minutes.  If they had soft-touched it or molded in some finger notches on the bulge I suspect that this problem would have been minimized but as it stands I would not recommend buying this device, go with a paperwhite it's cheaper and you can hold it...",2 people found this helpful

Device is easy and intuitive to use. Controls and feedback are responsive. My big pet peeve is the metal body. It's nearly winter, so device is cold to the touch. I'm also thinking of how hot this thing will get if I ever leave it sitting out in the sun during the summer. I had a Kindle for about 5 years before the charging port broke and I got myself this one. The Oasis is better in every aspect except for material in my opinion. I just wish there were more options for body material, I definitely would've gone with plastic over metal. First thing I did after unboxing was order a case, so hopefully I'll have no complaints once that arrives.",4 people found this helpful

I prop my Kindle and the bottom power button was a deal breaker, but beyond that the screen illumination, touchscreen page turn, and other factors pointed me directly to the Oasis.  Yes, it's expensive.  But I am so glad I made the move!

Something else I like which is unique to the Oasis is the extra inch you get in screen size. It makes it easier to read with.

Hesitated bc of expense but relented when price was deeply reduced at Black Friday.  I have to say it is a real and definitive upgrade over the Paperwhite.  Battery life has been much better than expected and it is just a much more solid device with a quality feel and display (and it should be for the exorbitant price, even with discount).  IMHO, there is no excuse for 8GB memory and a micro-USB connector in a late-2019, premium e-reader.  Is it worth the price difference over a Paperwhite?  It's hard to say; probably not if you're on a budget and/or you don't use your Kindle several hours a day, especially for night-time reading.

I can read much longer than usual, especially at night, with the warm light background.I don't pay much attention, never have, to battery life, so I can't comment on it.  All I know is that it will get me through an entire day of reading, or get me through a long plane ride, and still have plenty of power left.  Like my cell phone, I plug it in every night at bedtime.In summary, a HUGE improvement over the original Oasis, and a must have for serious readers.",

My preference is to read a book while simultaneously listening to it. Typically, I will listen to the Audible app on my iPhone while reading on my Voyage. When I learned that the Oasis could pair with Bluetooth headphones and play Audible books, I was excited.But the catch is that the Kindle Oasis will not do both. You CAN NOT see the text of a book while the audio plays.If you want to read a book on a Kindle Oasis while also listening to it, you will need a Kindle Oasis device and another device with the Audible app on it.This defeats the purpose of upgrading and, in my opinion, draws into question the nature of these ""features.""If you want the Kindle Oasis for the larger screen and design, then this is worth considering. But if the ideal feature for you is Bluetooth pairing, you will do better with a mobile device like an iPhone. The audible app and the Kindle mobile apps are vastly superior for simultaneous reading and listening.If you don't already have a Kindle, one of the cheaper ones is good enough. The features are not worth the expense.The Oasis would have been my third. While it's faster and the text is marginally crisper, it's still reasonably close to my Voyage.Needless to say, I've returned it and will stick to the Voyage.Also of note: The iOS Kindle app is so superior to a Kindle device that it's worth mentioning. I don't use my Kindle Voyage because it is better than iOS. I use it because it has fewer distractions‚Äîsomething to consider.If you have time to kill, open up a chat window with Amazon support and ask them if the Kindle Oasis will play an audible while also displaying the book's text.

The Paperwhite 2018 had very little retention when that setting was off.-The shape makes holding it really awkward to hold.-The metal casing is more slippery than the plastic casing of the Paperwhite.

My eyes aren't what they used to be.  Other Kindles let you adjust the text size of whatever you're reading but I found that with the Oasis I didn't need to do much adjusting.  The larger screen made a big difference for me.I also love having physical buttons to push when I want to turn the page.  My first E Reader was a generation 1 Kindle so that has a nostalgic feel for me.  Don't worry, if you like the touch screen you can turn pages that way too.The automatic lighting system is great!

The new one is definitely heavier and ""slicker"" so makes for a bit harder one handed reading.  It also does not have the recharging cover which was always great as a backup when you ran out of batteries while reading.  The new one is by far a better screen and lighting and the size of the screen makes for a better read (it is more the size of a book page so you are turning pages less often).  It is also considerably more responsive.  So I guess the only downside, so far as I haven't gauged battery life yet, is the extra weight.",

First, although the device is wider, the space allocated on the side opposite the buttons is too narrow to allow holding it without changing the page. You need to disable the kindle‚Äôs touch screen to avoid this. However, to enable it again (for example to look up a word) you have to turn it off and on again. Secondly, the width takes it just out of reach of being able to put it in most pockets, something that I enjoyed doing with my paper white. Thirdly, the ‚Äúbump‚Äù makes it easy to hold but if you want to read while laying it on a flat surface, you need to put something under the non-bump side to make it lie flat.  Lastly, the battery is ok, not great. I don‚Äôt only read for half an hour a day, so that spec doesn‚Äôt apply for how long my battery lasts. I dimmed the display and put it in airplane mode which helps, but again, it needs to be charged more often than my paper white.",

Secondly, I found it overly sensitive to any stray touch. If I even got close to the top of the screen, the settings would pop up. It's a shame because I loved the screen size and I also really liked the adjustable light. When I was reading with my husband and the light on (for his paperback) there was very little light. But when we turned the lights out, it adjusted perfectly. I just can't justify the price of this with the glitches I kept having. I have an old (maybe 5 years?)

I declined their offer but bought a new one anyway. The problem is immediately apparent: some genius in product development decided to make the original model bigger, with the result that I can no longer easily hit the keys with one hand when held with the navigation buttons on the left. The seemingly simple cure: just hold it with the keys on the right, defeats the purpose of being able to hold it in either hand, which I found quite useful with the original. Just as annoying, it will no longer fit in my pants' hip pocket, my preferred place for carrying.

The other was the first version of the Oasis that had the removable cover. It was very light, and, by comparison, this is heavier. It also has a bigger screen which accounts for some of the weight. As an e-reader, it has what I want. It has physical buttons and all the rest. I miss my first version Oasis but it was starting to hold the charge less and less and it needed replacement.

But if you are spending, probably most customers, more than twice what you paid for your paperback, you might very well consider keeping your paperback and save yourself some money. The goods: Touchscreen works slightly better than the paperback. Inch wider. Warm color. The bad: You can't go for more than 48 hours without recharging the device if you read 1-2 hours a day. Analyze the next scenario: 100% Battery at 10 PM. By 7 AM you'll have only 80+% without having it open. Midday after a couple of hours of studying would be 60 something. Reading after dinner would take you to 40s. The next morning is 29%. You barely make it for another round of continuous studying. Reading before bedtime can't be done without completing a recharge. That's less than 48hours. It does lose charge a lot while in sleep mode and have tried turning off the screen manually, it does not work. At least that's my experience. In the past, I have had a few paperbacks. I could have the same routine without looking for my charger for more than a week. Probably two. If you're paying double, shouldn't you want the performance to double as well? So, I'm strongly considering returning this one and going back to the good old paperback model.

If this were just a little bigger then maybe I could see using it, but in comparison to what I was used to, it just wasn't going to work.

I had to manually go in and tell it to sync to the furthest location.  I also tried hooking my bluetooth headphones up to it to listen to audio books and the headphones kept partially dropping out.  They never drop out on any of the other devices I use, so I know it had to be the Kindle.  The buttons on the side were nice, especially when I learned how to switch the order of them (I like the page forward on the bottom), but it was distracting watching the pages flash when they changed.

I received it as a birthday gift.  Unfortunately it was too late to return it to get a full refund.  I am done with Kindles altogether after my experience.This is. HUGE waste of $250.  Even at a sales price of $189 it's not worth the money.  The battery drains way too quickly even on airplane mode with the light turned down.  I get more battery life from my 5 year old iPad Air than I do this piece of crap.The bigger size makes it impossible to hold with just one hand especially with a cover on it.I will be selling this and investing in a device in anything other than a Kindle at this point. I'm absolutely disappointed with the Oasis and with Amazon.In just 10 minutes my battery went from 77% to 64%.  This is not acceptable at this price point.  Amazon did an excellent job at marketing an absolute piece of crap.I would advise spending your money on something worthy of the price.  This shouldn't cost more than $80 at most.Update:Amazon customer service contacted me regarding this review and offered to send a replacement. However, they neglected to inform me the replacement would be a used/refurbished oasis.The 'replacement''s battery life is just as bad, if not worse, than the original.This is a common issue with the Oasis. I wish I had read the reviews as well as their return policy before spending $250 for a device whose battery life has decreased 10% in the 2 minutes is has taken me to update this review.Amazon replaces new kindle devices with used/refurbished ones.

The new screen is much better for my eyes. It is larger, the resolution is better and the backlight helps. I am using a bit denser font than I used on the Thumb and more text fits on the screen. The touch screen and controls seem a bit better - more smooth. The functions and controls are comparable. I like the paging buttons, though it would not be the top priority for me. The battery life is shorter that the Kindle thumb's life, but is still more that 2 weeks for me.  In summary, I like to read this Kindle Oasis.",

But at least with the page turn buttons I can stop being interrupted in my reading with definitions of words.Sadly, I still seem to be unable to stop the accidental highlighting when I accodently hit the screen.I Appreciate the light weight.I dislike the way the machine whites out and shuts down intermittently. At first, I thought this was battery, but no. Perhaps it is the awkwardly placed off/on switch?I need to be able to read with left hand only. This appears to be a problem‚Äî when the angle goes flat, it reverts to right hand far too soon. This needs to be something to disable.The screen is slower than early kindles, both to wake up and for in-book page turns.Verdict: bad vision and lack of manual dexterity (unusable right hand and twitchy left) mean I need big print, fast page turns, and a book that stays a book (not a dictionary). This machine is useable.

They are not. One still has to poke around at the edges to access features.  And for some reason hard buttons have  been added to the side of the reader which are more difficult to use than a page swipe.  This makes the reader wider and less convenient to stash in large pockets or purses.  What really makes me angry is that I used the trade-in program and sent Amazon a perfectly good reader for which I paid about far less than my Echo eventually cost.  Amazon said my old reader was non-functional and I did not get $25 dollars credit toward the new reader.  Furthermore, when I bought my first books for the new reader Amazon did not include the option for me to download to the new reader.  The entire experience has been awful and expensive.

In my opinion, that and the warm/cool color temp and many LEDs are what you're really paying for.

They have been more than satisfactory, as is this one, but it does have a couple of quirks. If you read more than two hours a day, even if you are careful and only use the internet as briefly as possible and do not exceed the mid lightness position, a week to ten days is the max on a charge; certainly adequate but not ""weeks."" Due to the variation in thickness, if the device is placed on a flat surface to read, best change pages by tapping the screen, not pressing the buttons. Using the buttons will rock the device and provide an uncertain result. If holding it in the hands to read do not hold it by or have a finger on the black area to the left of the reading area. Otherwise a small inadvertent squeeze on the black area on the right will send you to what seems to be a random location earlier in the copy or article you are reading. And while not a drawback, I have been unable to figure out the purpose of ""warming"" the screen. My lack of imagination, no doubt. I need to add: after several months of use I am replacing it with a Paperwhite. It continually freezes and has to be restarted.",

I see people with large screen phones that are able to zoom in and out of the same type of books (manga) with considerable ease, making me wonder why I paid so much for this device.  Otherwise, the battery life is good, I have not had the misfortune to 'test' the waterproof-ness of this device.  It does collect some fingerprints on the up and down button areas and that is also annoying.  There are some annoying aspects about this device, but overall it is a good device for reading while traveling (if you are not reading manga/graphic novels).

Kindle Oasis ‚Äì With 7‚Äù display and page turn buttons,1.0,Too fragile,"Reviewed in the United States on July 2, 2021",Digital Storage Capacity: 32 GB | Offer Type: Lockscreen Ad-Supported | Color: Graphite | Option: Without Kindle Unlimited,True,"I've had my old kindle for ten years. I upgraded to the Oasis because I wanted the buttons, like the ones on my old Kindle. This device is awesome. You can use the light it has, but if you turn it all the way down, then it's just like a piece of paper, same way as my old Kindle. It has the page turn buttons on one side only but when you flip the Kindle, the text flips as well, so fast you don't even notice, and the buttons reverse so that always the button on top goes to the next page instead of the ""next page"" button being below instead of up when you turn the kindle. All this said, I really liked the Kindle, but I've had it for a few days only and it fell. It was inside a case, and it didn't hit anything, yet the screen shattered. It's glass, it became powdery and almost cut my fingers. Thankfully Amazon agreed to replace it. If you're reading this, this is a great Kindle but do get the extended warranty. I'm sad to know that it will probably not last as much as my old Kindle. It's not worth the price, it should be cheaper. But the reading experience is great so I'll keep it.Edit: I thought I‚Äôd had to update you all and let you know that the replacement I received the battery didn‚Äôt even last a day.

It's light weight, non-glare, and very easy to carry around. If I could have a wish list for a future version it would include color screen (so the book covers can be seen easier) and a slightly larger screen. However I would like a future version to not weigh much more. I love how light this device is compared to using my iPad (which is heavier). I would like to see Amazon reduce or eliminate the flickering that occurs when scrolling through my library or changing menus. The flicker cheapens the device and makes it a little less appealing. No flickering occurs while reading, just in user interface areas when screens are changed.",

The screen is bigger than my previous kindle and the page turning buttons I've wished for for a long time.Update: Battery only good for about 300 pages before needing recharge. Very disappointed with product.However I was very disappointed with the usability of the device. The page flipping buttons are backwards! The top button pages forward and the bottom one pages back. Since the bottom button is the most thumb accessible when holding the device with one hand, it would have made better sense to make the bottom button page forward. The second problem is that though page turning buttons are available on this device, the old tap on the side of the screen way to turn pages still works. With the narrow bezel on the left, you are likely to accidentally flip pages just holding the device. It will even accidentally trigger when reaching for the buttons, resulting in skipping pages! It's been very frustrating always having to check if still on the right page.I'd highly recommend future software updates allow exchanging button functions and disabling page turning via taps.Overall and contrary to previous KIndles, this one at more than twice the price has been a disappointment.

Kindle Oasis ‚Äì With 7‚Äù display and page turn buttons,2.0,Definitely Not Worth It.,"Reviewed in the United States on February 24, 2021",Digital Storage Capacity: 8 GB | Offer Type: Lockscreen Ad-Supported | Color: Graphite | Option: Without Kindle Unlimited,True,"I'm a long-time Kindle user and have had a few different models. A little over a year ago I decided to splurge on the top-of-the-line Oasis and gave my Paperwhite to my daughter. I wish I still had the Paperwhite. After just over a year the Oasis battery now only lasts a few days at best. The page flip buttons were never very useful, as the forward button would occasionally go back a page instead, and tapping on the screen to turn the page is most often easier. I also find the physical proportions more cumbersome than the Paperwhite and too wide to go in any pocket. The only advantage to the Oasis in my opinion is it's improved back lighting. But this slight advantage is in no way worth paying the price of two Paperwhites. For the incredible premium of the Oasis, I think they should at least have a longer warranty. The abysmal battery life is making this device unusable, and as it is now out of warranty, there is nothing I can do about it. I would not recommend this device to anyone.",One person found this helpful

Did Amazon know enough about me to predict they could force me to this decision eventually? Or is the Billionaire Cowboy genre just the hottest thing right now?Since Amazon obviously knows what kind of books I read, and those I don‚Äôt why not at least customize what they plaster all over my device for all the world to see?As for the device itself, I like the page turn buttons. I also like the ability to play audiobooks, although I always have another device to do that.But as someone who likes to annotate, the laggy typing (no improvement from my older Paperwhite) makes it a frustrating experience. Of course since I suppose everyone is reading Football Hotties, annotations are a rarely used feature.I feel very ill-used by this tactic.

I can see in concept that it is a good idea, but there are several challenges.  First, the size of the the raised back is completely dependent on the size of your hand.  In my case, it was not a good fit.  Next is the ledge off the raised back when you try to hold one handed that is too curved to actually have good grip from the fingers.  Lastly about the raised back is that the aluminum surface looks very nice and shiny, but it is slippery and hard to hold in that regard as well.  I ordered my Oasis as a bundle that also came with an Amazon protective cover.  The cover mitigated some of my listed concerns, but it was still surprisingly a slick material that made it harder than expected to hold.I also was a bit surprised when comparing this to a much older Kindle as to how jittery and slow the page transitions seemed on the Oasis.

It's a good size for reading, and the screen is excellent. I really like the orange backlight for reading in a dark room.Make a kindle that is a little thicker than the oasis, same size screen, all plastic (less slippery than the Oasis), with physical buttons on the sides (both sides!) or back, orange backlight, and you'll have the perfect ebook reader.

It is not horrible if you own very few books and haven't collected any samples to preview prior to purchase.

Your view is cluttered with advertisements, and books that you've already finished reading. It is no longer possible to unload books from your kindle home screen without permanently deleting them from your library.

Also, I expected Amazon to offer charging covers, as with the prior model. No dice there. Makes it a necessity to have a charging cable closeby.If I could go back to the older model, I would.

Loved the ""warm"" screen feature and the more ergonomic design. However, after a little use I decided to return the product. The battery life is terrible, even with airplane mode engaged. I found I was having to charge it as often as my dying Paperwhite which I've had for years and has been constantly in use. I also noticed the pages ghosting through more and more often. It was super distracting trying to read with the ghost of another page underneath. For the huge price premium from the Paperwhite, this product is not worth it for all the issues with battery life and screen ghosting. I will wait for the Paperwhites to go back on sale and purchase a new one. I would recommend skipping the Oasis until Amazon improves upon these issues.",One person found this helpful

The Oasis gives you the bigger screen but at double the price, the slight increase in screen size isn't good value.  The biggest downside of the Oasis is that it is impossible to hold comfortably at all.  I find that I cannot hold it to read for any significant time.  So you're forced to buy a case and at that point, all that money you paid to get a sleek lightweight reader is moot.  Sure there are some features that are improvements to the PW but if you can't hold an ereader to read comfortably, all those features are pointless.  I read with the PW sans case and it's so easy to hold with one or two hands. I wish Amazon would offer a 8inch version of the PW.",2 people found this helpful

Color me gobsmacked.I have a paperwhite that doesn‚Äôt have this issue.As many reviews have mentioned, battery life is not as advertised.Oh, also, at the risk of sounding ridiculous, I am really not a fan of the aluminum (or whatever metal it is made out of). It gets too cold - I find it unpleasant to hold cold metal in bed at night in winter. I‚Äôm just not about that life. I actually have a bigger qualm with this than with the battery life.It‚Äôs also awkward to hold. I‚Äôm a non-large person with average-sized women‚Äôs hands, so not sure if that factors in.Oasis versus Paperwhite- The larger screen, warm light, page turning bottoms, and autorotate when you flip it 180 degrees are the features that I would say are superior to the paperwhite.",2 people found this helpful

As you can see through the photos, I received two different devices with a defect on the top right side (the side with the page turners). It's a raised portion of the screen it would seem, and is an issue I have seen on two of my kindles (with the third kindle, I got tired of exchanging and I decided to just keep it since it's less pronounced than the one before it). The other issue is the dead/super bright pixels that have always plagued Kindle devices, which was the issue with the second device that I returned. Once I noticed it, I couldn't stop staring at it.It is clear that your chances are VERY high that you will be paying over $250 for an imperfect device, and for that much money I expect more from Amazon.",41 people found this helpful

The screen size and how it adjusts to light and flips depending on which hand you want to hold in. The way the page turner buttons stay how they were setup no mater which hand it's held in. I haven't had the chance to read by the pool but soon enough. What I totally hate about this version is the battery life. I'm pretty much charging daily.

All the weight is loaded to one side which means your wrist quickly gets sore and tired if you hold the Oasis in one hand in any position other than resting on your lap or a counter.The metal is cold and impersonal, so you need a cover which is just a lot of extra plastic to cramp fingers or get in the way.My last kindle was a paperwhite purchased in 2013, and it was soft to the touch and perfectly balanced in the hand. The Oasis, by contrast, feels as though it was designed by someone who has never held a book or any smartphone.If you love curling up with a book for long marathons of rainy day or beach reading, pass on the oasis. Until they make a version which truly improves on the sensual aspects of the design, who cares about the other crap?It‚Äôs a reading device. That‚Äôs its primary function.

While the display and form factor are good there are deficiencies which overwhelm that good.In truth, I may have simply and unluckily received a lemon. We have owned every Kindle version since day one, except for the basement version, so I have a level of expectation based on that experience. This particular Kindle fails that expectation.It is plagued with application errors which interrupt the experience by requiring frequent restarts.Its wi-fi works intermittently. That is to say connections fail or time out...while other Kindles and phones, sitting next to it, complete the exact same task, on the same network, at the same time.  It's tiresome to attempt to peruse the store when all one gets is a blank screen. (It was suggested to use my phone, or other computer, and have purchases delivered to the Oasis. üòÇ)As others have pointed out, battery life is far from good (unless one remembers to turn wi-fi off/on and set scr√©en brightness to minimum) and the inexplicable decision to not incorporate a USB-C port is baffling.The much hyped ""amber"" feature simply seems to darken the screen and offers no real benefit...at least to my eyes.In sum, simply a disappointing device. Oh to have my traded-in Voyage back!UPDATE April 9, 2020 - After struggling with this device for months, I gave up using it as it's not worth the frustration it causes. It now serves as an expensive paperweight.",45 people found this helpful

My old Paperwhite would last at least a week, but the Oasis only lasted 1.5 days MAX. I can barely get through a book without needing a charge which is excruciatingly annoying.Adding to the disappointments, the Oasis doesn't support USB-C, meaning I have to carry around a separate cord for it everywhere and use a different charger. A shame that Amazon hasn't caught up with the times.For a lot of you it may not be a deal-breaker, but as an avid reader who travels a lot, this definitely is one to me. I hope Amazon comes up with a new refresh soon and fixes these problems because I can't wait to get rid of my current Oasis.",2 people found this helpful

In the past, pushing the on/off button would allow you to get it back on. As of about a week ago, pushing the on-off switch does nothing.

Kindle Oasis ‚Äì With 7‚Äù display and page turn buttons,1.0,Worst button placement for one handed holding and horrible battery life..,"Reviewed in the United States üá∫üá∏ on September 7, 2019",Digital Storage Capacity: 8 GB | Offer Type: Lockscreen Ad-Supported | Color: Graphite | Option: Without Kindle Unlimited,True,"I debated spending over $250 on an ereader but finally pulled the trigger on the oasis. The screen looks just like my paperwhite. The warmer color option is a nice touch but that and an overall higher end case is the main difference.The primary reason for my purchase of the oasis was that it has physical page turn buttons. My right side is paralyzed so I needed something that is easy to hold and manipulate with just the left hand. Unfortunately, the buttons are placed right where your thumb rests on the device. Because of this I am constantly changing pages any time I adjust my grip. The ability to turn the touchscreen off may help but really, the buttons were put in the worst possible spot for me.Put the new screen on my old kindle keyboard and you'd have a winner. This design is not good, and the price is extreme for the basic level of functionality.Update: I have since returned this, the battery became the straw that broke the camels back. I've used it 4-5 times a week for no more than an hour each time and have charged it from between 10-20% to 100% on 3 occasions! I'm averaging about 6 hours per charge!Needed tweaks in order for me to be interested in purchasing another kindle oasis:-better placement of buttons.-way better battery performance.-USB C",76 people found this helpful

First, the quality is not as good as what was on the early Kindles.  Second, to set it up, you must activate it through an Accessibility setting, which dramatically changes how you navigate through the Oasis.  You must highlight any command, then click twice on it.  In the meantime, this dreadful digital voice recites to you what you are doing.  Finally, the support on this was most disappointing.  The first human I spoke to really did not know how to access the t-t-s mode.  We were finally timed out, but he never called back.  So, I had to start all over again.  The second person did know what she was doing and when we timed out, she had the courtesy to call back.  Unfortunately, I waited too long to do all of this, and my refund period has expired.

The phone call to arrange this took over an hour!I find the Oasis uncomfortable to hold in one hand because it is unbalanced. Also, the sensitivity of the touch buttons should be adjustable because they are hard to work if you have arthritic thumbs.

As soon as I turned it on I immediately noticed that the left side of the screen is significantly brighter than the right side. Also when at warmth setting 0, the right side has an ugly green-tone while the left side has a blue-white tone. This is very annoying and Amazon customer support wouldn't help me because photographing this minute yet very overbearing detail with a phone was nearly impossible. I'm hearing everyone saying that their screens look so uniform, so I'm just going to assume I got a bad unit. Overall, the warm-white to green gradient and uneven splotchiness all over the screen is making me return it since I couldn't even get through one line of text without this very annoying glaring defect distracting me. The only time the screen is uniform is when I turn up the warmth all the way, in which case the device is unbearable to look at under all lighting conditions.

It is a very awkward device to hold. The back is metal, very cold and very slippery compared to the nice soft touch of the Voyage or Paperwhite. Difficult to hold for long with one hand, and unpleasant to hold with two hands because it's so thin yet lopsided.

Voyage was the best Kindle, hope they decide to keep that line going someday! The Oasis is too odd and uncomfortable.",

I like to see the location in the books I am reading and this Kindle resets itself after every few pages to show nothing. It is while continuously reading and not turning the device on and off. This is causing a lesser enjoyment of my books andI would hope that a future update will address this design/software flaw.I also miss the collections formatting/functionality of early Kindles, where books placed in collections no longer appeared in the library other than the collection. This makes locating books very difficult, having to scroll through hundreds of pages to find your title.",2 people found this helpful

I'm 44 and I'm starting to get age-onset farsightedness and the glare of my laptop and cellphone cause a lot of stress on my eyes.So, I'm begrudgingly keeping this overpriced reader because my eyes aren't tired, stressed, and hurting after reading on the Oasis. (If the UI and touch interface weren't such a mess, I'd highly recommend this device.)",51 people found this helpful

Kindle Oasis ‚Äì With 7‚Äù display and page turn buttons,4.0,"The Pros, Cons and Oks for Kindle Oasis (HR).","Reviewed in the United States on July 29, 2019",Digital Storage Capacity: 32 GB | Offer Type: Lockscreen Ad-Supported | Color: Graphite | Option: Without Kindle Unlimited,False,"Pros:__________‚Ä¢  It‚Äôs small, provides basically two simple physical controls, and a sleek premium aluminum design that makes it beautiful to look at without showing off.‚Ä¢  The screens warm temperature display works like a charm. You can either adjust it manually in the setting section or just set it to automatically active with sunrise and sunset. I just put in an automatic timer and overall found it a pleasure to use this feature at night. The warm effect doesn‚Äôt bring in any eye irritation to me, at night or day, which a computer screen does.‚Ä¢  Surprisingly for me, I found the need to apply the warm temperature display on all day. The reason why is because the effect creates the illusion of flipping through old pages in a book. I‚Äôm always a physical book person, so this feature brings in the comfort of that feeling.  It makes it look like real paper! Still, I only use the cool display when it‚Äôs super bright out, but other than that the warm display is perfect regardless of day or night.‚Ä¢  You have many intensity levels of cool brightness to ranges of the warm temperature effect that can match your need. From mild yellow to full-on amber color, Amazon finally put in the right software for this display because I‚Äôm getting a clear display and no glare regardless of any ambient lighting.‚Ä¢  The E-ink display is very fast and efficient. I mean you‚Äôre just reading so the processing power isn‚Äôt that much as I didn‚Äôt notice any ghosting while reading.‚Ä¢  This is one of the only times that I‚Äôm glad for a bezel border because I can always place my hand at the perfect spot on the device, right underneath the page buttons.‚Ä¢  The page buttons themselves provide great feedback when I press them.  They‚Äôre not loud but it does give you that little click, which I love. You can use the touch screen to turn pages, but I felt the buttons provide a better experience.‚Ä¢  Regardless if you're left or right-handed, the device is ambidextrous! I flip the screen to my left the display adapts to it, just as if I flipped it to the right. The experience is the same for all.‚Ä¢  I took it out in a clear sunny day and the anti-glare matte display screen provided perfect viewing angles even when the sun was hitting at it the most.‚Ä¢  The touch screen is responsive as I like that it has a soft-touch texture on it. It creates a pleasurable experience and kills the creations of my fingerprint.‚Ä¢  IPX8 waterproof means it can be washed off and taken almost anywhere. I didn‚Äôt submerge it in a pool of water but an IPX8 will stand almost all forms of water issues (just don‚Äôt use it under the water.)‚Ä¢  Bluetooth is super-fast. Connecting my Airpods took less than 20 seconds, and the feedback is spot on.‚Ä¢  Battery life is in no way going to be an issue. From my one battery test, I got around 21 hours of use! The average person will probably read 30-40 minutes a day with this.  Having Wi-Fi on will eat a lot more but, in the end, the math doesn‚Äôt lie.‚Ä¢  The software of highlighting text, placing bookmarks, getting extra info about your book, and adding notes is very straight forward and doesn‚Äôt require digging around the system to use them. For me, one feature I use a lot is tapping a word and get the dictionary pulled up for the word (you need Wi-Fi).‚Ä¢  You can input MOBI, PDF, and TXT files on this device (I‚Äôll go into more details later on).‚Ä¢  One cool feature I like is that if you use your kindle email address, you can upload files to your Oasis. I found this 10x quicker as I used this format when transferring my Steve Jobs autobiography book from my IPad to the Oasis (via email).‚Ä¢  At the time pf my review, I found 10 different fonts, 14 sizes, and numerous alignment choices. I can save numerous themes and have the option to switch back and forth if I wanted to. I found this feature helpful if more than one person uses this device.‚Ä¢  The books themselves are pretty cheap to buy on Amazon. It‚Äôs even better if you‚Äôre a Prime member because you can ‚Äúborrow‚Äù books from the Prime Reading catalog. There is also Amazon First Reads that I like but overall, if you get this device, Amazon is the way to go in getting your books/magazines.‚Ä¢  Unlike a smartphone, I know that if you treat your Oasis right, you‚Äôll get a pretty good shelve life with it.Cons and Oks:__________‚Ä¢  Micro-USB! Are they serious? Just like Amazon‚Äôs previous models, no USB-C connector. Micro-USB brings slow for charging and importing files.  With Micro-USB, I‚Äôm getting around 3 hours, 0-100%, for a complete charge. I don't know who decided to have this design feature, but come on!‚Ä¢  No headphone jack! No idea why this isn‚Äôt built-in because they even have the room for it on the device.‚Ä¢  Getting used in finding your brightness and temperature setting will take some time. Amazon gives a lot of options on the display, as I spent a decent amount of time just figuring out which type of lighting I wanted.‚Ä¢  The keyboard is a touchscreen keyboard.  So expect a slow typing rate. Sadly I can‚Äôt apply the tracing effect that many androids and google phones provide on their keyboards.‚Ä¢ The aluminum design does make this slippery to hold, and it‚Äôs able to slide off my lap pretty easily.‚Ä¢ Also, with aluminum, it takes in the heat or the cold a lot quicker if you leave it outdoors or in a hot car.‚Ä¢ Without a decent cover, it feels like I‚Äôm holding a piece of metal than the feeling of holding a book.‚Ä¢  Can‚Äôt connect to 5GhZ Wi-Fi network.‚Ä¢  Even if this Oasis looks the same as its previous models, I found out that you can‚Äôt really use the same covers.  My colleague has the older model and issue we found is that the magnet covers of the last case model don‚Äôt stick with the new Oasis.  Almost the same size and weight, you expect that older covers to work, but nope. I‚Äôll have to pay for a new case cover.‚Ä¢  At the time of my review, I get ads on the lock screen of the device. You can remove them, but you have to pay around $20 to make it ad-free. I found this ridiculous given what you‚Äôre already paying for it.‚Ä¢  As I mentioned before, you can upload MOBI, PDF, and TXT files on this device.  This is cool, but when I put in a simple pdf file (composed of a small story) the formatting gets lost in the process. The paragraphs were mashed together, there was a delay when you wanted to turn to the next page, and overall it looks like a big mess.  Now, this could be just a one-time event, but I have to assume any third party software that goes into the Oasis will face some issues (Importing audiobooks did work flawlessly though).‚Ä¢  No microSD. That means the storage you have is what you‚Äôre going to have forever. This is buzz kill because I know for only 8 GB (Minus 1 GB for the initial software) you‚Äôre going to only have maybe 20 audiobooks go have on storage.  It seems more appropriate, given the shelf life of this device, to just invest in the 32 GB since there is no way to upgrade the 8 GB.‚Ä¢  It‚Äôs small, but not small enough to fit your pocket. Be careful where you put it because I feel like I can bend this without any issue if I wanted to.‚Ä¢  The browser feature, I believe, is very experimental. Because of the display, many webpages are shown up broken or just unreadable. Obliviously this isn‚Äôt for web browsing, but it‚Äôs a feature they provide that I just ignore.‚Ä¢  It‚Äôs almost the same in software and design as its previous model. With the price, I was expecting Amazon to a least redesign it into something different (maybe less in the bezels).  It‚Äôs still a beautiful design but, given the identical looks as its previous model, as the only main difference is the warm color effect. I know this is what Amazon is advertising but they had 2 years to redesign it. I guess the saying goes ‚Äúif it ain't broke, don't fix it.‚ÄùBottom Line:__________As not having a Kindle before this, I would say that I‚Äôm having a pleasant time reading with this.  I always prefer a ‚Äúreal‚Äù book to read, but having thousands of books at my fingertips, it does reduce that need. To be honest, it‚Äôs kind of scary to see the possibility that kids can use this more than a physical book. It reminds me of a scene from the 1960‚Äôs film ‚ÄúThe Time Machine,‚Äù where George goes into to future to find out that all the books he touches turn into a fine powder because no one has used them in centuries.But ignoring that thought, there really isn‚Äôt any competition for devices like these, and Amazon does know how to build them. It's sleek, fast, and most importantly, the screen is superb in reading. The warm light effect does make me feel that I‚Äôm still reading an old book, while the battery life is holding its ground.Note, if anyone has the previous model of the Oasis, don‚Äôt bother buying this.  It‚Äôs the same thing, except without the warm display and some small software upgrades. For new people, I recommend that you invest in the 32 GB because 8 GB is not nearly enough (given that you can‚Äôt even install a MicroSD to it). There are some smaller issues with the design of the device that make me feel like I‚Äôm holding a machine instead of a book (not to mention the Micro-USB!), but for those who want to take a leap in digital reading, this is the way to go.Overall: An above-average device for book readers of all ages, and a small step forward in the extinction of physical books.Hope I was a help to you.Love,Honest Reviewer.","7,976 people found this helpful"

Kindle Oasis ‚Äì With 7‚Äù display and page turn buttons,4.0,Nice ... but this minor refresh could have been much better,"Reviewed in the United States on December 25, 2019",Digital Storage Capacity: 8 GB | Offer Type: Lockscreen Ad-Supported | Color: Graphite | Option: Without Kindle Unlimited,False,"Pretty nice e-reader, definitely better than the highly popular Paperwhite. But worth more than double the price?First the negatives:Amazon didn't put much effort into this upgrade ... it is virtually unchanged from the previous (2017) version. Added a warm light control which is nice, but other manufacturers like Kobo have had that for many years. And the Kobo warm light, on their excellent Aura One, is much stronger than the Oasis which does almost nothing for the first 1/2 of the range and then only turns the screen from a bluish grey to a tan. Never gets orange or close to amber, regardless of the settings. And it still uses a micro-usb connector which is pathetic on their most expensive, flagship, reader. Battery life is fair, it seems better if you put the device in airplane mode and turn off back-lighting .. which defeats the purpose of the comfort lighting. I've started turning off the lighting during the day and only using it at night to make the battery have decent life. Lastly, given Amazon's wealth and the cost of this device, there should be no ads ... aka special offers. They should be an opt in-out for amazon advertisements on something this expensive so that only people who want to see the ads will see them. Selling a $150 item for $250 and then wanting another $20 to turn off ads is nothing short of greedy. My Kobo Aura One on the other hand does not have any advertisements.Now, On the plus side, Very well built, and I love the page buttons. They make page turns very easy when you don't want to use a stylus or your finger. The display is beautiful making the Oasis a joy to read on. Clear sharp text on.a nice screen with great even lighting ..  much much better the Paperwhite whose lighting was much less even due to the fewer number of LED lights. The Oasis is comfortable to hold, both with and without a case.Overall, it is a really nice e-reader, one of the nicer ones around. I do enjoy reading on it and would recommend it if you have a trade-in that will get you 25% off, or if you can grab one when they put them on sale (e.g. the 2019 Black Friday sale). My negative comments were simply because I expected more from the upgrade of the previous model. I would give this 5 stars if Amazon had put a little more effort into this upgrade e.g usb-c, got rid of the ads, put in a longer lasting battery, and brought the price down. Still I do find it to be an excellent e-reader and recommend it though the competition, Kobo Aura One, Likebook  Mars and the Pocketbook InkPad 3 are worth looking into unless you are already heavily invested in the Kindle book ecosystem.",

I have been struggling with the Oasis for over 6 months and so wish I had returned it the first 30 days! The light dims or brightens on its own every few minutes, even with auto brightness turned off. It is very hard to get to the home or library screens, and so often I give up and don't read anything. Most of the time I can't get off the ""Before You Go"" screen to even open a book. I can't get to the home or library links, which are suppose to be available, as the links do not display. Sometimes those links pop up (by sheer luck) and when I try to start a new book, it simply will not open, so I have to read whatever book will open. Tonight it started a new trick, flipping on its own to the last page of several books I have managed to read, then while trying to get out of those pages I can only access the ""Before You Go"" screen again. The help book on the Kindle is of no help, only telling me how to operate the 3 main buttons but not how to get to the library link, which they insist is available at the bottom (or top left) of the screen. I really, truly hate this Kindle and it has put me off buying another one. I may have to change to Nook.

Kindle Oasis ‚Äì With 7‚Äù display and page turn buttons,3.0,Battery Life Claims Are False,"Reviewed in the United States on June 15, 2022",Digital Storage Capacity: 8 GB | Offer Type: Lockscreen Ad-Supported | Color: Graphite | Option: Without Kindle Unlimited,False,"Look, I absolutely love my Kindle Oasis. But I have a bone to pick about the battery life for this model, because I traded in my older model which has the battery case in order to upgrade to this one.I read for about 1-2 hours every day, without fail. I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs excessive, and I rarely have the time to read more than that on a daily basis. But I end up having to charge this device every few days just to make sure it doesn‚Äôt die while I‚Äôm reading. And while theoretically it‚Äôs not a big deal to just plug it in each night, I got so accustomed to not charging but once every 3-4 weeks that I still haven‚Äôt conditioned myself to do that. Additionally, if I were to go for a week-long camping trip, for example, this device wouldn‚Äôt last without being charged during the trip.I think that‚Äôs a massive disappointment considering how awesome the battery life on the older model was. Now tons of people will tell me it‚Äôs because of things like indexing issues, etc., but rest assured I have factory reset, repeatedly indexed my books, eliminated all books from my downloads that I‚Äôm not actively reading, turned airplane mode on, etc. The reality is just that the claims here about the battery life of the device are either blatantly false or the device itself has an issue that Amazon hasn‚Äôt bothered to fix either in retooling or software updates.I love my Oasis and remain a dedicated user of it. But for the love of god, please make the battery life on the 2022/2023 model better.

The reading experience is wonderful.Things I don't love: battery life (not the best, certainly noticeably less than my old Paperwhite), and the sharp edges, BUT I fixed this last problem...Yes, the metal back wraps up around to the level of the screen, and yes the edge is sharp. Not ""cut you"" sharp, but very much ""digs into your skin and uncomfortable to hold for anything more than short sessions"" sharp, at least in my experience. So, I ran those metal edges over my knife sharpening stones, first on the 800 grit to grind down the edge, then the 3000 grit to refine the surface. Worked like a charm and only took 5 minutes.Got mine on Woot at an AMAZING price (sold as a 9th gen. ad-supported international version, though mine actually arrived with English as the default and is NOT an ad-supported model, so I won that lottery!). I would never have paid the full price for the Oasis. At it's core, it's still just a Kindle, and a nice build with a few extra features doesn't add up to an experience worth nearly triple the price of a regular Kindle. Let's face it, basically book pages look the same on any Kindle device. But the Woot sale ($163) was a bargain, and even the Amazon refurb price is still a tad pricy but fair.",

USB-C - Duh?! As has been ubiquitously pointed out, it is indeed extremely baffling that micro-USB passed muster in 2019 for a top of the line Kindle when USB-C is everywhere and is the de facto standard. Why?! I am fairly certain that it is not because of technological complexity or price. Please fix this embarrassment in the next generation Oasis please. Did I say ""PLEASE""?2. No Ads - Seriously! Again we are talking about the top of the line Kindle! I shouldn't have to pay $20 extra for an ad-free experience. Best way to repackage this is to offer this as a opt-in option and you can market this to promote personalized notifications to enhance the user experience. That gives the user a choice and takes money out of the equation.3. Charger - Again for a premium product, you expect the user to shell additional dollars to buy a charger? This should be bundled in!4. Higher Storage - I get the same storage in Oasis that I would with a device that is priced at 50% a la Paperwhite. There has to be greater number of differentiators between the two models and higher storage on Oasis is one way to do it, It would be useful for people who use a lot of audio books. How about a 128 GB or 256 GB option?5. Better format compatibility - Think about the possibilities! When everyone else is supporting EPUB, why can't kindle?  What better way to attract non-Kindle users? Downsides are not much because of the ecosystem lock-in that Amazon already enjoys by a great degree against its competitors. At the very least, native Kindle software should support seamless conversion options for unsupported formats.6. Battery life and issues: Another differentiator with Paperwhite could be longer battery life with Oasis. Also there seem to be several reported issues with the battery and it would be nice to do a root cause analysis of that and fix them.7. External storage: Wouldn't it be nice to have a SD card option?There are several others but they are lower priority for me such as bigger screen (7"" seems like an ideal size to be able to hold it one hand), color screen (for comic book lovers), audio jack (for people wanting to use a wired headset), additional bundled options (magnetic case, case with keyboard, multi-plug global adapter, etc.)I am sticking with my Kindle from a decade ago which still works like a charm. I would love to upgrade in a heartbeat even if all you do is just #1 above.So why three stars? After all I have not bought or used the product. I trust the positive reviews of the product enough to declare that this is a high quality product but I do know that the above missing features doesn't qualify this to be a 5 star (or even a 4 star) product for the price.",6 people found this helpful

I'd been reading most of the trip, but then put the Oasis in the backseat area of the car as we got closer (by some other stuff I was bringing along). Our driveway was snowed in, so we had to stop at the top of the hill and shovel our way in. I trudged down through the snow to get in the cabin and turn up the heat. When we got the car down to the cabin and unloaded my Kindle had simply vanished!!! My husband and I retraced our driving/unloading route...several times. I called the gas station we'd stopped at along the way thinking it might have fallen out there---although we never even opened the back doors, but...who knows? I called the local grocery store where we'd stopped...it was dark and frigid but the manager ran outside to look in the parking lot. It was just GONE. We basically tore the car apart about five times thinking it had to be somewhere!!! Nope.Yesterday, when we got to the lake, I opened the screen door...and there lay my Kindle!!!!!!!!!!!! Someone, I don't know who (but it almost HAD to be the neighbors right behind us) must have found it!!! And, put it in the doorway. Can you believe after almost two months it was still charged?!!

Kindle Oasis ‚Äì With 7‚Äù display and page turn buttons,3.0,"Substantially improved, but a flagship product should be better","Reviewed in the United States on August 2, 2019",Digital Storage Capacity: 32 GB | Offer Type: Lockscreen Ad-Supported | Color: Champagne Gold | Option: Without Kindle Unlimited,False,"Compared to other Kindles (I've owned most of them, I traded in FOUR on this one): the hand grip and auto-flip that this model provides are far superior for extended reading, especially if, like me, you prefer to read with a one-hand grip and roll over and switch hands regularly.  The extra screen size makes a really big difference in the overall experience.  The lighting is more even and better controlled.  A few downsides here: It does not fit in your pocket.  There is no origami case to stand it up on a restaurant table.  Battery life remains relatively poor.  And the software in the new model is pretty twitchy right now... a couple of times it has just failed to connect to Amazon to d/l a new book [no, it was NOT a problem with my WiFi or Internet]; browsing in my library it decided to flash the page every few seconds [no, there were no new books and no changes going on].  Probably in 6 months or so the fact that it is buggy will get through their usual layers of defensive denial and it should get fixed.Compared to the old Oasis, improvements: battery life is significantly better (clearly they found and fixed some hardware design flaw that was wasting power, that's probably the actual reason they made this ""new model""), the touch screen has not been freezing (so far), the switch to flip the page has not been locking (so far); the warm color is nice.But.  With WiFi on, the battery still drains like pouring water out of a glass.  The page-turn buttons still have that stupid click trick, where they occasionally feel and sound just like they worked, but leave me on the same page.  Aaargh!And.  They moved the magnet/cover sensor so... even though it fits perfectly in the case for the prior Oasis version... it does not work correctly i.e. does not turn on when you open the cover and does not TURN OFF when you close it.  That was a nasty design trick and they REALLY need to advertise that it is NOT COMPATIBLE with a case from the form-factor-identical prior version.Final note, I re-tested a whole pile of earlier models deciding what to trade in... and what to keep for a spare.  And  as an alternate that is easier to pocket and read on a table that I don't own (and thus is not equipped with a stand), I kept my Kindle Voyage.  I used it exclusively for 3 weeks waiting for the new Oasis, and I was fine with it.  I did switch mainly to the new Oasis when it arrived. But I recommend the Voyage (you should be able to get a refurb, and hopefully also still find its origami case) for a spare/alternate.",5 people found this helpful

You can place your Kindle in a small space though you can carry not two but thousands of books with you to read wherever or whenever you are and follow those stories you love. The battery is ok and as with any electric equipment you have to charge once in a while that for me is not a nuisance.

Kindle Oasis ‚Äì With 7‚Äù display and page turn buttons,1.0,"Disappointing and WAY overpriced.  Can't import ""Collections"" to the PC App","Reviewed in the United States on October 3, 2019",Digital Storage Capacity: 8 GB | Offer Type: Lockscreen Ad-Supported | Color: Graphite | Option: Without Kindle Unlimited,False,"I am BEYOND disappointed.First, what I like.  The design is great.  The light weight and the screen are beautiful.What I hate:I have been buying Kindle books for years, and I use them on my iPad and my PC.  The downside to this is my iPad is way too heavy for reading sometimes.  It get‚Äôs cumbersome.  Another downside is that years ago, on an old PC, I created a bunch of collections for my books to keep them organized.  Since then I have built a new PC and was disappointed to discover that although my collections sync across all my devices, they DON‚ÄôT sync with the Kindle for PC app on my new PC.  SO‚Ä¶ I noticed that there is an Import Collections feature on the PC app.  I did some research and even spoke with Amazon customer service and was told that the import feature ONLY works when you connect a Kindle device to your PC.  That was my main reason for finally buying a Kindle‚Ä¶ that and realizing that it weighs about a third of what my iPad weighs.  So, I shelled out the big bucks for an Oasis for 32 gigs of space, it‚Äôs waterproof, and because the screen is slightly larger than the other models.  Got everything set up on my Oasis, signed in, even bought some new books.Guess what.  I go to sync my Kindle with my PC app, and it doesn‚Äôt work.  So I contacted customer service and chatted online for an hour.  First, ‚ÄúIs your device plugged into the computer?  Unplug it.  Restart the device.  Is it connected to WiFi?  Is your WiFi working?  Is your computer connected to WiFi?  Can you access the internet on the computer?  Have you tried restarting the device?  Sync the device again.  Now try importing‚Ä¶‚ÄùThen, I was told that I needed to download ALL of my books onto the Kindle and THEN it would import the collections on the PC app.After speaking with three different people in customer service, who are frankly clueless about their own device, I opted to allow them to call me.  Then I spent another 40 minutes with them on the phone while trying to figure out why the ‚ÄúDeliver to My Device‚Äù feature on the Amazon Manage My Kindle Page wasn‚Äôt sending all of my books to my device.  ‚ÄúClick sync on the device.  Is it connected to WiFi still?  Have you restarted the device? You need to deregister the device and then re-register it‚Ä¶‚Äù  And then she finally says that I simply need to click on each of my 200 plus books one by one on the device itself and they will download.  So then she was waiting for me to do this‚Ä¶  It takes awhile because there are only six books on a screen at once.  Then she puts me on hold.  When she returns, she can‚Äôt hear me.  Then she puts me on hold, and she calls me from another number, and still can‚Äôt hear me.  So then she hangs up on me on both lines.  Note that my wife called ten minutes later and could hear me just fine.So customer service is all but worthless.I finally got all of the books downloaded, and guess what.  IT STILL DOESN‚ÄôT IMPORT MY COLLECTIONS.  I even tried making some new collections directly on the device, but they still don‚Äôt import.Tonight, while doing all of this, I started seeing adds, when I wasn‚Äôt before.  I realized that I had to pay an ADDITIONAL $20 to ‚ÄúUnsubscribe‚Äù from the stupid adds.  And then, when I paid to remove the adds, they didn't go away!!!  So now I‚Äôm supposed to call and deal with customer service again‚Ä¶This has become a bigger headache than it‚Äôs worth.  The on screen menus are not very intuitive.  And the dang thing is glitchy‚Ä¶Seriously Amazon, WHY WOULDN'T YOU MAKE YOUR PC APP DO WHAT ALL THE OTHER OS APPS DO, AND SYNC COLLECTIONS?  All of the book notes and highlights sync?  Why not the collections?  If I create a collection on the PC, it syncs THAT with all the other devices.  Why is there even an IMPORT function if it's not going to work?  Have you not noticed that people are complaining about this all over the internet?We want to be able to access our collections because the easiest way to manage collections is on the PC app.",5 people found this helpful

Also for any of you who read foreign books, you also know that you can't load more than one country's store on your Kindle without wiping out the other books, so I have a third paper white to read all the books I buy in the German Kindle store.

Want a waterproof e-reader with a small screen and physical buttons. You're tech savvy enough to remove DRM and Don't use PDFs. Already have a nice tablet/phone for all the missing basic features. You don't need TTS(text to speech). You don't use the library, only limited support for OverDrive in the USA). You don't travel and use Kindle accounts from other countries.Battery life is terrible unless you're always in airplane mode and only read with the light off. You can read the fine print..""weeks of battery life"" ...oh, ""30 minutes per day""...so uh, worse than the latest mini  tablets with much better features, Unless you read in the the direct sunlight all day.Display only has good contrast in full sun or under a bright light. Must be noted though it's fantastic under these conditions. So for beach readers it's great.  Auto brightness is super finicky and buggy. At one point I had to reset my Kindle because auto brightness would turn off lighting all together. But when I disabled auto brightness I couldn't manually turn off the light even when set to off.  If you read a lot late at night or in a room with bad lighting... Don't buy this.Can't download many books in LTE, says they are ""too large."" Oddly enough I never  get this message ever for Amazon unlimited books....so guess they're uh, not being honest.Apparently they've completely disabled mp3 support. Could swear in older Kindles you could manually load MP3s and at least play them. So Bluetooth is worthless. Many audio features that work on a tablet don't work on a Kindle.Doesn't support the majority of ebook formats.The version that has ads disabled still has a non removable add stuck  on the main menu.. and oh, btw... You can't even use what they advertise all the time on LTE... Bah. You can disable the ads in the bottom of the home screen and their spy tracking, but the ad free version should default to that.Web browser is still experimental after 10+ years? And it has terrible ghosting. You literally have to rotate the display back and forth to ""full refresh"" the page. There is no option to do that besides for reading books.Basic features like a timer or eye rest reminders do not exist at all.UI design is straight out of the 90's. Three layers deep just to change font size. Actions have different behavior on different screens, but the UI gives no indication that behavior will be different.Limited accessibility options. Nonhigh contrast mose. It does have text to speech, but it only works in screen reader mode and is a pain to use.Only supports one ebook library system, and of course no apps can be installed to access others. Also had trouble with borrowed foreign language books showing up as English in the Kindle. Audiobooks from any library system doesn't work. While it does support PDF, the results are terrible.And the most annoying of all. Kindle store is walled off by region. So you can't use Kindle unlimited from the US while reading e-books bought from other regions.

The only Kindle I have ever returned was the original Oasis (6 inch) because, it just didn't like the way it felt in the hand, coundn't find a comfortable way to hold it. When the 9th gen Oasis (7 inch) came out, I pre-ordered and fell in love on delivery. I also fell in love with the leather, magnetic cover. Amazon fixed the things I didn't like about the Oasis, and added new features. So, when the Oasis 10th gen was announced I pre-ordered.  Well, color me disappointed. Here are my complaints, and these things may not matter to you, this is all subjective. One, It won't work with the original, leather, magnetic cover. I need a case/cover the works as a stand and have never been happy with 3rd party Kindle covers.  Two, the sleep/wake function only works with Amazon cases, not 3rd party, and Amazon does not make a standing case/cover for this device. That's it, but it was enough for me to go back to my 9th gen Oasis. I didn't read on the device enough to evaluate the lighting, I like the idea of more LEDs, and the lighting was, as always, uniform. The warm lighting just didn't seem to matter, maybe reading in a dark room, but I'm not keeping it, so I can't evaluate that. As far as the micro USB vs. USB-c, well, I get why Amazon hasn't gone there yet, this is not a smart phone or tablet, so it doesn't really need USB-c.  I'm sure eventually that will be all there is, and the Kindles will change when that happens.",3 people found this helpful

Kindle Oasis ‚Äì With 7‚Äù display and page turn buttons,3.0,Battery was the deal breaker.,"Reviewed in the United States üá∫üá∏ on August 1, 2019",Digital Storage Capacity: 8 GB | Offer Type: Lockscreen Ad-Supported | Color: Graphite | Option: Without Kindle Unlimited,False,"I was buying this as a potential replacement for my Kobo Aura One Limited Edition. I was disappointed by the Kobos screen, it's slow to respond and I also very often have to tap multiple times before it does anything. The Oasis screen is extremely responsive and page turns are a breeze with the buttons. The brightness is impressively uniform and is very pleasant on the eyes. The Oasis also sits very well in the hands. But these are its only winning points over the Kobo. The Oasis has much fewer customization options, and the smaller screen means frequent page turns for people who like to read with large-ish text. Also, the Oasis menu and interface is much more obnoxious, being geared towards encouraging you to spend more money. These three points are unfortunate but tolerable, the deal breaker is the battery life. I thought the Kobo was bad, lasting me about 10 days heavy reading with airplane mode, the Oasis was nearly dead after a few days of heavy use. I don't want to have to cart around an outdated micro USB cable if I'll be leaving the house for more than a few days, which is frequent for me. The Kobo also uses micro USB, but they (kind of) get a pass because the device is over a year old. But the newest, most expensive Kindle absolutely should not use micro USB.

The Oasis does that but, as compared to my Kindle Paperwhite, the ability to turn pages and to go to section view on newspapers is not as reliable.  For example, maybe half the times I open the LA times, it opens like a book where I can only turn page by page.  I can't go to the next article or see articles by section.  This can be corrected by closing and reopening the paper.  When it does open as a periodical, still sometimes touching the next article at the bottom does not work.  I have also had times when the buttons do not work to turn the page but the touch screen does work.  (This happens with both newspaper and books).

This is my first Kindle ever, and it's a convenient way to read books. Oftentimes, I read multiple books at the same time, so this is a great way for me to carry all my books with me without the hefty weight. The light adjustments seem nice to have that many options, but I don't think the auto-brightness works. Maybe I have a broken Kindle, but it doesn't seem to auto-adjust for me. I think that it is made ergonomically sound, although I often find myself holding it upside-down with my left hand and the heavier side on the left.Things I don't like:-For a $350 piece of hardware that doesn't even have color screen, you would think that it doesn't have to spend seconds waking up.-As I mentioned before, the auto-brightness doesn't seem to work.-Wikipedia and Dictionary function takes a while to get to.-No USB-C for something that costs double of the next version down is not good.-I'm not sure if anyone else has this issue, but I can only charge mine to 99% without ever hitting 100%.",2 people found this helpful

Kindle Oasis ‚Äì With 7‚Äù display and page turn buttons,1.0,I despise this device,"Reviewed in the United States üá∫üá∏ on March 13, 2021",,False,"I had the original Kindle with the keyboard.  The best word to describe it is ""SIMPLICITY"".  The technicians get so carried away with themselves to justify their jobs that they make this the most unenjoyable experience ever and I loved my old Kindle.  I had to get a new one because it became hard difficult to charge - I had it many years though.For example, in the Oasis, I set it to show percentage of book read.  It would stay for a while.  Then I found in the HUGE MANUAL that to have it show each time you open the book, you have to go to another setting for your device.  Ridiculous!  I don't have all day to push buttons.Next, if I finish a book I have only two choices - mark it READ in which is stays in my list of books with the word read under it.  Another Ridiculous option.  I have a lot of books in my library and when I'm finished, the only other option I see is to delete it in which case it says if you ever want to read it again, you must repurchase it.  REALLY?!!!If I've purchased a book, I'm not getting rid of it.  My husband and I have been searching and searching for an option to archive it so that it's still available but not in my library.  Oh I can start a ""collection"" which I entitled ""read"" so that it only takes up one line in my library.  My original kindle was so easy - you finished the book and then pushed archive and it stayed there away from your list of books to read.I don't like the touch screen - it's awkward, I'm a button person.  It does have buttons for page turning, but when I'm looking up a book in the Store it drives me crazy.The batteries go dead very quickly.  My original Kindle had the book light you pulled out of it, so the batteries lasted much longer.There is nothing I like about this.  I think technicians are wacko.  I wonder if I can get a rebuilt original keyboard model?  Or else maybe look into Barnes and Nobles e-readers.If anyone knows how I can store a ""read"" book and remove it from my list, please let me know.  We have tried various instructions we've seen on line but I always end up with the same limited menu.",

Kindles were the only devices with this dreadful micro-usb port. Our phones, laptops, tablets, earphones, power banks and all the cables are all usb-c. We had not realized how convenient it was to have all usb-c until we got these kindles. We hated the micro-usb port so much that we returned both our kindles.We are not buying any more kindles until they switch to usb-c! Amazon should fire the engineers or the people who were responsible for choosing micro-usb over usb-c. Amazon owning Audible shoud make kindles with usb-c and make it audio port also. With so many usb-c earphones being ubiquitous, we could both charge and listen to Audible audio books with a single usb-c port. Having less cables is also good for the environment!

Let me be blunt; any device that still uses microUSB is stone-age. And then, to chase me out of the store, the aluminum is as slick as a greased pig.

For starters, it took a long time (overnight) for the battery to charge fully (green light glowing) and only lasted one week before time to recharge at 13%. To read inside the house, I had to put the brightness indicator full on (probably contributed to shorter battery life) and the warm light was no big deal for me, in contrast to many reviewers gushing about how wonderful it was.  While I liked the dark background toggle for late-night reading in bed, there was no adjustment possible.  The gold case was a nice variation to have, and am going to try the 9th Gen Oasis (without warm light) next.  My favorite Kindle is the original Oasis model, with the recharging cover.

I‚Äôm getting a frozen page of text when I unlock it to read just as often as the white screen.  Both require holding the power button.It‚Äôs super frustrating when I just want to sit and read for a few, but have to spend the first few minutes getting up and running.Once I‚Äôm up and running, the device is great! Turning pages is super fast, and all the other features are helpful.",

I just have to hope I don't drop it in the water.I really wish amazon would make a white device, especially for the ones that would tend to be used outside in the sun/pool.Very disappointed with that part.Aside from that, the device works fine.

Battery life is AWFUL...much worse than my kindle paper whites.  Needs charging every day.  2. Push buttons are awkwardly arranged.  When I hold the device in a comfortable reading position, my thumb is closest to the lower button, which should take me to the next page, but instead goes back one page.  Not sure why they designed it this way, rather than having the upper button take you back one page & the lower button to the next page. 3. Finally, this complaint applies to both my kindle oasis and paperwhite...Although I can adjust the font size while reading a book, there seems to be no way to enlarge the font while shopping for a new book. This makes it almost impossible to easily decide on a new book, especially if it is late at night when the combination of the tiny print and dim light make it difficult to see the storefront & search or read descriptions (unless I use my iPhone amazon app, which is too bright).",

Kindle Oasis ‚Äì With 7‚Äù display and page turn buttons,5.0,Worth every penny!,"Reviewed in the United States üá∫üá∏ on December 14, 2021",Digital Storage Capacity: 32 GB | Offer Type: Lockscreen Ad-Supported | Color: Graphite | Option: Without Kindle Unlimited,True,"I was hesitant because of the price, I owned an original kindle with keyboard, no touchscreen because they didn't exist then, but it finally stopped working and I needed a replacement.  I am an avid reader, and I do read everyday.  I choose the Oasis after much research because it was rated the top choice for ergonomic and reducing eyestrain.  I had been getting daily headaches reading through the Kindle app on my phone or tablet, and after researching about eyestrain from ""screens"" I found a study that was done between ereaders and regular pc, tablet, or phone screens.  After learning that the eyes and brain recognizes ereader screens the same as a paper book page whereas other screens with bright lighting, etc, do not, I decided I had to replace my original kindle.  I was not disappointed, I choose the oasis, even with a higher price tag, because it was listed as producing the most and best results for the eye/brain correlation to reading an actual book.  I trusted the science, and was greatly rewarded.  I have had my oasis about a month now, a full month of no headaches by the end of the day!  It is so lightweight, feels natural in my hand, and I am in love!  I am also impressed with the thought that went into the design, there are 2 buttons that you can use to turn pages, the top button turns to the next page, the bottom button will turn to previous page.  I prefer the buttons for reading, but love the touchscreen for updating my stored library!  But here is what impressed me, I am right handed, so I open the cover and hold the kindle in my right hand and my thumb rests perfectly near the buttons, but one day I turned it upside down, with the buttons on the left side.  The page oriented immediately, but so did the buttons.  I assumed I would have to push the bottom button to turn the page, but nope, it oriented itself and the top button turned the page, bottom turned back a page.  I was impressed with the forethought that went into the design for left or right handers.  It's a small detail, and not even mentioned in the description, but wow!  Believe all the articles you can research on the various ereaders, if you are an avid reader, the Oasis is the ereader you want.  It has its own email so you can also send pdf files to your library, which really helps with work projects as well and prevents eyestrain.  I highly recommend this for anyone who needs to read alot or is an avid reader like me!  I also highly recommend this for college students who need to read textbooks, the features to highlight and make notes would make this a perfect item to send off with a kid leaving home to attend college and prevent eyestrain and make it easy with its compact form to carry anywhere with multiple books stored in memory.

Kindle Oasis ‚Äì With 7‚Äù display and page turn buttons,3.0,Just okay,"Reviewed in the United States üá∫üá∏ on July 13, 2021",Digital Storage Capacity: 8 GB | Offer Type: Lockscreen Ad-Supported | Color: Graphite | Option: Without Kindle Unlimited,True,I've been reading on Kindles for decades the Paperwhite is by far better.  The Oasis is really uncomfortable to hold when reading in bed.  It actually hurts the palm of my hands.  The only really nice thing about it is that you can change the adjustable warm light for night.  I read every night in bed and it's easier on my eyes but not worth buying it.  I ready with the Paperwhite as much as the Oasis because of the comfort holding and if you read a lot that makes a big difference.  So unless you really need a new one I would wait and save your money until maybe they have a better update.  I wish I had or that I could send mine back.,One person found this helpful
Kindle Oasis ‚Äì With 7‚Äù display and page turn buttons,4.0,Bluetooth pairing with headset  issues 1/26/22,"Reviewed in the United States üá∫üá∏ on January 26, 2022",Digital Storage Capacity: 8 GB | Offer Type: Lockscreen Ad-Supported | Color: Graphite | Option: Without Kindle Unlimited,True,"Overall it is good.  I hardly use the touch screen,  having been greatly annoyed by one on a prior Kindle e-reader.  I think I got the Oasis because I could use the buttons on the side.  I read by a lamp, so the light is irrelevant to me.  The main problem was that the Oasis (and presumably other Kindle readers)  DO NOT pair with just  any Bluetooth headset.  This is not explained at all.  I finally bought one that may pair,  hopefully, when I get it shortly.  It has something to do with  a device's Bluetooth Profile--A2DP perhaps being critical  to Oasis use.  Maybe my headsets were too old, or I don't know what I am doing--don't know--  but be aware of this  if you keep your equipment, namely  Bluetooth headsets, around forever.",

So the first thing I did when I used this e-reader is  of course enlarge things. I did this even before updating! I was a little disappointed, instead of having a scale where I could easily adjust the HUD to see it more easily - they had defaulted options ""Norma, Large, Small"". At first ""large' wasn't large enough, I hardly noticed a difference! Now, once the book is open - this is a perfect device. Navigating to the book of my choice is a bit annoying!  I was happy to see this e-reader would let me use comic books, a huge improvement from the OG Kindle!  Really this is the best device I've used for my legal blindness - be it public speaking (which I do frequently) or at home reading. It could  be, and I hope someone from Amazon cares to read this, it SHOULD be better. Even after updates Kindle's newest E-reader could just be better for the legally blind - AKA a MASSIVE audience that would pay well to see the General User Interface  much better.Amazon, if you have questions, reach out to me, let a legally blind person HELP YOU make your device easily readable and useable to ALL peoples, even those that are sight impaired.",

Kindle Oasis ‚Äì With 7‚Äù display and page turn buttons,5.0,Coming from a Paperwhite,"Reviewed in the United States üá∫üá∏ on January 20, 2020",Digital Storage Capacity: 32 GB | Offer Type: Lockscreen Ad-Supported | Color: Champagne Gold | Option: Without Kindle Unlimited,True,"The Kindle Oasis is like a book lovers dream wrapped in a tiny device that is so thin and small compared to my older model Paperwhite.  I was one of those people who, at first, could not imagine using an electronic device as holding a book in hand, and physically turning a page was it's own enjoyment.  But after purchasing the Paperwhite years ago, it has saved me an arm and a leg in actual book costs as well as storage.In saying that, my old 8 gb Paperwhite was starting to get slow in turning pages, and my husband noticed me complaining about it, and as a surprise bought me the champagne colored Oasis with 32gb for Christmas...which he couldn't help but give to me early as he's horrible at surprises. LOL!  I've been using it for a solid month and a half now, near every day use as reading relaxes me before I go to bed after a hectic work day, and playing with our kids later, and I have to say the upgrade was definitely worth it.For starters the Oasis is super, super thin compared to my old Paperwhite. I had a friend purchase a newer Paperwhite, and the Oasis is still so much thinner and lighter.  It is also wider, which really enhances my reading experience as that little bit of extra measurement gives me a wider reading width on the same font and size I liked using on my Paperwhite.  I adore the curve to the device in the back that allows me to grip the Oasis more securely with a better ergonomic design than my flat Paperwhite.  The two buttons on the side are in easy range to push to turn a page, but I do have to stretch my hand just a tad more to use the touchscreen to turn a page.  However, I do love the buttons more than pressing the touchscreen and solely use those as of right now.  I also love that I can flip my Oasis around, and use my left hand and the whole page will rotate to give me that option if one hand gets tired.  The only buttons on the device is just the power button and the page turn buttons.  There is one Micro USB port, which is pretty standard right now, and I have tons of these lying around the house so I was happy that I won't have to worry about purchasing another one for my office or elsewhere for charging the Oasis.Setting up the Oasis was a breeze, and literally found my Wifi, we have fiber at the house, in seconds, and I was ready to roll! I did charge it fully before use even though it arrived with a little bit of life in it.In regards to charging and battery life, I, at first, felt like the battery wasn't giving me it's all, and I was having to charge more frequently, but I realize I keep my wifi on at all times, and I do read a lot for hours at night (working mom...literally mom zombie the next day, but that's my only ""me"" time). So on average I can read anywhere from two to three hours a night, and it still last me a very, very long time without a charge.  I've literally only charged it three times so far, the first was the first night I received it, the second a few weeks ago when the ""battery low"" indicator came on, and just this weekend.  And this weekend I knew I wanted to read later, so I charged it for perhaps an hour, if that, before reading, and it had already charged 60%! My Paperwhite would not have charged that fast, and this was using the charging cable on a USB hub box.  So very easy to get a good charge with it, and I was highly impressed by that!The screen warming function was something I honestly didn't think I would use as I'm not a sepia person at all...however, after finally using it for the past few nights I feel like an idiot as it's now my favorite feature.  The warm tone has literally changed my reading game. I was reading in bed at night with no lights on so my husband can sleep, and was using the normal white light toned down a bit. My eyes were dry due to working and staring at a computer all day, and slightly hurting, so I tried my warm function, and after playing with it for a little bit, my eyes went from a little pain with the glare, to no pain, no squinting, and me really enjoying my reading experience.  I am now team warm tone. I wouldn't necessarily use it for daytime reading, but at night...this is my go to.I am also a lover of Audio books, and was thrilled I could listen to my Audible books through my Oasis.  Is it really necessary? Not really as I normally use my phone to listen with my bluetooth earbuds while I clean, commute, or at work, but it was a nice feature to have. I have used it, and I will say it works seamlessly.  Just remember you do need wireless earbuds with bluetooth capability to use it as there are no ports to plug it in.  That's perfect for me, as I solely use bluetooth earbuds all day at work.So, is the Kindle Oasis worth it to you? If you already have a nice working Paperwhite, don't have eye strain, and enjoy it...then for the price tag I would just keep the Paperwhite.  Now, if you're in the market for a new Kindle, and want the best experience and are an avid reader, then definitely give the Oasis a try.  It is expensive, especially if you get the bigger gb, but I've had the 8gb for years, and never had any issues as I don't store every book I own on it. I always ""delete"" the book after I read it, and if I want to read it again, I just download it again. It cleans up my space, and keeps everything organized when I go to filter to find something in particular.  My husband did give me the 32gb, and it is nice especially for the Audible experience, but I use that mainly on my phone.  So you can definitely skate by with an 8gb for a cheaper price, and still have countless books as long as you don't download every single book you own/audio book.  I will say, he did get me the Oasis with offers, but it doesn't bother me any to see the ads on my Oasis when it wakes up. I didn't have that on my Paperwhite, but it's not a huge deal at all to see book ads.  Now if you deal with eye strain on the daily from looking at a computer all day, but still want an enjoyable reading experience, then I would definitely recommend the Oasis and the warm tone feature.  I didn't think it would be such a big hit with me, but I love it, and even my husband commented on how nice it was not to be woken up to a super bright light, and have a warm glow instead.  The only issue I actually have is with the case, not the Oasis.  It is crazy thin also which is great, but when you push the front cover to the back it takes away the nice grip, and leaves a flat surface to hold onto.  I've since lost the case, and use a sleeve to put my Oasis in, and I have on a screen protector.  In all I love my Oasis, and am happy to have upgraded.",5 people found this helpful

Bought it last black Friday (had the Voyager before for 4 years). It's a great e-reader w/ a few extras like the 7 inch screen, the extra side lights, flipping it and it is always facing correctly. But, for the money, it should have been better. It takes about 10 hours to charge. Mine does not charge to 100% any more no matter how long, it only now goes up to 95%. The reader is very slow to start up. Page turning isn't very 'snappy', but slowish. It can be a little slippery to hold because of the smooth surface. And the battery really only lasts between 11 to 12 hours. So, if you read a lot daily, you have to charge it every other day.Am I glad I bought it, yes, but at the black Friday discount (-$80). I would have been very unhappy paying full price.Side Note: If you buy this eready and are looking for a great case for it. Check out the 'Flintie Flip Case' at $20.

This one is my favorite so far.  Checks all the boxes.Weight - Solid, does not feel like a toy like my previous Oasis.  I know that the heftiness is due to the battery size and i'm okay with that.  Small con - won't fit easily in a jeans pocket like my previous Oasis.Lighting - good with the lighting and the light/dark modes.  Honestly don't see much difference in lighting vs my Paperwhite.  The touted ""soft light"" doesn't really make a difference to me personally.Battery - charges very fast, so far have seen it last 2-3 days of pretty heavy use (traveling on a plane, 5-6hrs of use per day).  Very pleased with the battery life.Water resistance - haven't tested this really, but nice to know it's there.I like the Oasis vs the Paperwhite for two main reasons - the physical page turn buttons, and the switching perspective when i switch hands.  I read a lot in an easy chair, and the ability to change my hands to use the buttons is the main selling point of the Oasis.One note - a case is pretty much necessary, as the plastic is rather slick to hold on to.  I recommend and use the Amazon origami stand-up case.Overall, another 5 star product that I am completely satisfied with.",3 people found this helpful

I thought about getting one for years and finally did it, paid full price, and glad I did.  I've had e-readers for 13 years, the Oasis is my third one, after a Sony and a Paperwhite.  The Oasis is a whole new ballgame for me in terms of controlling the lighting and managing eyestrain.  I wear reading glasses with blue light filtering, but the Paperwhite still gave me eyestrain, and the Oasis does not, with its warmth temperature controls.  I can use smaller fonts now with the Oasis.  It's just great.  The build quality, firmware, responsiveness, all great.  I've had no problems with battery life, since I turn off Wi-Fi when I don't need it.  I didn't trust a lot of the reviews I read on Amazon, so I went to YouTube and watched reviews there.  It was unanimous from reviewers with a lot of experience with e-readers that the Oasis is a spectacular device.  You'll have to choose if its price is justified for your needs, but for me, it was a steal.  This is the device I'd want on a desert island, with a solar charger.",One person found this helpful

Not a big issue, just to note that you have to take a bit of time when navigating.The back of the device is a bit smooth, meaning it's hard to prop up on the sheets to read while lying down.

The screen has been cracked for a long time and the battery is finally giving out. I purchased the newest Oasis on a Black Friday deal, but was very disappointed when it came in. It is bigger and heavier than the first-gen, making one-handed reading less comfortable. It also has a sharp metal edge that digs into my palm when I hold it, definitely not sustainable for long hours of reading. The lack of charging cover also makes it feel less worth the price.At this price point, I wasn't willing to deal with a downgrade.

Kindle Oasis ‚Äì With 7‚Äù display and page turn buttons,5.0,Pleasent Suprise,"Reviewed in the United States üá∫üá∏ on September 9, 2021",Digital Storage Capacity: 32 GB | Offer Type: Lockscreen Ad-Supported | Color: Graphite | Option: Without Kindle Unlimited,True,"I was a little hesitant to buy this originally based on some people complaining about battery life. But I bit the bullet and got the 32GB model/bundle.The battery works as advertised for me. I will say however, it did die overnight from ""full charge"" the first day. I charged it fully and the battery since works fine. I can only assume this is due to a display problem when you originally get the kindle. And that might be because they ship it technically turned on, for whatever reason. That might have just been my device however, and it could be attributed to my linking it to my amazon account before/during purchase. Who knows.If people have their battery dying faster, it might be due to the ""ads"" that the kindle has if you don't opt for paying the higher price. But I didn't notice any difference from having the ads to not having the ads when I payed to opt out of them. I will note I did a little research on that, and the lock screen/ads shouldn't have any realistic impact on battery life in any way you will notice. I mean the lock screen stayed present when the battery ""died"" for me the first day.The kindle has been on for about 5 days straight now and is still at 80% battery, with moderate usage. Using it more, having brightness turned up, or playing audiobooks will likely drain it faster. I assume the ""warm light"" feature drains it faster as well. These are things people should expect to happen with electronic devices lol. Advertising ""weeks long battery life"" is generally for if you don't use the kindle that often, or take advantage of it's features. And that's just kind of a marketing tactic I'd expect most people to be aware of in the modern age. That being said, the battery is long lasting. Far better than say, and iPhone.My only actual complaint I have is the display seems a bit slow, and it sometimes results in me inputting my lock screen password poorly. But it's fully functional otherwise and doesn't delay for more than a second or so. I don't notice any display problems when actually reading a book, but rather with navigating menus. This might be a result of the kindle utilizing some sort of web service/page instead of it using and relying on its own OS/Software/Hardware. Kind of akin to how the Nintendo Switch shop works on their console, for comparison. Take that with a grain of sand however, as it is just my assumptions based on the functionality, comparatively speaking.The display is crisp, clean, and works amazing in a variety of lighting. I haven't taken it outside because I'm a hermit and generally despise people, but based on what I can tell it looks like it would be just fine outside.All in all, I consider this an upgrade from my dinosaur age fire tablet, and don't regret my purchase at all.",2 people found this helpful

There is some modern technology I hate.  One is swiping at a screen.  I like buttons, knobs, etc. I have heard this from other seniors I know.  Maybe it is the arthritis in our hands.I had a Kindle Keyboard.  It was so easy and quick to maneuver from place to place at the touch of a button: Home, Menu, Font, they all were just one touch of a button.With the Oasis touch screen, I am having problems. The controls do not remain at the top of the screen.  It is a fight to get the controls to show.  What is wrong with having buttons on the frame?  The buttons were so much easier to use.  The only features on the Oasis that I liked were the light and the grouping of books by author.  I really wish I could have gotten another Kindle Keyboard.I am sorry I spent the money for this Kindle Oasis.  If I wanted to be irritated with a touch screen, I could have gotten a Paperwhite and saved a lot of money.  I have gone from absolutely loving my Kindle (Keyboard) and thinking it is the best invention ever to absolutely hating my Kindle (Oasis).",
Kindle Oasis ‚Äì With 7‚Äù display and page turn buttons,5.0,"Swiping to turn pages was an epic fail in my 10th gen PW, so glad to have page turn buttons again!!","Reviewed in the United States üá∫üá∏ on November 13, 2020",Digital Storage Capacity: 32 GB | Offer Type: Lockscreen Ad-Supported | Color: Graphite | Option: Without Kindle Unlimited,True,"My first Kindle was a Kindle keyboard purchased in 2011. I still love it, it still works, and I still use it at times. Then I've had two other models: the 2013 Paperwhite, which works well but I wanted more drive space, and a 10th generation Paperwhite purchased in 2018 to get the larger drive. Enjoyed the 2013 device, still have it and use it when traveling, but absolutely hated and despised the 10th generation device. The swipe function just never, never, ever worked properly.  I read fast, and turning almost every page took multiple swipes. My husband had the same experiences with essentially the same devices. So this year we decided to bite the bullet and get each other an Oasis as an early Christmas gift during Prime Day.  I've now been reading on mine for nearly three weeks. Overall, I love the device and I'm thrilled not to have to ""swipe"" anymore. However, as has been the trend with ereaders from Amazon, battery life continues to get worse and worse. I read a LOT now that Covid is a reality - I greatly prefer that to TV and I recently retired, and traveling is not really a good option these days.  I have to charge my Oasis every single night, and no, I'm not reading in the dark with the light turned up high to compensate. I have long term worries about the battery being used in the current devices; over the years the quality of the components in the various ereaders seem to have gone down with every successive generation. As noted, I consider my 10th generation Paperwhite an epic fail in functionality since swiping never functioned properly.  I do enjoy the ability to turn on the warm light on the Oasis at night to block the blue light if reading close to bedtime, but don't need to use that often. It is a well balanced device that is comfortable to hold, and the slightly larger screen is nice.  I hope the considerably higher cost of the Oasis will be mirrored by a long life span - otherwise, it will be time to look at other brands of ereaders. I have to assume that removing buttons from the Paperwhite devices was a marketing decision to drive readers to the considerably more expensive Oasis. I finally gave in, but that will be a one time surrender unless this device has a very long and very healthy lifespan.",3 people found this helpful

Kindle Oasis ‚Äì With 7‚Äù display and page turn buttons,2.0,I wanted to love it‚Ä¶,"Reviewed in the United States üá∫üá∏ on January 19, 2023",Digital Storage Capacity: 32 GB | Offer Type: Lockscreen Ad-Supported | Color: Champagne Gold | Option: Without Kindle Unlimited,True,"I really wanted to love this device, especially because of the page turn buttons! Ultimately though, I decided to go with the new 2021 Paperwhite because other than the buttons, I see no reason to pay the extra $120 for the outdated Oasis. Here‚Äôs a quick break down of pros mixed in with cons in my opinion after a long debate between the two.- Lovely high quality glass screen: this actually ended up being more of a con because I believe the print is a little further back in the Oasis than the Paperwhite, making the Oasis print seem less crisp (when side by side with the Paperwhite with the same settings).- Premium device with aluminum casing and economic grip: Also ended up being a con. While it looks really nice and I do actually like the ergonomic grip, the case is cold in the hand and the edges dug into my hand uncomfortably after a long reading session. With the Paperwhite, the rubber backing prevents the cold feeling and has thicker, more cushiony edges.- Battery life: Certainly not what Amazon promises it to be. I also ended up with a faulty battery that would constantly stop charging at various percentages. After going through some troubleshooting, the issue did not improve. A quick look online tells me that this is an issue that happens a lot with these devices.- Page turn buttons: This is the only thing that sets the Oasis apart in my honest opinion, but as I mentioned already, I cannot justify the extra $120 for this feature when the 2021 Paperwhite offers so much more. **If page turn buttons are important to you, there is a Bluetooth device you can purchase which allows you to turn pages by clicking the device. so you can actually use your kindle hands free. I haven‚Äôt tried it yet but it looks promising.**- The Oasis is quite dated compared to newer models of other kindles (USB-C charging for example). I‚Äôm  surprised it still sells for as much as it does! In my opinion the signature edition of the Paperwhite is of greater value!- I don‚Äôt believe the Oasis is future proof. Without knowing if Amazon plans to release a new one (doesn‚Äôt seem likely at this point since it‚Äôs been 4 years since the last release) it‚Äôs quite possible that the Oasis line will soon be obsolete.- Any other pros of this device are also found on 2021 Paperwhite so I won‚Äôt list them here.Good luck on your decision!

Kindle Oasis ‚Äì With 7‚Äù display and page turn buttons,5.0,"Kindle Oasis (10th Generation), 32GB, Ad-Supported","Reviewed in the United States üá∫üá∏ on September 5, 2021",Digital Storage Capacity: 32 GB | Offer Type: Lockscreen Ad-Supported | Color: Graphite | Option: Without Kindle Unlimited,True,"Prior to getting this reader, I was reading manga either as physical graphic novels and comics or on a screen (tablets or laptops). However, both forms have their drawbacks. Physical graphic novels and comics take up a lot of space and, where I live, real estate runs at a premium. Because of this, I moved on to digital formats, but my laptops are too heavy and unwieldy while my tablet screens end up giving me eye strain after 10 minutes or more. Adding to this, I have well over 25GBs of manga just from Amazon purchases alone, so the Kindle Oasis was the obvious choice in this instance.So I bought this ad-supported, 10th generation, 32GB Kindle Oasis as an exclusive manga reader for titles I've bought through Amazon. I've had this reader for one week and, so far, I'm impressed by its functionality, size, weight, and screen. I took a chance by getting a used one for about 205 bucks (no warranty other than 30-day returns) and a used leather cover for 5. I threw in an extra USB cable charger and a 9W power adapter for 30 bucks, new. Overall, I spent about 250 for the whole set-up and I am pleased.The major CON for this device is its battery life, which is why I bought the extra cable and charger. The battery life is mediocre if you have bright settings too high and have the WiFi and bluetooth running in the background. For that, I'd recommend putting it on Airplane Mode and lowering the brightness levels. It helps a little bit. Still, the battery life is subpar.With that being said, this will be my exclusive portable Amazon manga reader until I run it to the ground. I've already used up all of its 27.5GBs of usable internal memory.  I'm curious to see how long it will last. I still have my Kindle 4 from 2011 and that one is still going strong as my exclusive book reader (my friend also has a Kindle 4 or 5 from 2011 and it still works like new!). So, I have high expectations this device should last me at least a decade. If it doesn't, I'll be back here to update my rating and review.PS - I might byte the bullet and get the latest Paperwhite for audiobooks later this year. I need to spend more time with this device to better tell.",2 people found this helpful

This latest generation of the Kindle Oasis is pretty hard to beat. The display looks like real paper and there is adjustable lighting to even change its tone. It's thin and easy to hold at around 7 inches (basically around the same size as a typical paperback). Even better, it's waterproof, so you can read in the bath or the pool if that's something you enjoy. In terms of content, if you get it with Kindle Unlimited you'll get access to millions of books. It also works with Audible and links up to a BT device if you're more in a listening mode. Touch Screen is a bit hard to navigate at the beginning.",

I love the paper white in light, even in full sunlight. I love the dimming and less blue light as well at night. The fonts are clear and large, even without my cheaters, so this one lives bedside. Seems the battery does last longer than my other paperwhites, but I haven't had to test it, charging is convenient for me (solar charger in my bedroom window).The larger capacity is a wonder too. Now all my collections can live in one device, well, except for the ones with color images that I want to see, but I have an iPad for that, hahaha.Very happy with this purchase, and believe you will be too.I got a nice cover for it, helps keep it protected from oopses.",2 people found this helpful

Kindle Oasis ‚Äì With 7‚Äù display and page turn buttons,5.0,Here are FIVE GOOD reasons for buying an Oasis,"Reviewed in the United States üá∫üá∏ on December 19, 2022",Digital Storage Capacity: 8 GB | Offer Type: Lockscreen Ad-Supported | Color: Graphite | Option: Without Kindle Unlimited,True,"My sisters and I have had Kindles from the beginning and share a library under one Amazon account so that we can all read the books that are purchased or borrowed. Great setup, but because we have different tastes we've owned just about every model. Since we are not homebodies, we each have two Kindles: various choices (from the new basic Kindle to various Paperwhite models) as backup or travel Kindles and an Oasis each for home reading.Why are there Oasis Kindles so essential for each of us? They have features that -- if you read enough to justify the price -- aren't found in the other versions.(1) They have those simply marvelous page turn buttons which all of us vastly prefer to swiping the screen.(2) Altho the new Paperwhite and the Oasis weigh the same, they are not equally comfortable. The Oasis's ergonomic shape makes its weight feel lighter compared to the the new Paperwhite which has the feel of holding a brick.(3) The screen on the Oasis automatically flips 180 degrees as you switch holding it from your right to left hand. No thought required(4) An Oasis takes 30 minutes to fully charge.(5) The Oasis screen is just enough larger than the Paperwhite to feel a difference. The larger the screen, the more a reader gets the advantage of the 300 ppi.There are only two disadvantages: cost (keep an eye out for sales) and the failure of Amazon to switch its power connection from micro-USB to USB-C.Bottom line? The Oasis is the premier Kindle for those read at length and often. It's superb.",9 people found this helpful

This makes it easy to read for long periods without straining my fingers or hand. It also provides instant clicking feedback that encourages me to read more. The buttons are well-placed and have a nice, tactile feel to them.Overall, I am happy with the Kindle Oasis and highly recommend it to anyone looking for a high-quality e-reader with a large display and physical page turn buttons.

Over all other kindles. I see so many raving about the New 2021 Kindle paper-white, that I felt the need to give my opinion, and it is just that, my opinion only. No argument that the new Paper-white with warming light and 6.8 screen  is a great Kindle. I had it as well, but returned it choosing the Oasis to keep.Both kindles are big improvements over previous versions. Granted the Paper-white is cheaper, but to me it feels bulky and big. It does not fit my small hands as well,  nor do I feel it represents an actual book as well as the new Oasis. As far as the clear text and crispness of the page, to be honest I see very little difference. Both are awesome and both are as they claim to be.

Since I bought it on Black Friday, it was an inexpensive upgrade.I like the way the screen flips depending what side you want the buttons on.  This is handy when I read in bed (right side vs left side). I also like the fact that you can still turn pages like a Paperwhite by touching the screen.Amazon should ditch the microUSB in favor of USB-C.One Year Update - - I still am very happy with this purchase.

Since then I've had over 16 kindles. The 1st one in the 2nd 1 had keyboards . After that I had the paperwhite and still had the paperweight until last week. I've had every paperwhite that has come out , every generation. The paperwhite was, to me, the greatest eReader ever made. That was until I got the oasis. The Kindle Oasis is absolutely awesome. Having a bigger screen is just great. For the longest time I could not justify spending the Xtra money on the oasis because, I thought stupidly, that it was just a fancy Paperwhite. I couldn't of been more wrong. Being able to control the backlight,  the way you can with it, is revaluationary. Not only can you control the brightness but also the warmth. If you are in a dark bedroom and you can make the light very warm and therefore easier on your eyes. If you want to go a little further, you can turn on dark mode. Dark mode inverts all the colors. So the text would be white and the background would be shaded out. The Kindle Oasis also has  Automatic orientation so no matter what your dominant hand is, it will be comfortable. The Kindle Oasis also comes with Bluetooth,  Which means now you can download audio books onto your kindle and listen to them when you don't feel like reading.",
