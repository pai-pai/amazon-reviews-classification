"Kindle (2022 release) ‚Äì The lightest and most compact Kindle, now with a 6‚Äù 300 ppi high-resolution display, and 2x the storage - Black",5.0,So much better than print,"Reviewed in the United States on December 7, 2022",Color: Denim | Option: Without Kindle Unlimited | Offer Type: Lockscreen Ad-Supported,True,"If you‚Äôre considering this, and reading this review, you‚Äôre probably considering your first foray into Kindle reading. Good choice. A few things to note about this.The ads are not pop ups. I know some dead tree fans would have you believe, right in the middle of a tense scene, an ad will interrupt the page. That‚Äôs not how this works. What happens is, when you put the device in sleep mode, rather than say the cover or the portrait of a famous author, you see an ad. If you use the physical cover to turn on and off the device, you won‚Äôt see much if any of the ads.  And yes, you can dog ear a page.I have no idea why memes keep popping up to say you can‚Äôt. Actually, the things you can do with a print book that you can‚Äôt with a Kindle book are: Donate them to the library if the library starts taking books again, give used copies to a friend, sell used copies, have a bookmark accidentally fall out, and use them for, well, kindling. Kindle can do everything else. Things you can do on a Kindle and not a print book are: read in the dark, search for text, carry dozens of books in your pocket, create notes of virtually unlimited size (you run out of room in the margin of a print book), pick up a new book nearly anywhere, anytime, and instantly convert your entire library to large print.Most library systems can send any borrowed e-book directly to your Kindle. And your place and notes are stored in case you borrow the book again or buy a copy. You don‚Äôt get that with print.Amazon recently improved their send to Kindle features with a drag and drop web page that makes moving your own documents to the device extremely simple.This comes with a USB-C cable, but not a charger (aka wall wort) so if you don‚Äôt have one lying around (I think the expectation is most of us do) you will need to pick one up.16 gig might not sound like a lot, but most books fall under 2K.  I‚Äôve seen public libraries (I‚Äôm looking at you, Florida) with fewer books than this can hold. Audible eats the memory a bit more, but I find this to be more than enough.You don‚Äôt get cellular connectivity with this, but that‚Äôs only with the premium Oasis line now. Scribe even missed out on that. I find it convenient, but I understand wifi is ubiquitous enough these days it‚Äôs not a big deal for most users. I have an annoying habit of finishing a book on the crosstown bus, then needing the next in the series. Yes, the cell phone tether works. No, that‚Äôs not as convenient as built-in cellular.It has fewer LEDs than most, but that‚Äôs not a big deal. Four lets you read in the dark. The scribe has 35. Guys, it‚Äôs an e-reader, not a disco, no one needs that many separate lights on that small a device. The absence of a warm light and auto adjusting lights are a bigger issue here. The warm light makes a big difference when you‚Äôre reading before bed.It doesn‚Äôt have the waterproofing, which I thought was a bigger deal when that first came out, but in all the time since I‚Äôve yet to (knock wood) get a Kindle wet. It‚Äôs a nice to have, not a have to have.The size can throw people at first. The screen approximates two things ‚Äì an index card turned portrait and a mass market paperback page. The occasional ‚Äúghosting‚Äù mirrors the see-through element of the cheaper mass market paperbacks, except on the device it refreshes quickly, and the ghosting goes away.There were some studies done that suggest memory is improved from reading from print rather than e-book. I want to point out a few issues and cite my own experience. First, all the studies I could find cite pop ups and other distractions as the primary issue. That is, the test is on a general-purpose tablet, not a single purpose e-reader. When they either do a study on an actual e-reader or compare with pop ups on the tablet vs someone coming over just as often and tossing brochures on their print book I‚Äôll believe it. Unless all factors are equal, the study is inherently flawed. To my experience, my ability to absorb and either use the information (if it‚Äôs non-fiction) or retain it over time (if it‚Äôs fiction) is nearly identical in both, with the slight advantage of the e-book being able to search back in the text for prior information. It drives me nuts when a quote resurfaces in a print book, and I can‚Äôt find the prior mention again. Or when I need to find a code snippet in a shelf full of computer books rather than just search on device and have it in seconds.So, if you‚Äôre comfortable with the mass market paperback format, the size, the quality, then this is a huge step up. If you want to lay your hands on information quickly, then this is a huge step up.If you want portability, then this is a huge step up. I just had to help an elderly woman move into assisted living and the loss of space cost her nearly all of her much-loved library. I find it comforting that nearly all of mine fits in my purse. No more culling the library for space, then finding you need to buy a new copy. If you delete an e-book from your Kindle, you can download it again for free. I remember, in the dark days before the Kindle was invented, being stuck on a flight from Arizona to New York with nothing to read but the most misogynistic, worst written mystery novel I‚Äôd ever encountered. If I had a Kindle, I‚Äôd have had at least a dozen better choices at hand, not to mention rereads.The downside here is twofold. First, Dune and The Great Gatsby look the same size on the reader, so it‚Äôs hard to eyeball that one is a super-fast read and the other a meaty novel. It‚Äôs also a little too easy to build up a massive TBR pile, given it takes no physical space, the device memory is ample, and Amazon keeps offering free books to Prime members every month, sometimes more than one, and a crazy number of deeply discounted books Prime or not.If you are concerned about the environment, then this is a matter of economics of scale. On the last study I checked, the magic number was 20. At 20 books the manufacture and transport impact of the e-reader ties the impact of manufacturing and transporting print books. At 21 and beyond, the e-reader has almost no further impact as compared to the printing and transporting of physical books. E-readers have boasted substantial improvements in reducing their carbon footprint since that study, but I can find no more recent information. Even at 20, the worst number, it‚Äôs clear that e-readers are a pure win for the environment.It‚Äôs a great device. If you want to go with this one as the entry level, you won‚Äôt be disappointed.","1,020 people found this helpful"

It felt so easy on my eyes to read, and I liked that it was small and portable. I still couldn't convince myself..I read every day so my mind kept naturally going back to it. I talked myself into by looking at it as a time and learning investment üòÜ I've stopped paying attention to social media a while back and cut down TV time so I can focus on something more productive. I like the idea that this is only for reading. There's not texts on it or social media, or notifications or apps to get distracted. I love that about this.

I love the 6"" Paperwhite for me...my hands are smaller and reading with the 6"" is easier to hold.  Meanwhile, my husband loves his 6.8"" paperwhite.  Both are 11th generation, did not come with the correct plug for the faster charging station, I must retract my comment about them not coming with charging cords.  They did.  I needed to pull out the brown cardboard bit inside the package to see the cord at the bottom. I didn't know that, but feel dumb anyway.  The frustration was increased by an intermittent issue with our Network.  All our devices showed we were consistently online...but the Paperwhite would not connect.  Intermittent issues are always difficult, we seemed to get on,one for everything except Kindle.  Our provider finally saw the failure happen not on our router but in network after many hours over 2 days of trying to explain.  I want to thank Annie and Maggie, at Kindle Tech Support for their patience and their help, for sticking it out with me through trying to figure this out.

"Kindle (2022 release) ‚Äì The lightest and most compact Kindle, now with a 6‚Äù 300 ppi high-resolution display, and 2x the storage - Black",5.0,Read anytime anywhere!,"Reviewed in the United States on February 16, 2023",Color: Black | Option: Without Kindle Unlimited | Offer Type: Lockscreen Ad-Supported,True,"If you just love to read and are not a print purest when it comes to your books, get this thing.I love to read, but I absolutely loathe trying to read a printed book when there is not excellent lighting. I don't know about you, but I cannot stand it when there is a shadow over half of the page or I can't get just the right angle towards the lamp to be able to see the page correctly. I have tried reading lights that clip to my book and hang around my neck but I have never been able to get it right. I felt weird spending a lot of money on a device just to read on but I am so happy that I did.I freaking love this thing. I can read in any lighting and the page is perfectly clear. My wife loves it also because when I stay up late reading in the bed I can turn off all of the lights and not disturb her. The backlight is great. I can read outside and it looks the same as it does inside. Very little glare even in direct sunlight. I also really like that I can have the exact same text size and font no matter what book I am currently reading.The size of this kindle is great because I can slide it in my back pocket if I am somewhere out and about. I can hold it in one hand without feeling like I am holding a giant tablet that I might drop at any moment. Obviously, the touch screen and refresh rate can be a little annoying at times because they seem so out of date, but when all I am doing is reading I do not mind it 99% of the time.Finally, I love that I can turn off/on the page number and I can see how long (in minutes) it may take me to read a chapter. I hate having to close my book in the middle of a chapter because I run out of time. Now that I can see an estimate of how long it will take me to read a chapter I can gage whether I need to start the next chapter or go ahead and set the book down until later.The ads are not bothersome at all so don't worry that they may ruin the kindle in some way. They are not pop ups and are only displayed when you are not reading.If you just love to read and are not a print purest when it comes to your books, get this thing.",78 people found this helpful
"Kindle (2022 release) ‚Äì The lightest and most compact Kindle, now with a 6‚Äù 300 ppi high-resolution display, and 2x the storage - Black",4.0,Great Upgrade but could be a little smaller,"Reviewed in the United States on March 4, 2023",Color: Black | Option: Without Kindle Unlimited | Offer Type: Lockscreen Ad-Supported,True,"I love when Amazon continues to support their kindle e-ink devices. And with every new e-ink release, I always pick them up. They are such a niche product that doesn‚Äôt get enough credit. They are perfect devices that remind you to be more productive in life and help you disconnect and read!The Amazon kindle 2022 version comes with a USB C port and it is long overdue! Now I can finally pack away my micro usb cables for good! The device charges quickly and the battery life is great.The operating system is the same from previous devices but with some new quality of life improvements including a dark mode. I never knew I needed dark mode and I love it.I think the biggest critique I have for this kindle is the screen size. I wish that Amazon would release a smaller e-Ink device that‚Äôs the size of an iPhone. I love the idea of a smaller, more pocket sized kindle that can fit alongside my iPhone.I feel like Amazon is getting really close to an even better device and I hope they consider it. I truly think that a smaller e-ink screen the size of an iPhone would do great.Another suggestion I have for Amazon is to look at the PlayDate device. The playdate is an amazing device. Seriously amazing. I love how animated, and pretty the playdate is and how small it is too.Imagine if the next kindle functioned like a playdate and had more animated menus and sounds and book titles were more pretty. I think there‚Äôs so much possibility there.Anyway thanks for reading my review!",11 people found this helpful

I can make the print bigger or smaller.I can go crazy and order every one of the Longmire series books, then came 2 more different series.

I have the Oasis which I have used for years now, but I bought this one because I wanted to have a kindle I could easily throw in a bag or a coat pocket. It‚Äôs perfect for that, but it‚Äôs actually much more pleasant to hold while reading than the Oasis is. That‚Äôs while using the clear case on it. It‚Äôs a little slippery and hard to grip without the case. I imagine the case with a cover would make it even easier to hold. I definitely recommend this Kindle over the Oasis and possibly the Paperwhite (which I haven‚Äôt tried) because it‚Äôs so comfortable to hold for hours at a time. I would go without the premium features of the other Kindles I mentioned just to have a Kindle that is this lightweight and small. I can only imagine how much I would love it if this little Kindle did come with those features. It would be absolutely perfect. As it is, it‚Äôs a delight.",11 people found this helpful
"Kindle (2022 release) ‚Äì The lightest and most compact Kindle, now with a 6‚Äù 300 ppi high-resolution display, and 2x the storage - Black",5.0,A device with a single purpose: reading,"Reviewed in the United States on December 26, 2022",Color: Black | Option: Without Kindle Unlimited | Offer Type: Lockscreen Ad-Supported,True,"Everyone has a smartphone these days, so at this point the Kindle is for one very particular audience: people who want to read a lot of books, and read them with a minimum of distractions.  With this version, Amazon has refined the Kindle to the point where it's just about ideal for this purpose.  I've owned several previous Kindles, including an early Paperwhite, and currently own a couple of iPads, an iPhone, and a MacBook.  For the purposes of long, immersive reading sessions, this Kindle is my best option.  The battery life is long enough so that even with constant reading you only have to recharge once or twice a week (you can extend that by turning off wireless).  The Kindle also has by far the best screen for immersive reading: it's sharp and clear, with many options for different lighting conditions ranging from bright sunlight (Kindles leave tablets in the dust as far as bright-sun reading is concerned) to pitch black (the dark mode format is ideal for this).  You can choose whether to read with a vertical orientation or a horizontal one -- and this option of a horizontal orientation allows you (among other things) to read poetry on a Kindle without imposing premature line breaks.  This Kindle is also extremely light and easy to hold for hours on end (my iPad mini is too heavy for that).  And as with all Kindles, you can adjust the type size and font so that reading is comfortable for you - I love paper books, I really do, but I need bigger type.In a way, though, what's best about this Kindle is what it doesn't have.  You can't read your email.  You can't go on social media.  Amazon's Kindle browser is perpetually ""experimental"" -- good!  I pick up the Kindle when I want to read books, not when I want to lose my afternoon down an internet rabbit hole.  That said, you do get just enough of the internet to assist in your reading.  From within any book you can look up unfamiliar names/places on Wikipedia, and there's a great built-in dictionary too.  (You can download dictionaries for any language you read, and set them as your default in settings).  But apart from those features, the internet might as well be on Mars.  Fine by me. If I want to look at videos of puppies or lose my temper about politics,  I have my phone (and several other machines, unfortunately).  When I look at my Kindle, I can feel my blood pressure go down.  More to the point, I can hide my phone under a cat and read books for hours and hours.That might not be your idea of an ideal afternoon.  If it is, and you know who you are, this Kindle is pretty inexpensive and much lighter and easier to carry than tablets or physical books.  It allows you to carry thousands of books around with you and then sit and read them without distractions.  It's limited in its other functions - and that's exactly what makes it ideal.As you can probably tell from the above review, I have the patience of a gnat when it comes to content I don't want to see, and for that reason I opted for the ad-free version.  This allows me to have the lock screen be the cover of the current book I'm reading, which is extremely endearing.  That said, the version with ads does not insert ads into your books; they're not obtrusive in that way.  So you can definitely save a few bucks by getting the version with ads - it won't mess with your reading experience.",302 people found this helpful

I'm not a fan of the home page but think I need to spend a littl more time setting it up for me. One recommendation - DO NOT pay to avoid ads! Bless the person who wrote a review and said this as I was ready to pay for no ads. They are NOT intrusive and only appear on the home screen until it wakes up - about 5 seconds.

When I have the time I will do a complete reset to see if that fixes it.I have not used the audible feature as I am one who liked to read vs listen and so I cannot comment on that.

"Kindle (2022 release) ‚Äì The lightest and most compact Kindle, now with a 6‚Äù 300 ppi high-resolution display, and 2x the storage - Black",5.0,Loved Kindle 11th gen over Kindle PW 11th gen,"Reviewed in the United States üá∫üá∏ on October 30, 2022",Color: Black | Option: Without Kindle Unlimited | Offer Type: Lockscreen Ad-Supported,True,"I honestly had a hard time deciding between this Kindle basic 11th gen and the Kindle Paperwhite 11th gen (PW). I own an older PW released in 2015 which I absolutely love but I wanted to finally try the Audible so I decided to upgrade. I tested both this Kindle Basic 11th gen and the Kindle PW 11th gen for about 2 weeks, used both everyday. I'm still a little on the fence but I finally settled with Kindle (basic) 11th gen because it met my basic needs.  Here are my observations which led me to pick the basic model.The first good thing about this basic Kindle is that the screen is more matte than the new PW. I could not get past the reflections that I see on the screen of the new PW when there is a window or light behind me when I'm reading. I do not have that problem with my old PW. I also prefer the lightness and the size of the Kindle basic, although the cheap feel of the plastic build bothered me at first. It slides more easily off my hand than the PW and it scratches easily but I fixed that by putting a back cover on the Kindle basic. The build of the new PW felt a lot sturdier though.I don't mind that the Kindle basic doesn't have the warm light feature that the new PW have although I'd probably use it when reading at night IF the basic had it. The warm light only works if you have the backlight on. I don't mind that the basic is not waterproof unlike the new PW. I don't soak in the tub and I rarely get in the pool to purposely read so I'm fine with it. I also like that the Kindle basic has an actual frame around the screen unlike the flushed screen on the new PW which makes me feel like I'm reading from a tablet, imagine the glare on top of that.Both of them get the slight screen burns when I scroll up or down, not too bad so far. Both of their bluetooth function (BT) worked great for Audible, but the BT coverage on the basic actually went just a few feet farther than the PW before it started cutting out. I did notice that the battery went down faster on the basic but it's probably because I left the BT ""ON"" all the time. I did get the ""application error"" message once on each reader at some point but it didn't seem to affect anything. Neither of them became glitchy although I'm not sure why I got the error message.They both worked good in dark mode. The glitch that other people mentioned when turning the page happened on both new PW and the basic. The dark mode lights up briefly (but quickly) before displaying the next page. This can be fixed by turning off the Page Refresh from the Reading Options menu.There are other features on new PW that I don't mind NOT having only because I could not get past the glare, size, heaviness, and the flushed frame of the PW. The Kindle basic met my basic needs without the cons, ""my cons"", of the PW :)  In my opinion, the Kindle basic is easier to carry because it's super lightweight, fits in my purse or pocket in my jacket easily, and I was able to adjust to the smaller screen size in no time. Overall, I think it would just really be a matter of preference between the two.Edited: I added 2 more pics to show the back cover with popsocket on my Kindle basic! :)",374 people found this helpful

This one was the cheapest so I went with it and absolutely a worthwhile purchase.Firstly, setup was incredibly easy and you get 4 months free of unlimited which has so many books and big titles for free (hunger games, harry potter, lotr, etc)I absolutely love the size, I was worried about it being too small but as someone with longish hands it is SO comfortable to hold and fits perfectly in my hand, put a popsocket on the back and you're golden. Tapping to turn the page is comfortable and overall just a nice experience.I was worried about the screen being too small but it is perfect and you can read on it very easily. This screen has absolutely no glare, we sell PW at my job and that screen has a bit of a sheen to it compared to this one. It looks and feels like paper. I can not believe I can read at night with no eye strain.The battery life is decent, definitely not weeks to a month (depends on how much you read) 2 hours of reading drains 10% of battery. Which is plenty for most and it charges insanely fast. Unless you're planning to be reading somewhere with no access to a charge port for 24+ hours straight with no breaks, you'll be set.Books are SO much cheaper on this. I used to collect physical books, it was a small collection (like 40-50) and sadly it's somewhat expensive and requires a lot of space. A book I was looking into is $18 for a physical and was only $6 on the kindle. So you'll save space and money (also saving time and the papercuts from page flipping)I still love my physical books, but this will make it so much easier for me to be able to read and I've been more inclined to pick up my kindle to read vs scroll on my phone. I highly recommend this kindle.",76 people found this helpful

It is light and small enough to fit in the pocket of most trousers that I wear, shorts even, yet has enough screen real estate and zoom capabilities that gives comfortable reading without having to excessively flip pages.4. It has just one button, quite simple, so no extra pressing and clicking needed.5. I can charge it with my other chargers, so I don't even need to use the cable that came with it, because my phone uses the same thing.6. I had decided against spending extra to remove the lock screen ads, and I am satisfied that I did. The ads are not intrusive, as they only appear when the screen is locked, which means that you are not using the device anyway. I have also glanced at some of the ads and went ""hmmmm.....maybe I should check that out...."". So yes it think it may be of some benefit to have it rather than not.7.

It's the one I reach for, it's the one I want with me.The Oasis is slick, with the buttons and all, but I never could bond with it. That grippy ledge... It's neat, but you lose that if you use a cover, and if you don't use a cover, the device feels cold and hard, because it is made of metal, which feels cold and hard. (And the battery life is *bad*, compared to other Kindles.)The Paperwhite Sig has all the great features... and it really is a great device. I recommend it. Really everything you could want in an eReader. Really.  (Battery life is amazing!)But... but...After a few years with the Oasis and some months with the new Paperwhite Sig, I realized how much I missed the form factor of the early ones. And now the Basic has USB-C and 300 ppi. Those count a lot. I like the warm light on the PW Sig, but I don't miss it when I don't have it. Waterproof sounds good in theory, but even after 10 (?) years of reading everywhere, including the bath tub, it hasn't been a thing. Battery life on the Basic is just fine, and it charges fast.The thing is, the Basic has the perfect form factor. So light to hold, so easy to slip into a pocket. Even at home, where portability isn't an issue, and even sitting in my armchair (as opposed to being in bed), where weight isn't an issue, the Basic is the one I reach for.You would think a bigger screen would always make for a better reading experience... but no. This is highly subjective, but there's just something *cozy* about reading on a little Kindle like the Basic version(s). (If you need a big screen ‚Äî which you do with some books ‚Äî you can use your computer or iPad.)Obviously Amazon should just start making the Paperwhite in multiple sizes, with all the features (give the little one the warm light and waterproofiness), but meanwhile, even without those, I think this is the best one.Save your money, buy the cheapest one, and be happy.

I haven't had to buy another Kindle since my original paperwhite whenever that first came out (several years ago anyway).  That one still worked perfectly fine and I wouldn't even have gotten this one except the software was becoming outdated and I was unable to download some things easily anymore.  I wasn't sure if I wanted to go with more of the bells and whistles of some of the more expensive versions, but I really wanted this size and I'm happy I got this one (I'm not used to the bells and whistles with my kindle anyway).  The only feature I really change daily is the one-touch day to night/night to day lighting button.  Love that!  My only complaint is that the touch screen is very, very sensitive (as was my other paperwhite).  All I have to do is hover my finger over the screen and the page turns, so I get a lot of double page turns and am constantly having to go back a page - annoying to be sure.  I wish there was a way to adjust that sensitivity.  Otherwise it's great.",19 people found this helpful
"Kindle (2022 release) ‚Äì The lightest and most compact Kindle, now with a 6‚Äù 300 ppi high-resolution display, and 2x the storage - Black",5.0,Comparing the Kindle (2022) to the Paperwhite (2021),"Reviewed in the United States on November 10, 2022",Color: Denim | Option: Without Kindle Unlimited | Offer Type: Lockscreen Ad-Supported,True,"Biggest difference between the Kindle (2022) and the Paperwhite (2021) is the price -- the Paperwhite is $40 more for half the storage.The screen looks the same to me, albeit 0.8 inches diagonally bigger for the Paperwhite. They both are excellent in full sun and have the same screen resolution. The Paperwhite has some additional LEDs that allow users to switch to a ""warm"" light that I personally never use and don't like.The price differential comes mainly in the screen size, the battery and the quality of the case. The Kindle is advertised as running for 6 weeks (half an hour a day) on a charge and the Paperwhite for 10 weeks. The Kindle also charges faster, leading me to the conclusion that its battery is smaller. The Paperwhite screen is flush with the case, as one would expect from a mobile phone. The Kindle has a screen inset in a plastic frame, giving a clear impression of a cheaper device. The result is that the Kindle is not rated for water resistance, while the Paperwhite is IPX8.  But I didn't buy my Kindle for how it feels but rather how it operates, and in that respect I really don't see much difference in the Kindle and the Paperwhite. They seem to work the same, the screens are equally readable, and both have more storage than I use and run longer than I need them to on a charge.I found both devices sluggish to operate and underpowered. This is especially obvious to anyone who has used the Kindle app on their phone or PC. I thought the user interface was not very responsive and not well designed. Both are very annoying in that they turn off automatically after a relatively short inaction period and I could find no setting to change the value -- power saving is either on or off. This is a real pain when I use my Kindle to follow a recipe when I'm cooking.So I rated the Kindle (2022) highly and a far better value than the Paperwhite (2021). The only good reason I can think of for getting the Paperwhite is if you like to read in the rain. With that said, Amazon occasionally offers deep discounts on the Paperwhite, so that's something to look out for.Hints: Put your contact information on a card between the Kindle and whatever your case you buy. Don't store any private information on a Kindle. Don't waste your money on an ""ad free"" version. All that does is remove ads from the ""lock screen"" that you never see except when turning the device on. Either way, once on, it will try to sell you stuff.",75 people found this helpful

It seems much faster if I buy book on phone or tablet and just download by clicking when new book icon appears on the reader. Things I miss compared to my tablet is that you cannot choose a color when highlighting. I  use color highlights to mean different things.

No matter how much I‚Äôm into a book, if I‚Äôm reading on my phone I find that I‚Äôm just constantly switching to other apps and doing other things. And E-ink is still just a slightly nicer reading experience, especially in sunlight or other bright lights. I don‚Äôt really know about eye strain that people talk about with phones. I never get strain from my phone as far as I can tell. I think phones are perfectly pleasant for reading most of the time.

"Kindle (2022 release) ‚Äì The lightest and most compact Kindle, now with a 6‚Äù 300 ppi high-resolution display, and 2x the storage - Black",5.0,Hello shelf space,"Reviewed in the United States on November 26, 2022",Color: Black | Option: Without Kindle Unlimited | Offer Type: Lockscreen Ad-Supported,True,"The shelf space you‚Äôll save alone makes this a wise purchase.  Not to mention Kindle versions are WAY cheaper than print versions.  I‚Äôve been snagging up books on my shopping lists for anywhere from 20 cents to a dollar.  This is my first time purchasing a Kindle, or E-reader period.  My first impression out of the box was that it was kinda small, but after using it, I‚Äôve realized the size is pretty much equivalent to most paperback books. Anything bigger might be too big to comfortably grip for long periods.  It‚Äôs extremely light also, so holding it for a couple of hours won‚Äôt be a struggle.  The screen is basic black and white like previous Kindles.  I initially bumped the screen brightness up to 18% because it seemed dim, but that drained the battery significantly.  After researching (googling) the problem, the suggested brightness level is 10-12%.  After switching it, I haven‚Äôt noticed the loss of charge like before.  Navigation is pretty easy ; tapping the bottom or top of the screen brings up most of what you‚Äôll need to use the device.  I would suggest installing a software update asap after getting your device, I immediately noticed performance improvement after doing so.  You have to download the update and add it to the Kindle while it‚Äôs plugged into a computer, then install the update through the Kindle.  Reading books on this thing is a relief to your eyeballs after staring at phones and tablets.  It‚Äôs very similar to reading a paper copy of a book.  I do miss the feeling of accomplishment when turning a page in a book, but I guess a screen tap will have to do.  I highly suggest getting the canvas cover offered with the Kindle for $25.99.  It‚Äôs a little pricy for a case, but it‚Äôs high quality, looks good, and magnetic so it snaps to the back while reading so as to not be bothersome.  You also get 4 months of Kindle Unlimited free, which is usually $10 a month.  I say go for it.",38 people found this helpful

Now if you're someone who would prefer to have the cover of the book you are reading on the screen, I would spend the extra 20 dollars for the ad free version, but if you're like me then save that $20 and buy the ad supported version, it shows you other books you can buy from the Kindle store and that's the only ads I have seen in the month I have own this Kindle. But features wise, this Kindle was exactly what I was looking for: easy to use, not too many extra features, it's really easy to get my library books that I borrow from Libby onto my Kindle and the battery life is really excellent and I read A Lot. It's exactly what it advertises: Basic. If you're looking for something that's more flashy or has more than just the basic features I would go for something else, but this Kindle is a really good first-time e-reader for someone who may have never had one before. I can honestly say having this e-reader has made a marked improvement on my ability to read ebooks, it was hard on my eyes to read for hours on end on my phone and the e-reader is much more gentle on my eyes.",15 people found this helpful

The first model I owned was the fourth generation $79 model back from 2011, then I had the 2015 Kindle Paperwhite and owned that for several years. I decided to upgrade to the latest 2022 basic model, and I have to say that this is my favorite Kindle I've owned to date.Initially I was going to settle on one of the newer Paperwhite models for their larger, 6.8"" display but I didn't really like the material that the screen was made out of. It felt too cheap and looked too glossy, and the flushed screen design didn't appeal to me so I brought it back. It felt too much like a small tablet and not like a simple e-reader like my older Paperwhite did. I then considered getting the previous basic Kindle model from last year but the 168 DPI screen didn't appeal to me, so I chose this one instead once I found out about it.And let me just say that for the record, this is absolutely worth every dollar. It's essentially a basic entry-level Kindle model, with upgraded features that you would have seen on an older Paperwhite such as the 300 DPI screen resolution, and also USB-C charging which is fantastic because that doesn't break as easily, and the text looks sharp and crisp. The responsiveness is just about flawless and battery life is as good as it's always been, especially if your backlight isn't too bright and you have airplane mode on. While the screen size is standard, the body of the device is trimmed down to give it extra portability factor, making it perfect to fit in small bags or purses.If you think about it, this Kindle model is kind of like a mini Paperwhite. You might not have extra features such as a slightly bigger display and backlight color temperature settings, but I don't ask for too much out of a simple e-reader and the upgrades from previous generation models is so worth it.One thing that I would absolutely recommend is to buy a case for this thing as soon as you get it, or have it shipped with a case. I'm using the official fabric cover case and it's incredibly sleek and keeps my device from getting dirty or scratched up.",43 people found this helpful

I bought my first Kindle Paperwhite in 2014. Although I have bought every generation of the Paperwhite ever since, I found that I did most of my ebook reading on my laptop, cell phone, or desktop. I'm not sure why that was, but I think it was because it was convenient.When Kindle Basic was issued, I didn't give it much thought; I thought of it as a cheaper version of the Paperwhite, not quite as good but suitable for those who couldn't afford a more expensive e-reader. Yet one of my anxieties about investing so much in Kindle e-books over the years- I now have over 5,000- is that I dreaded having to shell out about $200 for each new reading device any time I lost one, or it became unusable. $200 each time seemed too much to pay.On top of that, I found that I wasn't using the device as much anyway because I couldn't slip it into my pocket like a mass-market paperback. When I wanted to sit down and read, why would I use my Paperwhite when I could just as easily -- and more comfortably -- use my laptop?  The cell phone seemed to be a quicker and better option when I was on the go.The Kindle Basic is lighter, making it more convenient to use. It is smaller, making it more fun and easier to carry with me.The Kindle Basic is not unreasonably small, like a cell phone, and it is not as clunky as a laptop. It is just the right size, like a small paperback, only much lighter and thinner and good for reading in the dark or outside on a windy day and indoors anytime. The text is clear and sharp, like a more expensive Kindle. Best of all, it is affordable, so I don't have to worry about replacing it. In a nutshell: the Kindle Basic makes reading easier and more pleasurable than the more expensive models.",30 people found this helpful

My grandson likes playing on my phone, so I bought this to read on while he's on the phone. First, to ""sync"" to my phone and do a quick setup, I had to upgrade the Kindle app on my phone. Which then got rid of my ability to purchase books on my phone due to ""play store rules"". Horribly inconvenient and on top of it, the sync never worked (after trying for over 30 minutes). I finally just did the setup myself.Now I can buy books on this device, so if I'm reading on my phone, I have to open this device, hope it syncs to the last page, do the buy on the kindle. BUT then if I want to continue reading on the kindle, I have to X out of that screen, go back to the last book, reopen the store, and hope it lets me read the book. It has never once just let me click the read now button and go forward.I will say most of the time opening a book on one device and then the other, it syncs to the latest page read, which is fantastic!! Sometimes it doesn't and it's a massive pain to find the right page. And the kindle will give you the option to jump forward, but then the same screen stays up and gives you the option to jump back where you were. Took me a minute to realize what was happening, but now I know!Clicking pages forward or backwards is hit or miss - sometimes it goes forward when I tap on the right, sometimes back, sometimes it skips 3 or 4 pages. Sometimes it works ok, but OMG is it a frustrating device. I was reading on a Nook in 2010 that worked better than this!!  The technology has been there for over a decade, why is this so crappy? And the nook was cheaper than this thing is!! I switched to kindle for the free book subscription.I paid the extra for the no ads, which supposedly puts the cover of the book you're reading on the lock screen. Nope, it just puts random designs, but they stay there between books and just randomly change. They are never the cover of the book I'm reading, which is absolutely fine, but don't lie about what we're buying.This is extremely light weight, almost disconcertingly so, which is a plus. I had to stop reading paper due to the pain in my hands. It doesn't fit much on a page for my aging eyes (I'm only in my 40s but losing my near sightedness). I was expecting more to a page than on my phone, but it's really about the same size just wider and shorter. Battery life is ok - I've had about 3 weeks and already had to charge it once and it's at 30% again. I read for max 2 hours a day on this device and the rest of the time on the phone.So, overall, it does what I bought it for, badly, but it does it. I do NOT recommend this product, especially for the price. I'm a little shocked at how poorly Amazon produced this product.",3 people found this helpful

I don't like reading books on my iPad. I read a lot and don't like accumulating hardback books. Kindles are perfect for me. I've upgraded my devices every few years. Although it's not considered an upgrade, this model was my favorite of all:  loved the size, the weight, the screen (very easy to read), the battery life. Loved everything about it. What's bad is that it ""died"" within 4 months of getting it.I never had a problem with all my other Kindles. I hope the problem is not a design flaw and that it will last as long as my others. If it doesn't ""die"" I strongly recommend this model.It was disappointing when it ""died"" and I have explained what happened at the end of this review. It's probably too much detail but it is what it is.I was in the middle of a book when it ""died"", so first, I ordered another one just like this one (reduced from $100 to $75) because I didn't want to wait the time it would take, once I found the right person to speak with at Amazon, for them to either fix this broken one or for them to send me a new one after mailing it back to them.I called Amazons Kindle help line to get an answer to this problem. They were great to work with and are crediting the purchase, and I am mailing the broken one back. I am satisfied with how the issue was resolved. The order I placed for a new one, and paid for, will be delivered tomorrow.Exactly what went wrong:The problem started when I couldn't find it - I left it (the new blue one) on the treadmill on the 2nd floor. Because I couldn't find it, I got an old black Kindle out, charged it, downloaded the book I was reading, and was finishing the book when my husband found the blue Kindle on the treadmill. I turned the blue one on - no problem - and began scrolling to the page where I left off on the old black one. Then everything on the screen went black. The green light was still on, but when I pressed the on-off button, the green light stayed on for only 2 seconds and the screen remained black. I plugged it in thinking it needed a charge. When plugged in, after about 10 minutes, the ""sleep"" screen came on. I unplugged it, pushed the on-off button, and the screen went black. I pressed the on-off button again and the green light was on for about 2 seconds. The screen remained black. I went through this process numerous times: sleep screen came on after about 5 or 10 minutes when it was left alone or plugged in, the green light remained on during this time, when I pressed the on-off button the screen turned black again. Every time I pressed the on-off button, the green light would go off in 2 seconds. I kept going through this process numerous times and the result was the same. That's when I ordered a new one and decided to figure out how and who to contact at Amazon the next day.Again, I never had a problem with all the other Kindles. This is my favorite for the reasons I have already mentioned. I hope the problem is not a design flaw and that it will last as long as my others. If it doesn't ""die"" again, I strongly recommend this model.",4 people found this helpful

The only reason I bought this was for the backlight, which really is great and doesn't hurt the eyes.This version is super light and fairly slippery, making it uncomfortable to hold. Gone is that slightly non slip backing. Definitely a form over function design. A small bevel is not ideal for comfort.The swipe vs button for page changing means if you are holding it with your left hand, you have to move your right hand from resting to turn the page. It's just one of those things that a physical button makes for a more enjoyable experience.The touch only can also be a pain when wanting to use the dictionary. Sometimes it will turn the page, several times I don't know what I did but it took me several chapters ahead.Seems like it was designed not by an avid kindle user.I'll get a case which I think will help for holding.

The screen is the same size at 6 inches as my Paperwhite 2014. I did purchase the Paperwhite Signature and decided to return it. The weight and size were bugging me on the Paperwhite Signature. Also, there seemed to be more glaring on the Paperwhite than this basic Kindle. There‚Äôs no warm light but I have no issues without it. If I‚Äôm tired, no amount of blue or green or strobing lights will keep me awake. If the Paperwhite Signature were the same size and weight as this Kindle, I would have kept the Signature instead. I read a lot and I have no issues with this edition of the Kindle. My only grip with the Kindle (all editions), there is no text to speech like on the Kindle app. The Accessibility text to speech means it will read everything on the screen and makes navigation awkward and difficult.

"Kindle (2022 release) ‚Äì The lightest and most compact Kindle, now with a 6‚Äù 300 ppi high-resolution display, and 2x the storage - Black",1.0,Prefer my Fire HD,"Reviewed in the United States on January 3, 2023",Color: Denim | Option: Without Kindle Unlimited | Offer Type: Lockscreen Ad-Supported,True,"NOTE FOLLOW UP EDIT AFTER BELOW REVIEWI wanted to like this device after reading the reviews.  I dropped my Fire HD 8 (10th gen) and the screen cracked down the middle but it is still very readable.  It is a fairly heavy device with the kickstand cover on it, so poked around to see what I could replace it with‚Äîsince I really don‚Äôt tap into all of its computing power and apps.  I was intrigued by a lighter device that would also be readable outdoors in the sun.  I‚Äôm afraid, however, that this Kindle Basic is just too basic.  My primary source of reading material is the library. Overdrive was my download platform, and then my library switched to Libby. You cannot download either of these apps to the 11th gen Basic. In fact, you cannot download any apps, and the web browsing experience is dreadful. If latency and stuttering bother you, you will hate this.  So in order to download from the library you have to use another device and then point that device to this device to download the book. Not a huge hassle, but having all of your interactivity on a single device is where I want to be. Regarding the performance of the Basic:  the page turns are definitely not as quick and crisp as the Fire. It is slower, and there is a tad bit of latency.  If you read at night next to your significant other, the ‚ÄúDark Mode‚Äù on this device is more gray than it is black. Definitely inferior to the blacks that Fire offers.  If you enjoy seeing the the full color covers of the books you read‚Äîyou won‚Äôt be doing that here.  Finally, the size is just too small for my liking. Why not just read on your phone if this is the size you are looking for?  Lastly, I don‚Äôt trust all of the reviews boasting about battery life. Mine arrived at 53%, and by the time I was done with Amazon Kindle Support on the phone to confirm the web and app limitations the battery was down to 43% after also running a book download experiment by installing the Libby app on my phone and pointing the download at the new Basic. The Basic is now back in its shipping box with the return label attached and ready for a drop off at UPS.********Follow up:I have received my new Fire 7 (see picture above) and have achieved all of the goals I set out to accomplish.  The photo compares it to my Fire 8 HD (with a vertically cracked screen that you can‚Äôt really see).  Initially I had the 8HD for traveling and downloading movies. I don‚Äôt do much traveling anymore, but if I want to download content, I figured I can just use my MacBook with Retina screen for that.  And besides, all of the reviews for the Fire 7 say it is hard to tell that there is no HD since it is a small screen experience that you are only 2-3 feet away from. I don‚Äôt disagree. The great news is that without HD there is not as much processing speed required, so you end up with a MUCH lighter devise. As an ebook reader the performance mirrors the 8HD: crisp precise page turns, etc.  As you can see in the photo, the white background, however, is a little warmer, which I don‚Äôt mind at all. The mori√© effect on the Fire 7 pic is just a byproduct of the photo, and it does not look distorted in real life.  The weight of the Fire 7 and the cover with kickstand and hand strap that I have ordered is just over 15oz, which is just under 1 lb.‚Äîthe weight of the average hardback.  Perfect.  Smaller and more manageable, lighter, excellent performance, the ability to download apps, a good web browser, ability to download content up to 16GB, and MUCH CHEAPER than the Basic Kindle.  The only thing that Basic Kindle will do better is allow you to read in direct sunlight‚Äîwhich I rarely do anyway since I am usually active when in direct sunlight.  5 stars for the Kindle Fire 7.",17 people found this helpful

This new Kindle is really comparable to the 2018 version without being waterproof.  I think the build is sleek.  It may not be premium but it's nice.  If you plan to use a case you aren't going to notice anyway. The text seems crisper with sunken bezel screen vs. the flush screen of the Paperwhite.  This Kindle is really all that is needed to have good reading experience since it has dark mode for night time reading.  The 6 inch screen is more than adequate for reading.  It only has 4 leds lights, but without the extra layer of plastic/glass on the screen the background of the screen seems about as bright as the Paperwhite which has more lights, when used at the same brightness level. Unless you read in the  bath you don't really need the waterproofing.  I read outside sometimes and the previous basic Kindle has gotten raindrops on it with no issue's.

Though I will probably get a paperwhite sometime for home. This will certainly stay my work and travel E-Reader. First of all, charging with USB-C is wonderful, as almost everything is USB-C these days, and not needing to dig for a micro is very nice. It's super lightweight as well, especially if you have just the Kindle itself. I got a case for it as I don't like damaging my products in any way, and I read before bed, so it's not always out of the question for it to get dropped.It does, however, have it's downsides. When bringing the device to a higher brightness, it has an odd hue to it. But, I can get past that for the price. When you put a case on it, it can get fairly heavy. Though, compared to a book, it's still like a feather. And, the power button on the bottom is a little odd, but, I think I do prefer it there. It's just a bit odd to get used to at first.With all of this said, this Kindle is great for either a first E-Reader, a device for a child to read on, or a travel reader. As it fits in most pockets and certainly any handbag, it's an incredible way to make sure you're entertained wherever you go.I highly recommend for anyone looking for something to read on the go!",16 people found this helpful

I tried to live with the new paper white but perhaps I‚Äôm just too basic lol.

It‚Äôs so simple and easy to hold, no frills and basic, much the same as a traditional paper book would be. The screen in my opinion reads more like an actual book than the paper white. I appreciate the simplicity of it, as I feel most things these days go overboard with features.My only gripe would be the feel. I saw another review mention it also, the plastic feels a bit underwhelming. I do wish it would have the same texture as the other models. However this is something that will just take getting acclimated.All the models have their perspective buyers and you really cannot go wrong with any, it‚Äôs simply up to personal taste.

I wish it were just a little more sensitive to touch. I have also noticed that sometimes if I tap the screen to turn the page, it will turn two or three pages ahead and that has happened quite a few times. I then need to go back and find my spot in the book which is a bit irritating. In some ways, I wish I had bought the oasis so that these problems could have been avoided with the buttons that kindle has. Lastly I have noticed when reading that occasionally the whole screen will change from dark mode to day mode/vice versa quickly when I turn the page. That‚Äôs a little irritating at night when I have it on dark mode and it will flash bright for a second when I don‚Äôt expect it. Over all though I do like this kindle. I like how small it is and how I can easily take it in my purse or bag anywhere. I just wish these little glitches didn‚Äôt happen so often.

I have read close to 4 books on this thing and it‚Äôs only at 53%. I do keep it on airplane mode when I‚Äôm not buying from the store, but this is still incredibly impressive. The only thing I don‚Äôt like is the power button on the bottom, I feel like I have to hold it weird. But other than that, if you‚Äôre thinking of buying a basic ereader that isn‚Äôt fancy and does the job, this is an incredible choice.",5 people found this helpful

My first book did it and my last Paperwhite did it also.Also some people complain about the ADs it's literally only the lock screen. You will get recommendations on books based off of what you read but none of these features interrupt while reading.Love that it is a USB-C charger. The micro USB was annoying in my opinion. Also this kindle gets way darker screen which is perfect because I read at night in the dark.It also connected to my Kindle phone app and was super easy to set up!!!

Someone who wants a smaller more portable Kindle is probably going to carry it in places where it can get wet (as opposed to a larger one that probably never leaves the house).

Right is the Paperwhite 7th generation. The left is the new Kindle 2022 release. Even though both have 300ppi, the contrast is better on the Paperwhite.

Yawn gasp!During the apocalypse she thought it was a good idea to get a subscription to a thing called comixology.. which in and of itself is a great app but realizing how poor it displays on the Kindle.. was beyond disappointingI felt like I was at my grandma's house in 1982 watching the black and white TV in the back room cuz they didn't want me breathing in all the ciggye smoke.In many ways it helped me reminisce of how far we've come along in our society.  This thing would have been so cool in 1990 along with the other LCD video games that were around like game boy or whatever else..I have to admit the only Superior thing to this product is that it had a backlight which you would have to purchase in the 90s for your LCD powered productsbut this has it in spades every time you change the page it flashes the color of the original page during dark mode so it blinds you slightly.. so you can look for your text on the next screen blind.This feature really helped me get to sleep at night time after I blasted my eyes through 30 pages of a really boring book.After wearing sunglasses to bed I felt that it was a more easy way to enjoy my Kindle paper backI wanted to give it more stars I was super excited it pretty much ruined my whole entire day expectation loss of excitement pretty much ruined my whole day and part of the next.Fortunately for me I have Amazon Prime so I just wasted a bunch more money on some other crappy device from another crappy manufacturer that I'll probably also be unhappy with but you know that's how it is nowadaysThanks o bama,5 people found this helpful

"Kindle (2022 release) ‚Äì The lightest and most compact Kindle, now with a 6‚Äù 300 ppi high-resolution display, and 2x the storage - Black",2.0,Annoying,"Reviewed in the United States on February 10, 2023",Color: Denim | Option: Without Kindle Unlimited | Offer Type: Lockscreen Ad-Supported,True,"This is my 3rd Kindle. For the first time I am disappointed. I don't know if it's the material or that's it's so lightweight, but I can't move it around in one hand without it slipping around. A LOT.  It feels really fragile, probably a trade-off to being so lightweight. I'd rather have a bit more weight than these issues, which I didn't have with the previous versions that I didn't think were too heavy. My previous Kindle bought in 2016 had the power button on the back, top right corner. I could turn it on easily with one hand. This bottom button requires me to use two hands or brace it against my body. I don't like the thin sides. They are narrower than my thumbs, and I have small hands, so I can't comfortably grip it on the side. I also don't like the recessed screen. I miss my page turn buttons on the side, which allowed me to turn the page without moving my hand, and go to the previous page without setting it down or having to use two hands. I also don't like having to tap twice to get to the brightness screen, and then not be able to see the print when I'm changing it, to see how bright is necessary. The amount of brightness showing on a mostly blank settings page is different than with a full page of print. So I have to go back and forth to adjust it several times, holding it with two hands because if my thumb is off the side it will fall out of my hand. These things seem nitpicky, but when you're holding a baby, they matter! I don't want to be frustrated picking up my Kindle (slips out of my grip), holding it (side too small), turning it on (can't do one handed), and turning pages (no side buttons). Basically every aspect of this Kindle is annoying me. I'll use it, because it's amazingly convenient compared to an actual book, but as far as Kindles go, it's a huge disappointment. I'd give it a one star but I like the dark mode option, so I'll give it two.",One person found this helpful

And I have to add that charging $20 to have them removed is pretty low. The older Kindels were the best I have ever encountered & lasted forever without fail. The setup for this readeris messy and awkward, with slides & left arrows are mentioned, yet not on many screens. As for the dark mode, it isn't even close. The only way you can call it dark mode is if the background is totally black; not gray, not dark gray. White font will not show easily & you will end up with eye strain. It is totally easy to accomplish this; the previous Kindle fire was supurb in dark mode.  As for loading books you think we might like should be eliminated; it takes up space for books we do want, & is annoying to have to address them to get them off. This is not a magazine; it is a place to relax & read in peace. I am also worried about not being able to order ebooks from the net or our computers; this may be a red flag for a lot of us.

The new 2022 Kindle was a gift from my husband who heard my grumbling from the adjacent seat.Today, I opened the box and powered on the Kindle 2022, only to discover some hateful interface designer thinks ENORMOUS thumbnail images are better than seeing more list items on a single page. I disagree, and will not keep this device if it prioritizes images over words, and showing more Amazon sales prompts over making reading a seamless, pleasant experience.I use my Kindle every day, and often for hours at a time. If the interface is bad, I'll carry a power bank and stick with my old Voyage if I can't find somewhere online to get a battery replacement (or a new-to-me additional Voyage in better condition.)I can't evaluate the Battery Life for this review as I don't think I'll have this device long enough to discover whether the hardware itself is any good.The touchscreen seems responsive, but I was very reluctant to give up my physical page turn buttons for this new model anyway, so I'm not the best judge for this feature.I was so excited by this gift, and now I'm utterly disappointed. My husband found people online discussing how to jailbreak the device to go back to old software. I don't want to do that. Amazon has done enough things right with the Kindle reading ecosystem that I was willing to stick with it. If they move away from e-readers as devices FOR PEOPLE WHO LOVE WORDS, they will lose my e-book business.Everyone who hates the new list interface must visit customer service and report it. Hopefully someone will listen. Keep the people who love pictures designing book covers, and ask actual readers what they value in a ""List View"" of their library. I'd guess most of us prefer to see the TITLE and AUTHOR in a clear font, ideally with an adjustable size as we can do inside the book reading view.Personally, I want to view as many titles per page as possible in my chosen font size! Seeing four titles per page makes it more difficult to find what I want if I'm browsing by flicking through the list, and it doesn't even allow me to see just those volumes I'm actively reading at one time. (I tend to keep 5-6 books in active rotation at any given time.)Epic fail on the latest Kindle interface.",11 people found this helpful

It takes two hands to use and while it's easy to read the print in bed, it's too small to be propped to rest on one's side and use only one hand. I'm getting a cover, hoping it will help to hold it.

Interface-wise, I would have liked to combine list view with collections instead of an either/or, but maybe I just need to play with it more.

Had to swipe back a page at a time until I finally recognized where I should be. No logical indicators at bottom of screen to tell where in the book you were. Hightlighting is a real downgrade. Also, font size not as adjustable as my older Kindle. All in all, not a good reading experience! If I had never had a Kindle before, I might have like this better. I wanted something I could read in bright light (which is not good on my phone), but couldn't get past all these things that seemed like downgrades from my old Kindle. If it hadn't died, I would still be using it.

And there is only one line of covers for books I have bought, and multiple lines of books Amazon is trying to sell me.Further, under the old system I could remove a book from the Kindle and keep it in the cloud.  Now, if I 'delete the download' the book cover remains on the Kindle taking up space.  If I want to delete the cover I have to delete the book from the cloud which means if I ever want to go back to the book I have to buy it again.

It does have a browser but it would not load even on good WIFI.‚Ä¢How drawn out it is to send books to the Kindle from my library's Libby app.  It didn't register that I had Kindle unlimited so I had to do this extra step to read for free.‚Ä¢The ads on the lock screen - now note, I knew about this when I bought it.

I‚Äôll start with positives because it‚Äôs a shorter list, it‚Äôs light weight, the swiping features/dark mode are nice, and just like that we have concluded the positives. I wish it had more length because when you go to turn the pages I seem to be always toggling the settings a lot more than actually turning the page. I had one of the very first kindles with keyboards and even back then the whole point of a kindle was that it dimmed and brightened to fit your environment without disrupting your reading experience. The page refresh and how you can see words on the previous page and options you‚Äôve selected is atrocious (other commenters are calling it screen burn) if you read fan fiction on your kindle this is not the kindle for you the screen burn/refresh issue makes it a jumbled mess of the pages and you cant read anything.

My Kindle Paperwhite is barely usable. All of the damn People magazines published since the Paperwhite came out are impossible to remove. I can't get to the books I want to read without a lot of patience while wading through all those issues. The scroll-down in the Library freezes. It takes 30 minutes to open another book. If I accidently touch the screen while reading a book, the story skips backward or forward 3 or 4 pages. Sometimes, it goes to the beginning. The Table of Contents doesn't like to scroll once you get to the bottom of the list on the first page. If I'm on Chapter 42 and the bottom TOC page is at Chapter 39, I can't get it to move at all. I just take a guess at the location and keep using the location finder to get close to where I need to get back to when I was thrown off. Then, I page forward page by page to find where I was reading. Today, I tried to use a link at the end of a book to order the next book in the series. When it got to Amazon, the typeface was too small to read. It refused to be resized. It got too big and then back to too small. I finally got out a magnifier and typed in my name and password. It kept telling me that my password was incorrect. I'm doing this review on my phone. The convenience of a smaller reader is not worth the navigation aggravation.",

Battery lasts now up to 6 weeks with 30 min daily use, compared to 4 weeks with same use in previous version. (Actual battery life varies with use)-USB-C: Now using USB-C charging port instead of outdated micro-USB in previous version-SIZE/WEIGHT: Slightly smaller frame although same size screen, slightly lighter compared to previous version (2022 version is 6.2‚Äù x 4.3‚Äù x 0.32‚Äù and 5.56 oz, 2019 version was 6.3‚Äù x 4.5‚Äù x 0.34‚Äù and 6.1 oz)Also, this 11th generation version uses 75% post-consumer recycled plastics in the Black color device, (only 30% in Denim color device).  This percentage of recycled content has been steadily increasing with new Kindle devices.  Last year‚Äôs Paperwhite had 60% post-consumer recycled plastics.Overall, this is a nice upgrade over the last generation of Kindle.  These devices have always been targeted at avid readers that want the most paper-like reading experience, and this newest version adds double the storage space, longer battery life, faster charging options, USB-C and a higher resolution screen.  This regular kindle screen now looks about as good as the Paperwhite version from last year.  (Note that this Kindle screen isn‚Äôt waterproof though, it does NOT have the same IPX8 rating of the Paperwhite)For me, being able to finally use the same USB-C chargers that I use for everything else is a big deal.  Having the same ppi screen resolution as the Paperwhite is also pretty nice.  As a family that reads TONS of eBooks, we will definitely be using a few of these.  When comparing to the previous version, the difference is noticeable right away; if you like the way the 2021 Paperwhite looked, you will probably like this new Kindle also because the screen resolution is almost the same.We are loving these so far.  Sometimes it is nice to have a dedicated reading device, free from other distractions, and without eye-strain problems.  Avid readers know how bad glare and eyestrain can be, so devices like this make a big difference.",102 people found this helpful

Difficulty these days trying to buy such an old Kindle, so decided to get a new one - 11th Gen - for just reading at a recent good price (and paying $$s for supressing ads!) and found out it's quite lightweight and smaller - about the only thing goods I can say!  When you were reading something (on older Kindles), you could advance pages by a simple swipe of the finger to advance or go back. THIS Kindle, however, seems to want to to jump several pages frequently.  It is often VERY difficult to go back, and then is seems to want to go several pages at a time.  Really a poor product (awkward to use) and could never recommend to anyone.  Maybe Amazon will read this and reach out to me to tell me I should only lightly tap or some new such technique.  I've already tried that, too, to no avail.  No recommendation for this Kindle from this user.  Oh, BTW, the portrayal of a book'sa charts and graphs is horrible - cannot read print (it's very light gray) and though you can expand it, it is very awkward to get a zoomed graph that you can read well - often it will give the graphic, but you cannot see the details of the side and bottom of the chart or graph.  Truly as bad as my 5th Gen Kindles!  Maybe I need to go to reading on my iPad.  This is NOT an improved product! Update, after calls form Cust Support offering return an refund:  Really, REALLY aggravating to use!  Loses the book pages and %-progress after some few page turns.  Also CANNOT get to asterisk-footnotes...all I get are ""Wikipedia has no entries."" Need to try multiple times to get to the footnote. (I am a 6-footer with pretty large hanbds so the little asterisk is hard to directly hit.) And pages jump all around - goes forward a few, and hard to get it going backwards to get back to where you where reading (aggravated by usually no way to know the exact page or %-progress in book!  And did I say it is VERY lousy/poor trying to read graphs and charts and anything like an illustration.  Grey tones leave any print in lowest resolution of grey! m And I do not need an Amazon CSR calling and offering me to get a Fire or other item.  Bottom Line: Most recent Kindle is a POS! Don't waste your money! SCREWED UP, CRIPPLED PRODUCT!  Who else make a book reader?",9 people found this helpful

And , LORD HAVE MERCY, those page turn buttons.  I've owned every kindle from the keyboard to the TOL oasis'. I bought a basic kindle and I gotta tell you. I didn't understand or use the warm light correctly, so no loss.32 gigs of storage? Amazon does an amazing job of keeping your books stored on the cloud. So that's no loss. The 7 in screen is nice. But no. I lose shit, everything. Phones, computers, tablets, phones including a folding screen RAZR  i haven't lost it ... Yet. LoL so, $99 I could buy and replace 4 of these for one of those. So. Bottom line. I get a better battery and the same e ink screen. Plus the new one is so light. I wish I could trust myself without a case, but major klutz. The clear case In the photo almost triples the weight of the device. Check how much ithr case weighs. Sorry for rambling. Old age happens to everybody. I take the cass off when I'm at home.

Unless, you're like me and won't be happy until you get one, the oasis price tag is justified, it's machined aluminum a huge battery. I felt like Oprah, walking around the hospital in my gown with an extra one to keep my private parts private, I really felt like a  celebrity walking around the hospital, smoking weed and reading ony oasis.

"Kindle (2022 release) ‚Äì The lightest and most compact Kindle, now with a 6‚Äù 300 ppi high-resolution display, and 2x the storage - Black",5.0,Excellent entry level Kindle -- has a hidden bargain for removing the ad-filled screensaver,"Reviewed in the United States on October 18, 2022",Color: Denim | Option: Without Kindle Unlimited | Offer Type: Lockscreen Ad-Supported,True,"I have two 32GB Kindle Oasis that have several valuable features that this Kindle does not BUT they cost several hundred dollars more. They're great devices but expensive. So I just bought this basic Kindle for carrying around in my purse.The screen is about the same height for both Kindle models but the width of the basic Kindle screen is noticeably narrower than that of the Oasis. The basic Kindle's case is made of mostly recycled plastic and all movement among options are accomplished by sweeping your finger across the screen -- no buttons.Because the case is plastic rather than metal, this basic Kindle weighs about an ounce less which matters when carried around all day. The power button would be better on the top of the Kindle but I am pleased that it uses USB-C rather than the archaic mini-USB that the Oasis still uses. The16GB storage is quite generous and better than the base Paperwhite model. This uses wifi only and doesn't offer a cellular optionI find the basic Kindle's screen remarkably good despite being lit by so few LEDs. The screen is the same 300 ppi as all other Kindles but appears slightly ¬†less crisp because of the basic model's 4 LEDs. I find it easy on my eyes however.I was pleasantly surprised to learn that the ad-filled screensaver can be easily removed FOR FREE (but only if you call in) because the Content and Devices, Devices, page for your Kindle will say the removal is free. Alternatively, rather than paying $20 more to purchase the Kindle without that screensaver, you can call to have it removed for $15.The issue is not the content of the screensaver. It's that any cover with a magnetic closure stops on the ad screensaver but opens directly to the book you were reading with the standard screensaver. I believe that both the free and $15 prices for removal are in error so I would suggest having the ad-filled screensaver removed immediately.I encourage you to accept the free four months of Kindle Unlimited included with current purchases. KU allows you to select (and keep indefinitely) up to 20 items. This is a bargain worth $40 so why leave money on the table?Also for the cash-conscious, other than using those four free months of KU, do use your library card to connect your new Kindle to the Libby app. The app will search for Kindle books at your library and will, after setup, load your library books onto your Kindle. These free books automatically vanish when your lending period is over.You can also save by checking to see if friends or family have an old Kindle they're not using (working or not). Even the oldest Kindle can be traded in for a cash payment (which may be as little as $10) but the trade-in also gives you 20% off your next new Kindle. I have seen certified, refurbished basic Kindles offered at $79  -- but remember that price doesn't include the four months of KU and it may or may not include free removal of ad screensaver so are not the bargain they appear to be.Three items to tweak in Settings. If you open any book, and tap the top of the page and then the Aa, you can select your own default font, font size, and page setup which will be used for everything you read from then on. I use Helvetica with one unit of bold, size 5 or 6. My layout uses the left option for all four choices. In the More tab ¬†in the same area, you can turn off being notified about how many times various passages have been highlighted by other readers. I also suggest that you use Settings, Device Options, and tap on Display Cover so that the screensaver is the cover of the book you're reading and Settings, Device Options, Advanced, Home & Library, to group your books into series.¬†I've had Kindles since the first one offered and am never without one in reach. They allow me to read in small bits anywhere. They're great! I continue to be quite happy with my Oasis for reading at home but think this basic Kindle will be a workhorse for carrying around. The reduced size, weight, and cost make this a buy at $99.NOTE: The one downside for some people will be that this Kindle is not waterproof like the Paperwhite and Oasis. I have taken my Kindles to the beach and the tub without ever getting one wet. BUT, if you are someone who must have waterproof, this isn't it.",571 people found this helpful

Even though it's smaller and lighter in weight, the actual screen size is identical.  This lighter model is perfectly sized for travel and I can barely notice it when carrying in my purse.  Haven't noticed much difference in readability and price was higher than my original purchase.  But needless to say, it's been 8 years and with a little luck, I'll be using this reader 8 years from now!",

The lack of built-in front-lighting had been bugging me for a while (and the Amazon-made cover with pull-out light was fair-to-middling at best), so it was clearly time for a replacement. The Oasis was, to me, needlessly expensive: a metal casing that was both cold to the touch (bad) and prone to scratches/dents/Et Cetera (worse); the Paperwhite Signature Edition seemed nice, but (1) was also pricey, (2) had almost too much storage at 32GB (whereas the 8GB ""standard"" Paperwhite was too little, and probably due for a product refresh anyway), and (3) that flush, ""bezelless"" screen‚Ä¶that would seem fabulous, right up to the moment you drop the thing and slide it, face-down, over something even mildly abrasive. And it's still a tad big, albeit smaller than my old Kindle.But: Amazon decided to upgrade the ""basic"" Kindle, simultaneously upping both the screen resolution (achieving essential parity with the Paperwhite) *and* storage capacity to a ""just-right"" 16GB. Combine this with a near-universally-pocketable size, while still offering a reasonably-sized 6"" screen, good front-lighting (yes, four lights, one for each side, is enough‚Ä¶I'm more concerned about evenness of illumination than sheer intensity, which in this case is also adequate to my eyes), and light weight, and I was sold. Yes, I paid for the ""privilege"" of not dealing with ads; yes, I *know* the ads are seen only on the lockscreen (and supposedly only relate to book ""recommendations"", but couldn't confirm that last bit). But  since I plan to keep this for hopefully as long as I did my old Kindle, I'd just as soon not deal with any of that, and decided I could deal with the $20 ""payoff"", if you will. The bottom line here is that you won't be missing much by choosing this Kindle over the pricier stuff (including the Scribe, unless you're into that sort of thing‚Ä¶). The smaller size of this Kindle is *very* much a plus, encouraging you to take it with you even if you have nothing more than an overcoat pocket to carry it in, because it'll most likely fit, and easily at that.

First you figured out how to avoid allowing Apple iPhone users to plug in their Kindles with the same power source wiring by refusing to shape Kindle's plug-in end to match Apple's. Now you multiply that offense by coming out with a new design for the plug-in end of your own Kindle 11 so that it won't work with your Kindle 10s. Result: most of us will have to maintain three sets of wires to run all three devices. Why did you do it this way? Profit-seeking? What else?  I can only suggest that you be careful crossing streets and do your best to keep out of sight of your customers. You now have me searching for an alternative e-phone -- something I never ever imagined doing.,
