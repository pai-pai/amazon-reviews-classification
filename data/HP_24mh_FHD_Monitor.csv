HP 24mh FHD Monitor - Computer Monitor with 23.8-Inch IPS Display (1080p) - Built-In Speakers and VESA Mounting - Height/Tilt Adjustment for Ergonomic Viewing - HDMI and DisplayPort - (1D0J9AA#ABA),5.0,A Very Satisfied Customer,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on March 9, 2023",Style: Monitor,True,"I am writing this review specifically for one major reason. Tech reviewers on YouTube and elsewhere are wont to tell you that a 27"" 1440p monitor is now the ""sweet spot"" and should now be the standard monitor size for work and gaming. A few will tell you they can't use anything less than a 32"" monitor. Well, I have a 32"" monitor and I've tried a 27"" monitor too. Actually I recently bought two 27"" monitors, but I quickly returned them. My 32"" monitor is in one of my bedrooms, and I use it every now and then.Is a 24"" monitor big enough for work and play? YES. Plenty! Some folks use a 13"" laptop for all their computer tasks. The biggest laptop in the world at this moment is the Acer Predator 21X, which has a curved 21"" screen. So, everyone who uses a laptop for their computer tasks (and there a many, very many people who work this way), do so on computer screens less then a 24"" monitor. As far as I know, there are no monitors at my place of work bigger than 24"". In one Gadget Review article, Lawrence Bonk wrote, ""Professional gamers nearly always use 24-inch monitors instead of larger monitors.""Before I go further, let me quickly say that a 24"" 1080p monitor may very well be the perfect size for any type of task you perform on a computer. It has plenty of screen real estate, and it is not overwhelming. Monitors of this size are cheaper too. A 24"" monitor doesn't have much of the wasted spaces I found on my 27"" 1440p monitors.This 24"" HP monitor has two built-in speakers (thank you, HP!). Yes, I often connect my PC via Bluetooth to my JBL Partybox 310, but I love that I have an option of using the speakers in my monitor.I did not like how texts appeared on my 27"" 1440p monitors. Because of the higher pixel density, the texts were smaller than they appeared on this HP monitor, forcing me to scale up text and picture sizes on the 27"" monitors. Without even tweaking the settings on this 24"" monitor, pictures and texts were just right. I also played some videos on both the 27"" 1440p monitor and this 24"" 1080p monitor. And frankly, the quality was either practically the same on both or even better on this 24"" 1080p monitor.I don't game. I use my computer for everyday, ordinary tasks (emails, study, paying bills, shopping, VoIP calls, video calls, video conferencing, work-related tasks, web surfing, playing music, and watching videos and movies). I can report confidently that not only is this 24"" monitor adequate for these tasks, I also prefer this monitor to the 27"" 1440p monitor (which I have already returned).Presently, I use two of this 24"" monitors in an ""Extend these displays,"" dual monitor setup. I love it, but just one monitor would have been adequate for my needs. Some bloggers are adamant that having three monitors is the best for productivity, but I found that to be counterproductive. Not only does a three-monitor setup require more desk space, it also becomes a distraction. I kept asking myself, ""What should I display on the third monitor?"" The third monitor was totally dispensable.",25 people found this helpful

Out-of-the-box assembly was pretty quick - take it out, stick the stand on, plug and play.It did take some adjustment in the on-screen menu to get the settings right. I thought the defaults a bit rough. But once the sharpness and black settings were tweaked, it was quite good. I don’t know that I would use this for hefty graphics work, but as a side monitor for watching YouTube and responding to email, it’s great for the price.After 627 hours of use, it suffered a backlight failure (picture of the failure against the backdrop of my attempt to chat with them attached). As I’m under warranty, I reached out to support. Typical large-company support situation - time-consuming and near-painful tier 1 support, having me restart and change settings. After two hours they agreed to send me a box, citing a 8-10 day turnaround. Honestly, I’m debating just buying another (or this or another brand) and calling it a day. If they find it’s damaged then I’m on the hook. I can’t fathom it would be as it hasn’t moved in 9 months.But I recognize I’m more the exception than the rule. For its price, it’s a nice, name-brand monitor for day-to-day use.",6 people found this helpful

I mostly watch old TV shows and movies so the color isn't as critical as it might be to some, but the color quality on 30 year old movies is excellent. What I can't believe is the clarity of watching old shows like Perry Mason and Dick Van Dyke. Extremely pleased.I should also comment on the volume control, as I struggled to understand it. This was part of a review written by Lindguini, so I'm plagiarizing:HOW TO FIX LOW VOLUME SOUND: The built-in speakers are better than some reviewers indicate. I believe most people don't discover that the monitor menu has its own volume control that's set to 50% volume by factory default. If you just connect this monitor to the PC you'll automatically get sound through the HP speakers via HDMI or DisplayPort (you only have to use the separate audio cable when using the VGA input). But no matter how high you turn up your PC volume control, you'll only get 50% volume from the monitor's speakers which is why people complain about low volume. To fix this, all you need to do is go to the ""Management"" tab of the monitor menu, select ""Audio"", and then turn up the volume control from 50 (default) to 100 and you'll find the monitor speakers are plenty loud. After that, you'll only have to use your PC volume control as normal.",24 people found this helpful

It accepts both HDMI and DisplayPort inputs (and even VGA for old school PCs).  While Windows will select 60Hz refresh rate by default, you can go into Windows' display settings and select 75Hz refresh rate for this monitor.  The 75Hz refresh rate really does help smooth out motion.  You should also go into the monitor's ""Image"" menu setting and set Response Time to Level 3 which provides the best VSYNC performance.  One of the best features that places this monitor above and beyond its price range is the 90-degree rotating screen, height adjustment, and swiveling base.  The stand is rock-solid without any wobble.

I've upped the volume in the button prefs, but I won't be buying another Monitor where they're in the back.  The colors are fantastic.  If I use the DisplayPort, when switching to a game I discovered I have to press the power button on the monitor, let the light go out and press it again to turn on again.  The has returned!  If I exit a game, and go back to Desktop, I usually have to repeat that process.  Using HDMI...zero problems. I have an odd setup, and I wanted to keep the Motherboard Stereo vs GeForce 780's HDMI sound.  But the Monitor kept switching back to HDMI for both every time I turned it off, then later on again.  I then had to go into Monitor settings and change it again.  I, honestly, forgot that my nVIDIA board has HDMI in the video hardware.  Otherwise, this Monitor is doing everything is should and doing it well.  Since nothing is perfect (done, complete, cannot be added to...final).  I would suggest that HP rethinks where the speakers are located.  I'd prefer them to be in the front.  You loose some decibels when they're in the back.  If you're in an Apartment, having the speakers in the back could be less helpful (which I am).  I'm considering doing a cheap fix, ""route"" the sound to the sides...to the front.  Otherwise, I really dig this Monitor. Windows 7 looks / sounds great with it.  Yep, I still adore that version of Windows.  10, horrible GUI, 11...is a little better.  I had to install Realtek's HD Audio driver for all 3 OSes to get the PC Speakers to function.  Once I remembered the nVIDIA has HDMI, I bought a DVI to HDMI..and went that way.  I also disabled the Autio-Switch before doing that.  They have the good fine-tuning controls which makes things sweet. Only problem is...it doesn't save (""remember"") settings.  So that's something they might consider looking into...for oddballs.  HA! I haven't been a fan of HP in many years since their products have become cheap and unreliable for many years.  Before then, they were a GREAT brand.  Since the new printer with the long lasting Ink was released, and my Mother loves it, and since I'm her Tech, I've used it often and it's doing better than 2 other versions of Printers.  So, after checking the reviews here...I thought I'd go ahead and give this a go.  I'll check back later and update after some months.",One person found this helpful

AND, if you have no serial number, there is no way to communicate with HP. Plus, you have no warrantee. Many people find out they have no valid serial number too late.

Very nice picture quality, and there are a lot of adjustments that can be made to make it more to your liking. The stand is awesome, best monitor stand I've ever had. My last two monitors have been Asus, and was planning on getting another Asus, but I seen so many people saying how much they liked this HP, thought I'd give it a try. My last monitor was a Asus vs239h-P 23"" 60mhz., which was a fine monitor and served me well, but was wanting something a little bigger with a 75mhz. refresh rate, and with a Displayport connector. I like the picture quality better on the HP 24mh than the Asus vs239h-P. I don't game much, but I tried a few gams, and it looked good to me, but I'm sure a serious gamer would want something with higher refresh rates. They have a driver you can download for the HP 24mh at HP's website. Highly recommended!update: This is really an amazing monitor. If I get the settings just right and have a great source I can see images with this like I've never seen before. It's that good! My past two Asus monitors were great for reliability, one I used for 4 years, and the one before that I've had for 10 years, and still use it as a backup. Just hope the HP 24mh is this reliable.update: The built in speakers do a good job, not good for listening to music, but I never use a monitors built in speakers.Update 2-8-2023: Still a great monitor, and very glad I purchased it.

She's got a nice ThinkPad and I provided her with a Shure MV51 microphone to give her that big radio voice in Zoom meetings, and a USB Docking station (Plugable brand) which as the capability of dual 4K monitors, so I decided to buy this HP monitor to compliment the 10 year old 22"" ASUS HDMI monitor she had been using. Well, I was totally blown away at how monitor technology has advanced. The resolution on the monitors is the same (1080p) but if you click on the photo, you'll see that the black levels on the new monitor just blow the old one away. This is the reason why Plasma displays dominated high end TV for a while because LCD displays could not deliver the contrast ratios for home theater. Granted, if you're just working on an Excel spreadsheet, reading email or in a Zoom meeting, the difference doesn't matter much. But if you want to take a lunch break and watch a 20 minute episode of your favorite TV show on Hulu, the difference is obvious. I did not give this a rating for gaming, as this wasn't tested and it's not a gaming monitor to begin with. Another nice feature is that it is height adjustable, so no more putting your monitor on a stack of books to raise it a couple of inches. I does have speakers that play through the HDMI input, but they are not as loud as a typical phone. The speakers are good enough for viewing a video or doing a Zoom meeting in a quiet environment, but that's about it. Because the border around the screen is so thin, expect any webcam to intrude a little on the top of the screen. It also uses a standard PC power cord and not a ""wall wart"" power supply. Many new monitors are moving towards this and I don't know if it is a blessing or a curse. The upside is that you can use a standard power cord and not have an external power power supply hanging under your desk. The downside is that if the power supply carps out, you can't replace it - you have it repaired (highly unlikely these days) or replace the entire monitor.

Out of the box, mine had a noticeable bright-spot on right of the display. Annoying, but not intolerable. Additionally, the coating on the display is very good at picking up reflections. I would not recommend using this in a bright, sunny room. Some light is fine, but bright light sources (like the sun or a nearby lamp) will reflect annoyingly well. Finally, this display has fairly poor blacks. My other display (an Acer B243HL, which is too old to even have HDMI) has better blacks, which is disappointing.Overall, a good display for the money. Not ideal for fancy-pants professional work where colors need to be spot on, but no one doing that stuff would buy a $150 monitor.

I found nothing that specifically said that in the instructions, but while trying to figure out why the built-in speakers weren't working, I unplugged the audio cable and immediately the sound worked.

It is all of these, no problem. What you also get is tool-free installation (nice to have even if you have plenty of tools), and cables! I expect a power cord with anything that uses power, but I did not expect an HDMI cable. It did not come with a DisplayPort cable, but I hooked one (of the two I bought) via miniDP, and a full-sized cable would have just gone into the parts pile.  Six-foot HDMI cables are a great item to have laying around.It also came with an 1/8"" stereo patch cable for analog audio. I saw the description about speakers, but didn't intend to use that feature. I didn't even hook up the cable. What surprised me was when the monitor I hooked up via HDMI started playing sound from the laptop. This feature does not seem to be mentioned anywhere in this product description, nor even in the user manual, but this thing does HDMI audio extraction! I haven't yet tried, but I think you could hook up a Chromecast and get the full audio/video experience. That said, there does not seem to be much of an amplifier -- it's not loud, even with the volume cranked all the way up on the PC (there is no on-monitor volume control). In any case, it's a nice bonus. I didn't buy this thing for the speakers, but their presence doesn't bother me. The display portion of the monitor is fairly thin. The speakers do add a bit of girth, but no more than you would have from a similarly-featured (no audio) 24"" monitor from a few years ago. Same goes for weight. I generally use Dell 24"" monitors, and this HP model holds up well against the Dell models that are significantly more expensive (and have not dropped features like VESA mounting and 90 rotating base support).Bottom line: I'm thrilled to get a high quality 24"" 1920x1080 monitor with VESA mounting, 90 rotating base, and both HDMI and DisplayPort, and even giddy about the included HDMI cable and speakers, all for $110.",25 people found this helpful

I then switched back to the old monitor, re-booted, and the same errors occurred and appeared to be permanent.  Possibly, the monitor installed some plug and play software that corrupted the Windows 11 files.  This was the conclusion reached by the Dell techs helping.

So, although she was very nice, she had no idea what she was doing aside from reading a script. They need to add the HDMI issue their script. A note on the site itself might be a good idea as well. Anyway, she set up a return that I later cancelled (they never told UPS that I cancelled so he showed up for a return the next - actually, that was wrong as well since I couldn’t return it till the new one arrived - oh well...)Anyway, after I sat and thought about it for a while, I suspected that the HDMI carrying the audio signal thereby blocking it.

The speakers sound pretty much like any other PC speakers although a tad louder, certainly loud enough for my use. I was able to tweak the sound a bit with the audio manager that came with the Lenovo computer. The point I deducted was for the tech support. I realize this is a new monitor but the people answering the phone should at least understand the technology even if they don’t know the item details.UPDATE 1: The monitor does NOT work well unless I use an HDMI cable, which I am now doing. So, I am back to external speakers. Basically, if I try to use anything other than an HDMI cable, the monitor cuts out (goes dark) frequently, although it does come back on again. BOTTOM LINE: I am not able to use the internal soeakers, perhaps you’ll have better luck...",21 people found this helpful

The picture quality is amazing, and I’m still baffled how big the screen is for the price, it’s like the size of the small television my parents have in their room. I’m streaming Futurama on it through my provider on it as I’m writing this and even my dad dad walked by and even being as nit picky as he is he was impressed. I got it mainly for when school starts up again, and it added more space to my desk and something bigger where I’m not hunched over a laptop staring at a screen and sitting so close as I type (I got a wireless keyboard to go with it) it moves up and down very easily without worry.I gave it four stars for gaming because while I intend to use it for school I do have every intention of playing my PS4 on it, and watching a gamer video on it the quality seems very good. THIS HAS SPEAKERS!!!!!!!! Don’t let other reviews say it doesn’t, it has speakers. I didn’t even have to adjust them when I set it up they just worked immediately.

For some context, I'm a student and my primary use for the screen is to read read read and take lots of notes. I've read a few reviews about issues with the resolution from a mac to this screen, and the surefire way to make sure none of those issues happen is to buy a thunderbolt to hdmi cable - I bought one from amazon basics a couple years ago and it works seamlessly - edge to edge display and full resolution. It's not a 4k monitor or anything but with how big it is and how far back you sit, it's all the same in terms of crisp, clear picture. I don't use my computer for gaming really so I cannot comment on the graphics/resolution for that purpose - but for your basic office or school work - it's perfect.Not sure what a solution would be for newer mac models that have only the usb-c output. Also, this was bought in Feb 2021 and it seems like the latest model comes with built in speakers, has a tilt feature, and vertical sliding to adjust the height. For this price, I think the value is unbeatable. The only downside is that there seems to be no external volume control, but I have my bluetooth headphones in most of the time anyway so it doesn't matter. It also comes with an aux cord to connect to external speakers, and a regular hdmi cable.If you're hesitating on this product, there's a reason it's the #1 seller on computer monitors on amazon!",4 people found this helpful

I had only had it for 26 days. Called Amazon and they said to call HP since it was within the 30 days. HP rep said broken screen was not covered and offered to send me a replacement for the exact price as on Amazon (new) and take 8-10 days to get it to me, PLUS return broken one at my own expense. Thanks, but NO thanks. Called Amazon back on day 30 and told them what HP said and they offered a full refund or replacement with 2-day shipping. They asked me to return the broken one at their cost.  The entire phone conversation took 15 minutes. This is why I am still a Prime customer after almost 20 years. They know how to treat customers.This is a fabulous screen for the price and I could find no others on Amazon in this price range with speakers and 75 hz RR. I did take the replacement, which was here as promised 2 days later and returned the broken one the next day.  Just be careful and only hold the screen on the back and bottom, beveled-edge as the least amount of pressure will crack the screen and that is not covered with Amazon's extra warranty through Assurion nor will HP cover it.",7 people found this helpful

Seemed to resolve the dark area, but in the process, managed to create a much bigger problem. The monitor would just black out entirely after 5-7 minutes regardless of whether I was using it or not. Whatever I had open on that screen would just get stuck there - it wouldn't come back to my laptop or my other external monitor unless I disconnected it. Went through the reset steps 3-4 times and got it back online, but was really frustrated. The fifth time, the monitor blacked out and wouldn't come back on at all except in super brief flashes when I unplugged and replugged the HDMI cable. 30 more minutes on the phone with HP - I have to send it back to them and hopefully will get a replacement in 2-3 weeks (4-6 business days after they receive the original monitor from me).I thought this would be a nice upgrade to get me a full dual monitor set-up alongside a very basic Acer monitor.

I like the input options, and that the monitors have speakers.  I'm no audiophile, so having simple speakers included in the monitors meant I could have one less item on my desk.I put these on the ""Mount it!"" dual VESA mount (https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08BW739D2/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o05_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1), which was super easy.  The monitors came with a very nice, sturdy, flat-base (So you don't totally lose that desk space!!) stand, but I opted for the mount.  The monitors also came with VESA screws already installed, so mounting them just required removal of the screws and reinstallation of the screws with the VESA mount plate.Also, I have been working from home, and had one these hooked up to both my personal computer and my work computer.  Switching inputs was easy using the hard-key buttons hidden on the bottom-right of the monitor body.And as simple as it is, these came with an HDMI an power cable which were 6ft long each, which was nice.  NOTE: The listing says 75hz refresh rate, but that is with DisplayPort cables.  As I write this, these are running at 60hz on the included HDMI cables.  This doesn't matter at all to me, because I don't play games on them, but FYI!I shop around pretty extensively before making purchases, and I feel confident that these are a good value (obviously, since I bought them).  $110 for a brand-name, 1080p, 60/75hz IPS monitor with speakers, VESA mount-reay but comes with a good stand, and has good input options (HDMI, DP, or VGA).

It was very easy to set up and does exactly what I needed it to do. I also like that it has speakers because they do feel louder than the speakers on my laptop.

I saw some reviews that the refresh rate could not be set up to 75 hertz. I have a HDMI port on my Lenovo T480 laptop so I used a HDMI cable, connected it to this monitor, and the refresh rate showed up 75 hertz (see attached photo.)However, if I connect my HDMI cable to my USB C dongle (my dongle has a HDMI connection as well), the refresh rate can only be 60 hertz if connected to a dongle. I have a 2019 MacBook and it doesn't have HDMI connection so I use my USB C dongle to connect this HP monitor to my MacBook. The rate can be 60 hertz (see attached photo.)Therefore, my conclusion would be that you would need to have a direct HDMI connection directly connected your computer with the monitor. If you would use dongles, the refresh rate would be reduced.By the way, the shipping package is very well packed. A HDMI cable and a sound cable are included in the package, so it's very convenient. The Quick Setup Guide is very helpful, very easy to follow to set up the monitor.So far the monitor works great.

No instrructions or reference as to how to make any brightness adjustments or  picture sizing etc.  Amazon stepped up to the plate and providede contact info for HP support and followed up to make sure HP would respond.  I called HP and basically was told they were not interested in providing support for making monirtor adjustments.  The rep I talked to gave me a number to call in HP that would help for a fee. The tech did send a complete users guide via email. Why that was not at least for key adjustments wasn't included with the monitor is beyond me.  This monitor is now in operastion and working fine. It replaced an veey old HP monitor that was very old , but had all the appropriate iinstructions/tips. Hard to believe that HP saved enough money , by not putting some o simple how to start and set up basuic operation instructions in the  units packaging.  I sent HP a long note re my disappointment/concerns.  No response.Bottom line Amazon did all the right things re customer support. HP after my  spending too much time talking to ""HP support"" provided a detailed user guide, very disappointing support and  not even the courtesy of a note acknowledging my issues.",

It's an LCD.,"Reviewed in the United States on January 6, 2022",Style: Monitor,True,"The picture quality is quite nice. A decent base gaming monitor. The screen has no bevels and breaks easily. Good midling grade monitor with FHD. Enjoyed monitor for approximately a year.This is an LCD monitor. I honestly didn't think that businesses bothered to make LCD monitors anymore since they're so dated, costly, and environmentally unfriendly. Unfortunately it's not stated anywhere in the description that it's an LCD monitor or I honestly wouldn't have purchased it. My purchase ended up having deadly consequences.My cat, Bagheera, suddenly decided he really liked my monitor (after a year of using it) and bit the corner cracking the screen. A couple days later he became very ill and stopped eating. He lost 25% of his body mass. I never suspected the screen.I brought him to the vet and had tests run. The vet said that he developed jaundice from rapidly losing weight. She said the tests showed no underlying illness. She questioned if he had come into contact with any poisonous materials. Not knowing my monitor was LCD and knowing Bagheera lived in a highly controlled environment, I said no. She said the only other likely cause would be a congenital defect. Bagheera went downhill quickly and needed to be put to sleep.My friend ended up questioning if biting the screen  hurt him. It then dawned on me that my monitor could possibly be an LCD. I knew the liquid layer of LCDs can contain around 30 toxic chemicals (including mercury). Turns out the monitor was an LCD. It was the only object in his limited environment that contained toxic substances. Which he also had contact with prior to illness. With LCDs being known to cause animal deaths and congenital defects more rare. I'm inclined to believe it was the monitor that harmed Bagheera.In the end,  it was a freak accident. No one's fault,except possibly my own. But I don't recommend pet owners risk it. You could be out a monitor, $500, and a loved companion.",14 people found this helpful

I bought this because I needed a monitor for a 2-month stint working away from my regular ""office"", and I didn't want to spend much money for a short term need. I'm very impressed with how far my money stretched with this product.I'm mostly familiar with working with Dell Ultrasharp monitors, which are a higher-end product. A dell ultrasharp of the same size/resolution costs twice as much as this. For half the price, I would judge this HP monitor to have 90-95% as good a screen quality. It's clear, easy to look at, and not reflective at all. The colors are bright and there don't appear to be obvious limits to color gamut. Some cheap displays I've used have whacky blues/greens/yellows, but this monitor doesn't have any such problems.The build and stand feel like great quality, with sturdy mechanisms to assemble and move the screen around. If I had to pick one flaw, it would be that the stand seems to transmit a few vibrations from the table, resulting in the screen shaking when I'm typing too vigorously. This certainly won't affect my work, but for those who wish to furiously bash a keyboard while gaming, you might want a slightly more sturdy product.Ultimately, I've used similarly-priced displays with MUCH worse screens than this. So if you want quality without spending a lot, this is a great choice.",One person found this helpful

I really like that it's wide panoramic view, the sleek build, as I have a small desk space and I work with large Excel spreadsheet.The setup was fast and easy, you can customize the tilt, height, direction (landscape/portrait) and mount (but I still use the support it came with).I am no expert in display quality, I don't play games and rarely watch movies, the resolution from my point of view (if it matters) is outstanding. My desk is near a window, but I never had issues with glare.The speakers are decent, but I still prefer to rely on the audio from my laptop. The only small complaint is that Skype automatically connects to them instead of my headset, so I always had to make sure I have the proper audio device connected during meetings. But they are still a good add-on to have.The monitor has tons of features to play with and setup the video and audio, including blue light adjustment. I highly encourage people to actually read the manual to get most out of it.",

I have one of those adjustable desk tops so I waned an adjustable-height display to get the display to the right height.  I don't play games at all and am not a serious photographer so I don't really care about good performance or color accuracy.The display came sooner than promised and I was impressed with the no-tool setup.  Rotating it to the portrait mode requires you to tilt the screen first.I have my work computer on the VGA port and my new home computer on the HDMI port.  The sound is loud enough from both and I did not have to make any adjustments / selections to make it happen.  However, when the analog audio cable is plugged into my work computer, there is the occasional hissing/static sound (even when I am not playing any sound on the computer).  It is probably some kind of electric interference?  I tried repositioning the cable and that did not help.I am definitely more productive at work now given the larger screen.  The 24 inch size is perfect since it still shows most of my notebook computer screen (my adjustable table top is space-limited).",

It is a good looking monitor with very thin bezels on the top and sides.  The bottom has a bigger bezel with the HP logo and power light.  It is a very stark and pleasant difference compared to my older Dell monitor that has a thick bezel on all sides.The picture quality is good but not super.  I can compare it directly with my Dell monitor that sits right next to it.  I see the difference in sharpness as I drag any app from one screen to the other.  The Dell monitor is sharp and precise while the HP seems a bit fuzzier.  This is especially apparent at higher resolution with small text.  For anything else, it really is a good monitor (especially for the price).  Pictures look good and watching videos is also a good experience.The brightness is excellent does not get washed out, even with sunlight coming in the window.  The range between pure white and black is also very good.  Overall a good monitor for general usage and for business apps.  I don't play many games, so I can't comment on the response time of the monitor.",

The stand clicks together easily and is secured with one screw that has a wing thing so you don't need any tools to put it together.  Takes about 1-2 minutes.  Plug-and-play baby.

I can't give a comprehensive review, as I just installed it.  I do have one criticism, not of the monitor itself, but of the information in the description.  I wanted the largest screen that would fit in my somewhat limited space and the product information indicated that it was close to 19"" tall.  That was the very limit of my space.  However, it is an adjustable height and can be reduced to as low as 15"" from the base.  So, had I known that, I would have probably purchased a larger monitor.  The actual graphic shows a measurement of 18.28 "" but the line showing this vertical size is only along the edge of the monitor, implying the screen itself is 18.28"".  That is very misleading.  The advertisement does say it is adjustable in height, but does not give any dimensions.  Purchasing an item without being able to see it in person is difficult and often leads to returns and dissatisfaction. I think this information would be very valuable to include in future ads.",

I get why ports are positioned this way but I would hope in today's modern era they'd make it easier to insert a cable. Some may not like the adjustable height mechanism to raise/lower the display.

I bought 2 of these monitors, and sadly 1 of them had this issue as you can see in my photo.My previous monitors were old ones that me & my mom stole from her office, and they still worked perfectly after 5yrs. Disappointing that these brand new screens have problems right out of the box. I will admit though, other than the lighting issue, they have good brightness and color. After going through reddit threads, I've concluded it's not really an HP issue, but rather the fact these are just cheap monitors that probably have bad quality control.Anyways, if you grab one of these, there's a chance you'll end up with a monitor that's just fine. But of course I'm not taking my chances again, and at the time of writing this, I've already bought two Dell S2421HSX's as replacements. Hopefully those one's won't have a lighting issue, but I'd be lying if I said that wouldn't be hilarious.",4 people found this helpful

The viewing space is amazing with the bezel so thin on the top and sides you wonder how it manages to hold the monitor in, and on the bottom with barely enough room for the HP logo. The controls are extremely intuitive, which was a new experience for me with monitors. You push a button, and arrows pop up on the screen indicating which button you need to push next to get what you want.I've only had this monitor for a few days now, and who knows... maybe it will blow up next week.

After one month of using the monitor started to dim out every few seconds even though I was actively in it's screen.  I ordered a replacement immediately and the vendor was quick to send me the replacement. meanwhile I suspect it wasn't the monitor but rather the HDMI to USB-C connector I purchased together with this monitor is at fault.  I hence ordered the replacement of the connector as well.  Once the replacements arrived, I first replace the HDMI to USB-C connector for testing. Sure enough, it was the connector being defected since the old monitor's dimming out behavior stopped completely.

Unfortunately, within the first 90 days (but after 30 days), I attempted to adjust the tilt for better ergonomics and the screen cracked. I used very little pressure in moving the screen, but the frame is not built with enough durability to prevent the screen from cracking.Speaking with customer service was a horrendous 45 minute waste of time. I was informed that I would have to pay for the repair as it was customer inflicted and the 1-year warranty does not cover the hardware. When I asked what the charge would be, I was asked to provide my email (again), phone number (again), address, the product number, and the serial number (again), before they could tell me what the charge would entail. All of that to be told ""I'm only hardware support, I don't know about charges"". After expressing my extreme frustration, I was informed that there would be no charge. Then, 3 chat messages later, was told that if there is a charge I would be contacted by the repair department. Either there is a charge or there isn't a charge; and why, are they not able to tell me what the charge is going to be?So now, I'm being sent a box to package my faulty product and send it to them for repair/replacement with no knowledge of if they plan to charge me or not for the repair/replacement. As I use my monitor for online business, this seriously hinders my ability to work for an undetermined amount of time. It is beyond my capable understanding how a company can ask a customer to blindly send them a product and potentially commit to undisclosed charges. What's more is that I cannot make an educated decision as to if I need to purchase another monitor or wait for this one to be repaired/replaced because they refuse to provide me with necessary information, further delaying my ability to work efficiently.Until today, I would have swore by HP products and have always sought them out first because I've been happy with their product line. It is unfortunate that I will now seek other brands due to such a low quality of customer support when things don't go as planned. As a small business owner and online company, it is critical that I can rely on a company to have good customer support. Products break and things happen, I cannot risk poor customer service delaying my business productivity.",30 people found this helpful

I had no problem running it at 75hz. I bought this mainly for running the new Microsoft flight simulator. It works well for that thought I do notice a little bit of backlight bleed in the corners in dark night flying.  The stand is bit more bulkier than it should be but it does make it feel sturdy. Speakers are only ok but better than nothing. Sounds better against a wall because they are backfiring. You're better off getting some bluetooth speakers. I didn't see any other monitors at this price point with speakers so that's a plus. One star off for the backlight bleed.,

Picture quality on the one we received is just OK if you can look past the light bleed around most of the edges and corners. I could probably live with that because of the price but there are other problems.  The setup/menu software for adjusting the monitor is sparse and some of the features keep changing on their own, for example, the sound setup/menu for the built-in speakers.  Because I am using an HDMI cable for the picture and a line-in cable from an external sound source for the sound the monitor wants to use the HDMI cable as a source for the sound to the speakers so it resets itself every time the computer is shutdown or rebooted.  If I don't go into the menu setup of the monitor each time the drivers are updated or the system is shutdown or rebooted we don't have any sound and we need to change the setup back to using the line-in cable as the source, then it works fine, until the next time (even the computer going into sleep mode causes this problem).Went to HP,s support site only to find one set of drivers and manuals designed to work over a wide array of their monitors and no firmware updates to fix this problem (or anything else for that matter) and they want to blame everything and everybody else as a source for the problem instead of the problematic software that they refuse to acknowledge is the problem.

It arrived quickly and undamaged. And for 2-1/2 months it was a good purchase.A few days ago I started noticing that when I switched applications a ""ghost"" would remain on the screen, visible, behind/below the currently running application. (No, my monitor does not stay turned on to a static screen for hours on end.)Today the problem was so bad I contacted Amazon product support. They were as helpful as they could be, including the CS agent holding for 27 minutes for HP Support to answer the phone..........And then the nightmare began.The first person at HP went through a few troubleshooting steps and said he thought the problem may be the graphics card drivers or the card itself. But, because my desktop is a Lenovo he had to transfer me to an HP agent who could help with a non-HP computer.That person did a few trouble shooting steps (after trying to tell me how to hook up my new printer after I explained the monitor issue) and said that the computer was not the problem, it was the monitor and needed to be resolved as an ""in-warranty"" issue and transferred me to the HP warranty department for resolution.This new agent, after telling me I could ""reset"" the monitor by holding the power key for 15 seconds then said that the problem was not a warranty issue and said she was going to transfer me back to the department that had sent me to her. At which point, after almost 90 minutes on the phone with HP and almost 30 before that with Amazon, I lost my feces.So, tomorrow I am going to file a warranty complaint through my credit card company, file a lack of customer service and common sense complaint with HP and start looking for a new monitor - NOT HP!Until this issue I would have given this monitor a 4 or 5 star rating. Not now, it is only a 1 star, a monitor should not start failing in less than 3 months. The customer service experience is a negative 5.",54 people found this helpful

One monitor gets up to 60hz and the other gets up to 75hz. This is already slow as heck and the difference between the monitor speeds contributed I’m sure. I had to keep them both at 60hz because having them at different speeds caused some serious “stuttering” and “lagging” and other typing, clicking, other processes. The stuttering and lagging was always there but when the speeds were set different, it was even worse.  I was dealing with all that cause I’m cheap but today, while working, the 75hz monitor just died on me out of nowhere. It hasn’t even been a year since my purchase. I tried so many different connectivity solutions and nothing worked. The monitor just wouldn’t pick up the signal from the HDMI cable (3 different ones!). I’m so incredibly frustrated and annoyed, especially considering the price has gone up by $65 since I bought this monitor. This monitor is cheap and unreliable.

Until a week ago, they were brilliant. Now one of them has started to black out. At first it was just a quick1-2 second black out 3-4 times a day. But today , the faulty monitor has been blacking out every few seconds. Super annoying and stressful on the eyes. I've had to shut it down. Drivers are all up to date, power cord connections are solid! Shame on you HP for such a drop in performance in just two years! Changing my review from 5 stars to 2....Oct'20 : I work in user experience and improving a customer's 'out of the box' experience. This monitor and its packaging were truly a user's delight. It took me exactly 90 seconds to get this baby up and running. The user guide was so easy to follow. The monitor itself is lightweight but packs in an excellent display. The speakers are such a joy. I can actually handle work calls without a headset. The low light display setting at night is beautiful. My only issue is that I could raise the monitors to position them above my line of sight (ideal for minimal neck/eye strain) but thankfully, my standing desk comes in handy for this purpose. If you are ever remotely considering this monitor, think no more. Just get it.",

The screen is not very bright or very sharp. Then the screen died the SECOND I was out of the return window. Contacted Amazon, no help. Contacted HP - the warranty only covers REPAIR not REPLACEMENT. It took me 2 hours to get an HP tech support rep on the line. They made me walk through a bunch of useless time wasting steps about updating the graphics card, and wouldn't listen to me when I kept explaining that it was a HARDWARE issue with the LCD panel. Then they wanted to do a live chat so they could screenshot the damage themselves to open a claim. Now they want to snail mail me a box, have me drop the monitor off at UPS, and wait for it to be repaired and returned. So, now it's taken me a ton of time to get this claim opened, I have to give them my monitor to repair and be without a monitor for the time it takes to get it repaired, and they're going to return the same damaged, defective product back to me. They refused to give me ANY TIME FRAME for repairs. They also hassled me and insinuated that this was my fault somehow, even though it's been connected to a VERSA mount the entire time and never touched. TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE. CHEAP MONITOR.

I bought two of them back in November 2020 around the holidays. After a about a month of daily use for work, I started to notice a slight discoloration in the image of one monitor. The screen started to have a reddish hue to it despite having adjusted both monitors to have the same image/color settings. I tried adjusting the colors but the reddish/pinkish hue was still discrete I left. I had high hopes for this monitor, being an HP product and all, and really wanted to like it. Although the other monitor was ok, I’ve decided to return both (after reading the other reviews posted after I bought these) since I don’t want to wait for the other monitor to show signs of discoloration just after return period expires on January 31, 2021. No wonder the price was relatively cheap. I hope you will not have the same experience that I’ve had. I will update this review once I turn them both on when I return to work on Monday and show a picture of what I’m talking about.Update: 1/4/21: uploaded a picture of the reddish/pinkish hue on the screen on the left",One person found this helpful

HP's technical assistance chat person quickly told me that I had to call a different technical support line for this problem and that there would be a nominal fee for the service. (What!?). I called anyway but got bored waiting and explored Amazon's support (Tokyo rocks!) Return and refund were processed right away and I ordered Dell monitors instead.",9 people found this helpful

It worked fine, until today, when it didn't. Yesterday it was working fine. Today I turned it on, and first there was one horizontal, purple ""band"" going across the screen. Within minutes, there were several purple, green, and dotted lines going horizontally on the screen, and three lines going vertically down the screen, along with an odd shaped splotch of purple and black. There are no cracks, it wasn't dropped, product was handled with the utmost care. Whenever I'd use it, I would carefully return it to the manufacturer's box, with the styrofoam included, to keep it protected. Called Amazon, who transferred me to HP tech support. Now they say they're going to send me a box and shipping label. If the problem is internal and because of faulty hardware, they are supposed to send me a new monitor. If it is because of ""damage,"" then they'll ""contact me."" I'm not holding my breath that this will work out smoothly. At almost $200, I expect a product to work longer than 3 months. With runaway inflation, I don't have the resources or patience to keep replacing practically brand new monitors.",4 people found this helpful

I've tried to take pictures of them,  but they only show up on images with a blue tint to them, and my camera won't capture the lines, they blend into the rest of the image.I'm going to keep the monitor, as the price almost makes it more hassle to get it packed up and shipped back for a refund.

I asked if they could send out a replacement immediately if I put a credit card on file so I would not have to be without a monitor for an extended period and they said they could not do that.  OK. I will just have to live without for the 8-10 days they quoted.It has now been 13 days since they started the return process and it is still showing a status of ""Preparing shipping materials""  I contacted HP support after 10 days and they said they would send a note to the team responsible to get it moving along and they would keep me updated on progress.

After going through this problem every day for a couple of weeks, multiple times a day, my computer has started to have great difficulty rebooting. I believe it's being damaged by all the hard reboots. And HP's website says there are only two possible solutions to this problem: Change sleep/hibernate settings to ""never"", and if that doesn't work (which it didn't in my case!), HP says just don't use the software (or app) that causes the error message! Problem is, it's now happened in eight different programs/apps... way too many to simply stop using them all!!! This monitor is simply garbage!!!

The only way I can get audio to the speakers is via HDMI. Except there's no volume controls on the monitor, and most systems (including macs, gaming consoles, etc) don't allow you to adjust volume before outputting, so there's no way to adjust system volume using HDMI for audio.It came with a male-to-male 3.5mm audio cable, the type you'd expect to use to connect speakers to your computer. But in plugging the cable into the monitor and the computer, I don't get any sound. The only way I've found to get sound is to switch the audio output on my computer back from headphones to hdmi. So I don't know if the audio jack is a broken input, or if it's actually an output that allows your audio from the hdmi to go to external speakers. The fact that the audio port is completely unmarked doesn't help, either.As for the display itself, it's OK I guess. The quality isn't as good as the iMac that it replaced, despite the fact that my iMac was over 8 years old. The brightness and colors are passable, but it seems noticeably less sharp, even though this monitor and my old iMac both have a resolution of 1080p.",10 people found this helpful

That was 3 weeks ago. No box has arrived.Last week I gave up and bought a new monitor. Now I'll try to get HP to refund me.So on the one hand, the monitor is probably fine - I am sure a small percentage of every brand monitor randomly breaks. But the time it took to get actual help from HP - navigating their very awkward phone system and chat system and then pushing them to do the right thing, and then them ignoring me. Not cool.I don't like it when people say blanket statements like, 'NEVER buy from (insert company) again.'

Nightmare with HP support started in late May, when I first reported the issue. Poor communication from HP led me to understand they will first ship the replacement and then I can ship the problematic monitor. A month of calls later HP has my monitor, repairs it and sends it to a wrong address. Now it can't speak internally to the service center to provide me updates. I call or chat with the offshore team, who say they are escalating but no resolution. So frustrated at the really horrible support. Support site says monitor exchanged and gives me no way to contact for help - no chat or customer support number provided. Maybe we got a lemon, since it's got a lot of features at a good price!The real deal for 24"" monitor - even without a BF sale.

However as time went on...it happened more often. I thought it was user error so I bought another cord (matter of fact 2) and none of them work. I called to get support and its been the worst experience ever. I am out of the 30 day warranty so I had to call HP. They ran me around and now I have to send it back for them to review but said they might not be able to fix it because I would have to pay $50 to start up a plan to have support. For a $150 monitor.... I think not! It should have lasted. I am sending it off today after a long process of getting shipping label, so we will see.

I know this is a first world problem but the fact that I've been shipped 2 faulty products back to back is ridiculous. Companies should not be allowed to sell garbage like this. I will not be purchasing any other HP products and I suggest that you don't either.Origional: This monitor arrived with a crack on the screen. There is also flecks of ripped plastic on the edges of the monitor which makes me think that this was a repackaged, used monitor. There is typically a plastic sheet that peals off the front of the monitor and this was was already pulled off. This is pretty disappointing to think that HP is selling used/damaged products.I have ordered a replacement. Until that arrives and works as intended I'm not happy with the purchase and expect more from HP.1 star until I receive the new product I paid for.",2 people found this helpful

There's a reason this monitor is CHEAP!,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on November 4, 2020",Style: Monitor,True,"I was on the fence about buying this monitor but ended up doing so because of the hp brand name. Within two hours of use the screen has LED-backlighting burned into it. This is where the edges of the screen become burnt and discolored from poorly manufactured led lighting. Also, the picture is absurdly dark. I also suspect this to be the faulty LEDs. I went in to check the brightness and contrast setting only to find that both settings were already set near the max by factory default!  It's such a shame that amazon suggested this to me and that hp would put their name on something that's clearly defective. Don't be fooled by the nice trailers and good reviews like I was, just pay the extra $50 and get the monitor you actually want. It really is sad how far the quality standard has fallen. Well, I hope this helps others avoid this monitor like the plague.",12 people found this helpful

I tried several cables and even another computer, but the dead pixel look never let up. I installed the drivers for the monitor and updated my graphics drivers as well, with no success.After this I got a replacement monitor. The replacement monitor was worse because it showed up in packaging that had clearly been put back together after having been opened and used, and the screen had fingerprints and smudges on it. The second monitor also had the same pixel issues, except that it was also having an issue where the screen turns black every 30 seconds or so.

After two weeks with no box I called them back and they said they were out of stock and it would be “another week” (we’ll see).

I noticed first an ugly yellow colored light bleed to the bottom left of the screen (as seen in attached photos).This deeply upset me because by the look of it, it may very well spread and become more problematic.If that wasn't enough, upon further inspection the right hand side of the monitor also has a light bleed that's less intense and white colored.Now I find it very distracting anytime I work with a dark picture or screen.This is really upsetting as I haven't even had this device two months and it received in perfect condition after shipping, which leads me to think this is a product defect.If this didn't happen this review would be a solid 4.",

So glad i did, it does not take up as much desk space as i thought it would. YES, it definitely has speakers and regardless what reviews say, they sound fine (I didn't even need to turn up in settings). Love the adjustable height and also that it will turn vertical if needed.

I am reviewing this from a budget gaming / everyday use standpoint.I've been impressed with this monitor for what I paid for it, so far. I use this as my main monitor right now due to budget concerns. I bought two, so I can use dual monitors in the future, or as a backup. I'm reviewing this product as a budget gamer, not as someone who needs perfect color or accuracy.The monitor has very low input lag (this has nothing to do with advertised response time; read up on input lag if you don't know) which is great! I previously used the ASUS vh236h, which was a monitor that was used for years in professional fighting game events. This feels the same or better to me, though I do not have professional testing tools available. It rated ~10ms on displayninja's review.The monitor runs at 60hz or 75hz. You can set it up in your graphics card control panel. I experience one bug where when I set the scaling on my nVidia card and each time I choose 60hz, it defaults back to 75. This is only for the scaling options - the native resolution of 1920x1080 runs at either.  Also, the game Spelunky locks at 50 frames per second, regardless of the setting in my graphics control panel. This IS a known issue with Spelunky that I hadn't experienced on my old monitor. I can fix it by keeping VLC open in the background while the game is on. I wanted to mention this just to provide as much detail as possible about my experience.I use the monitor in portrait mode for pinball, and it's nice having the IPS screen so it is viewable from either angle, if I am slightly to the left or right (playing with two people for example). There are no issues tracking the ball, or any extreme ghosting using the default settings. It's even easier tracking the ball at 75hz, but this can screw up some physics in certain pinball games.I also play a lot of oldschool Doom  - online and off. It's a very fast paced game, and monitor performs well for what it is.As far as inputs, I use the Display Port input, and had to purchase a cable. Be aware that if you have an older computer / graphics card, and choose to use the VGA input, that can add some slight input lag converting the analog signal to digital. I also have my Nintendo Switch hooked up to the HDMI port. I like how the monitor switches inputs automatically depending on signal, so I can hit Windows Key + L (locking computer, which causes monitor to go to sleep after a minute), then turn on the switch and it will change inputs for me after a couple minutes.Some reviews have mentioned that the cables come loose. So far, mine are tight, but I can see the power cable loosening after many rotations into portrait mode. Will update review if I experience this.The speakers are actually not terrible. They aren't too tinny or grating on my ears like my past monitor. I use dedicated speakers for PC, but at the moment am happy with the onboard speakers for the Switch. There doesn't seem to be a quick shortcut button for volume, however. So I have to go into the menu to adjust. I just keep it at 10, and disable sound on my PC's Display Port connection so I don't have to worry about it.Speaking of menus, I find this one easy to use and functional. When you hit a button under the monitor, a shortcut menu will appear onscreen right above the buttons, so you know which one to hit without memorizing them. The menu is speedy and responsive. Keep in mind I've been using the ASUS vh236 for the past many years, so compared to that, this is amazing. I do not have much else to compare it too, however.A final note - one of my monitors had a small bit of plastic that wasn't molded correctly, and protrudes upwards from the bottom bezel. It does not reach the viewable area of the screen though, and is unnoticeable unless I'm looking for it.TLDR:-great for the budget gamer who doesn't mind 60/75 hz vs 120+-low input lag-rotates into portrait mode-lightweight, easy to rotate and tilt (tilts backward, and very slightly forward)-speakers are passable-thin upper and side bezels (good for multi-monitor setup)-easy to use menu-no volume shortcut, have to navigate menuIf you are on a budget, or just need another monitor, and can get this <=$120, it's an excellent deal.",One person found this helpful

Now that I have my hands on it I can confidently say that they do not know what they are talking about. The display runs at 60hz by default, but can be set at 75hz in the display adapter settings (not Windows settings, the actual adapter settings). The speaker works fine, and sounds decent if you keep your expectations reasonable. To clarify I have it connected with DisplayPort, so I cannot vouch for HDMI but would expect the experience to be the same. I got this to use as a second screen in portrait orientation, and you can't beat it for the price. I needed something that was cheap to use for displaying digital textbooks, and for that purpose I really don't have any complaints.Pros: 75hz, bright, colors look good, included stand swivels (clockwise only), DisplayPort and HDMI inputs, built in speaker is a nice touch and doesn't sound too bad, arrived within three days w/o prime.Cons: The silver bezel looks a bit odd when in portrait (who cares), 5ms response time acceptable but not ideal for gaming.You could game on this, but might want to spend a little more on something with a lower response time.

The bezels are almost non-existent. I kind of wish that the bezel on the bottom was black because it would blend so well. Also, the monitor is easy to setup as it doesn't require you to have any special tools. One problem that I am facing is that the power cable is very loose on the back where it connects to the monitor and the monitor turns off if I move the power cable around.

That's because you need to change the sound output settings on your computer:- Mac OS: Apple icon --> System Preferences --> Sound --> Output --> select HP 24mh- Windows: In the monitor menu, go to Management --> Audio --> check PC Analog Audio (based on another review)To change audio volume:1. Press any of the buttons next to the start button of the monitor twice.2. Use the arrows and icons to navigate the menu to Management --> Audio --> Volume3. You can also change volume settings on most video/audio playing apps.Remember that if you computer doesn't have an HDMI port, you will need to buy a separate adapter! For Mac laptops:1. Identify the model of your Mac2. Check what port it has by going to this website: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT2017363. Buy an adapter that transmit from your port to HDMI (not the other way around). Check the product description to see if the adapter is compatible with your laptop.

My computer desk is the 'usual' accepted height and even with a 5"" keyboard shelf the old inexpensive monitor was still too low and aggravating my cervical pinched nerve.This extended to its max height along with the shelf positions it perfectly to keep my neck and head tilted up as opposed to down aggravating the forward arched position so many suffer from.  Along with physical therapy, this monitor is relieving my neck pain.At the price point it has a lot to offer.  Love the screen size and it has a decent built in sound.  No need for additional speakers which is a major space saver.  It tilts, you can raise it up and down, can be justed in landscape or portrait positions.  It's everything a senior needs.",

I wish, though, that new hardware came with a real manual as opposed to a quick start page of instructions. I made the mistake of attaching both a speaker cable and HDMI, and was puzzled as to why the speakers weren't working. I had to contact HP support and found them less than helpful. The technician that I contacted insisted that this monitor doesn't even have speakers! Also, as another reviewer pointed out, you have to go into the settings of the monitor to boost the volume up to 100% or it will be hard to get adequate volume from the speakers. All in all, however, I'm very happy with this monitor.",

For the price, it does the job quite well, but cannot compare with the clarity, etc. that one finds on laptop monitors. The colors seems reasonably accurate and the brightness (250 nits) is adequate but usually has to be kept at the maximum level. This is certainly not a gaming monitor.If you buy this monitor to use it with a desktop PC for office work, it will do the job but you could probably do better if you spend a bit more. Letters, for example, are not all that crisp on the screen and while easily readable, you might find them a bit thin/dull and not having enough brightness.The features of the monitor are basic. If you wish to place a webcam on top of it, you would need one with a less bulky clamp. I used the following: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B086GQSKK3/ and it fit perfectly, the clamp staying just above the screen area.Being able to adjust easily the monitor height is a plus and installation was easy.

I wanted a reasonably large monitor but not so large that I couldn't remove it from the table for weekends. Nevertheless, i wanted the ability to rotate the screen to fit a letter on it comfortably. i had also wanted lightweight.The HP  has a brilliant stand, & is v sturdy.  it allows sliding the monitor up & down, at an angle, & yes it does allow full rotation. I read in questions varying answers. The trick to rotation is that one has to slide the monitor as far up from the base as possible, then angle it upwards, at which point it will then  will clear the bottom to allow rotation; otherwise it will not.i wanted a screen that prevents eye fatigue. ASUS advertises this in its headline description. HP has the ability  in its menu to select low blue light, which is the main way to reduce eye fatigue.  The menu system is v easy to use & access.  It also has HP enhance + which I highly recommend in other situations.  The versatility of positioning of the monitor makes for much less stress on eyes too.The screen with stand is not the  lightest at 10 pounds for a 24 inch but  not terrible.  This includes the  magnificent stand which  is v easy to detach unlike many others. Its a simple push to disengage, & pull at the back. This allows for easy storage, in my case over weekends. Keep the packing material to protect the screen. Id say that added at least a few pounds, & was completely worth it.  The monitor also  incorporates the brick many monitors leave with the cable. I don't like all those power cables with bricks, so i welcome the choice. again this adds a pound but avoids clumsiness and unsightly wiring.resolution is reasonable on par with most other basic monitors. the refresh rate apparently can run up to 75hz but i haven't tested this with my Chromebook. the usb-c displayport works perfectly .For the price this is excellent value. a premium build monitor for a basic price.",One person found this helpful

Screen clarity is spectacular. A lot of reviewers have complained about the overall sound quality, but it's actually very good. So, please do not assume that you are purchasing a product with poor audio. The audio is solid. That said, you will have to manually adjust the audio as some reviewers have stated. The audio is the one feature that will definitely not be perfect right out of the box. Adjust via the monitor by going into the settings - select Management - Audio - Volume. Increase the volume to 100. Then, if you have an HP laptop -- System -- Sounds -- All Sound Devices -- Select HP 24 mh. Adjust the monitor volume as needed. If your laptop is a different brand be sure to adjust the audio for the actual monitor. I will likely purchase a second monitor in the future. This one so far has actually exceeded my expectations. This particular monitor is ideal for anything from working on Excel spreadsheets to watching a movie on Amazon Prime (with or without headphones).",

The picture is sharp and clear and the colors are excellent. The controls are easy to use and allow you to adjust the monitor to whatever it takes to meet your needs. Over the years I've owned many monitors with built in speakers and usually they sound like crap, tinny with no low end, but this one really shines. Sound quality is excellent and it is very loud, if you want it to be. I think HP is using television technology for the sound. Last of all, the price was a bargain.
