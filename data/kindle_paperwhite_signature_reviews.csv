"Kindle Paperwhite Signature Edition (32 GB) – With a 6.8"" display, wireless charging, and auto-adjusting front light – Without Lockscreen Ads – Black",4.0,A step up from the 8GB version if you must use your Kindle for audio.,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on November 14, 2021",Color: Black | Option: Without Kindle Unlimited,True,"This is a copy of my main review in the 8GB device category appended with differences for this 32GB version. 4 stars unless you don't need the space, and then it becomes redundant and too expensive.The 32GB version is in my opinion a bit overboard for most people, but if you have money to spend, it is probably the version you should get, especially if you enjoy audio books. The extra memory to me amounts to useless space, but I personally do not use audiobooks or books with larger file sizes.I have a fairly large library, and that still was working out alright on my 7th gen with 4GB or less. For certain users, this will be the proper device to get. For others, they should look at the 8GB model, or perhaps using your phone for audio. I highly recommend the ""essentials"" bundles to save money.A normal user could have 2000-3000 normal books on their device with the 8GB. Seeing as a ton of my books are Delphi collections, this amounts to even more books relative to the average sizing around 2-4MB or so. Fact is, most people simply don't need this space, and it is useless for most by the time they upgrade due to batteries becoming less efficient. Audiobooks tend to take a lot more space, and it might be for this user that the 32GB is most appropriate.You can hold 20-40 audiobooks on an 8GB device, so for people that must have audiobooks on a Kindle, as opposed to their smartphone with better speakers and more memory, then maybe this is for you. But I would prefer audio on a device of my choosing that had better options for sound.The wireless charging is basically not a deal changer for me. I highly recommend having wireless off on the Kindle to save battery. Charging it works much the same as any device, but cords work fine for me as well, especially with the updated USB-C design. The auto-light is awkward mostly, and I have never used it on any device with one. For the extra money, I only find this device useful for people that absolutely need audio for their Paperwhite device.In full I simply will not use the extra space, and the other features are useless. Others may find them more appropriate. I don't see the point in paying Amazon more money. The lifeline of this device depends on the battery, and by the time I need 32GB, if that ever happens, I will be getting a new device. Not bad, but too expensive, as I mostly use physical books anyway.Overall Review for the Paperwhite 2021 (Four Stars):Summary:+ Best screen of any Paperwhite or Kindle released to date+ Best response time of any Paperwhite or Kindle+ UI improvements+ Weight and feel are exceptional- Screen has uneven area with color temp on high brightness- Expensive- Previous Kindles still do things in much the same wayComing from the 7th gen Kindle, this is a gigantic improvement on all fronts. The Paperwhite 2021 also handily beats the pulp out of the Paperwhite 2018 version due to its new LED array, and for my money it's a better choice than the Oasis 3 as well due to ergonomics. Add in some extra screen real estate compared to previous Paperwhites, a much nicer bezel, a few more options for the UI, and what we have is an extremely polished device for reading digital books. It's never going to make me switch totally from physical, but I will definitely be using this to read a lot more than my previous Kindle.The screen here is nearly perfect, and it will be the main factor attracting those coming from the previous 2018 model. If things were cheaper, this would be an essential upgrade for most people. I would not do without it if given the choice. Feel free to browse all the negative reviews from 2018. They were all right. But now it seems Amazon has finally finished their beta device. The screen itself is more matte than shiny, easy to wipe off, clear but not distracting, and fully able to replicate a physical book with its expanded dimensions. The Oasis 3 for instance irritates me with its form factor. The Paperwhite 2018 has an ugly bezel as well. This is exactly what I wanted out of an E-Reader.The Paperwhite 2021 is lit by 17 LEDs compared to 5 LEDs in the 2018 model, which leads to vastly superior balance. There are 24 gradations for both brightness and warmth, from off to mango warm, and they make a tangible and visible difference in proper aesthetics related to actual physical books. The color options are great, but after some use there still seems to be a portion equating to about the bottom half of the screen on mine that is a very slightly greener hue as opposed to a warmer hue on top. Very hard to pick up for some people, but it's worth noting for users that want to use this on high brightness. I usually only use around 6-12 brightness to get proper coloring, and it's not really noticeable in lit rooms with these settings. I usually use the lovely dark mode at night, so in the end I'll say this issue really doesn't affect me much.Make no mistake, though, the 2018 Paperwhite had an awful screen, with a horrendous LED array, and this one is a massive upgrade. This 2021 version still  has a fully stable lighting array that doesn't evoke a poor production run or haste in design, yet it's not perfect either. Blacks could definitely be deeper with an OLED screen or something of the sort. Dark Mode still looks good, but on higher brightness it appears a little too grey. Overall, I am satisfied at the advances that have been made, and my usual settings all look fantastic and so much better than anything before.6.8 inches of screen along with 300 PPI is definitely enough to satisfy most demands for resolution, and the extra space may be convincing for one to switch from physical books. The bezel itself also looks properly designed finally. That alone is also another huge deal. The sides are thin, the screen is the main attraction, and there is no awkwardness in reading versus a real book. All additions that make this is a positive buy over the other Kindles.There is an extremely tiny trail of adhesive in one corner and edge at the very bottom right near the backing material and black area of the bezel. Pretty minor all told. Most won't even notice things like this, and most Kindles will probably have such a minor flaw. Compared to the 2018 version, this thing seems like an actual professional product.The UI responsiveness was another issue in previous models, and I am happy to report this one is very fast. Massively faster than my 7th gen, and a decent improvement over the older model. The Paperwhite 2018 uses a Freescale/NXP i.MX6 SoloLite 1 GHz processor. Not terrible, but also not quite enough to match the newer NXP i.MX7D 1 GHz chip used in the Oasis 3 and this model. Again, a more refined version at every level compared to the older Paperwhite.For memory and storage, I can't see many people needing more than 8GB. I did fine on my last Kindle with much less. Unless you plan on starting a small library, 8GB of memory is a perfect fit for anyone's lifetime.As for the user interface, major changes have resulted in a much better flow in overall design for most Kindles from 2015 onward. The swipe down mechanic is leagues better than anything they've had before. The library UI that you tap in the upper left is again fast and finally consistent. These UI details are easy to spot in the included pictures with various lighting values. But they are available to most users outside of this product.Response and animation are a cut above their predecessors, and that should not be understated. I finally feel the Kindle is quick enough for my needs with digital reading. My 7th gen was abysmal. The 2018 version was slightly problematic. The newer page turn animation, however, was not to my liking, and I ended up sticking with the normal style. As a plus, the web browser is snappy and usable for those that need to quickly look something up on a search engine. Exiting in and out of menus is a breeze, and opening or downloading books was efficient. I still wish there was a download all option, so I will be downloading from the website instead.And speaking of default, the designers have made sure that this Kindle is ready to use without even touching a setting. They clearly invested a lot in understanding how people want their Kindle to look. I found almost all default options to be optimal. I added one step to boldness in fonts, and have toyed with the variable warmth quite a bit. Bookerly is a great font for reading, but there are obviously other options if you prefer. These things are basically as good as they need to be on this digital reader. More improvements with font selection could be possible, but are entirely superfluous to the current experience.Updating the firmware was painless for me past having to click no thanks for all the subscriptions Amazon wants to get you hooked on. No thanks. No issues with connections or anything of the sort. Charging works perfectly via USB-C, a far better connector than the micro version. Adding and subtracting to the library was fast and convenient.Aesthetics and materials are premium for the most part. Other than the aforementioned pinprick trail of adhesive, there were no outright imperfections that I can see. I don't really like the Oasis 3, but it's definitely similar to that version, with a better form factor.The leather case included with this bundle is what it is: completely overpriced but nearly mandatory for the perfect feel and weight. I can't stand the feel of the device without the included case. I highly recommend the bundle. The aesthetics look nice, and overall it's mostly the same as my last one. A bit easier to get in and out compared to 7th gen.At the heart of it all, this is still just another updated version of the Paperwhite. But it could be mandatory because it polishes the lighting and page turning to a degree that makes the old devices feel awkward. I don't see myself getting another one for a decade. And that leaves two questions remaining: How is the battery life, and is this worth the upgrade if you own the 2018 version...Battery life seems improved. I wouldn't call it all that great on full brightness, but it's definitely an upgrade from anything before. Battery life is critical, I have run into few issues with my normal settings. Right now, I can see that it drains decently fast on max brightness, but it also has an array of 17 LEDs lighting it. On lower brightness, it appears to be very conservative with battery life, much the same as last time but probably better. It's tough to say when you are comparing older batteries to newer ones. This will be an ongoing process to be updated in the review every now and then. On the lowest brightness it is off of course, for those that prefer the older Kindle experience and extended usage without a charge. This produces a charge that lasts a very long time.For me I see no reason to keep Wi-Fi on, and the complaints about that particular setting, coming from 2018, seem slightly obtuse. Shut it off when your library is downloaded. Problem solved. With full brightness, you aren't going to get a ton of life, but I also recommend against full brightness as it doesn't really resemble paper at that point. On medium settings, which I prefer, battery life seems completely acceptable and better than before.If you are currently using a device below the Paperwhite 2018, then definitely you could think about an upgrade if you are in the market for a new E-Reader. I cannot overstate how much better this is than my 7th gen. I rarely even used that model, and I will definitely be clocking in some time with this one due to the screen and response time. It's a huge motivating factor to actually take out my Kindle now. Previous versions do not match up, and this is the first time I can say I am impressed by a Kindle.Coming from 2018, I would say this is a fairly huge upgrade, and most will want to eventually make the change. The screen is too versatile to pass up, and the faster response time basically nails the previous version in its coffin. I don't think an immediate upgrade is necessary, but most will want this as their baseline going forward. The 2018 version has too many issues, and this fixes most of them.Economically, this might not be an option for many. To somewhat help out, you definitely will want to get this in the bundle with the leather case, which I included a picture of at the bottom. It's a nice case, way too expensive by itself, and kind of mandatory in my experience. The bundle also includes a trade-in option. Definitely DO NOT buy the case separately. No need to give Amazon any more of your money than necessary.Outside of that you can be sure I will remain critical of this device. If anything goes wrong, becomes damaged or defective, I will immediately add that info to my review. No shilling is allowed here. Freezes have gone completely away as of the recent firmware update in 1.14.1.1.For those on the fence, it is best to wait a few months to see how things turn out. For now, I enjoy the device and have only a few issues. Going forward I hope to actually use a Kindle consistently for the first time. If I rated the Paperwhite 2018 one star, then this one is around four stars. A worthy upgrade for anybody in the market. Will it replace my physical collection? Never.

"Kindle Paperwhite Signature Edition (32 GB) – With a 6.8"" display, wireless charging, and auto-adjusting front light – Without Lockscreen Ads – Black",5.0,Love my Kindle Paperwhite!,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on March 18, 2023",Color: Agave Green | Option: Without Kindle Unlimited,True,"I love having a Kindle Paperwhite! I was gifted this for my birthday and love it so much!My only complaint is the flashing white every couple of pages when set to dark mode, and the flashing black every few pages when in standard mode. It’s pretty dang jarring when reading in a dark, quiet room to have the screen flash white.I turned the page refresh button on & off & restarted my Kindle which luckily changed the flashing from every single page turn, to every few pages, but it’s still a “flaw” in this product that should be redesigned/fixed if possible. (Though from what I’ve read, it’s just how the tech is for Kindle.)I chose the Paperwhite over Oasis when reading reviews for the Oasis. Seems like a better buy but I’ll have to check out to see if the page lighting up in dark mode is a feature with Kindle Oasis too.Overall I am very happy with my Kindle Paperwhite. It’s radically improved my sleep cycles & quality of sleep. Now instead of scrolling on my phone at night, I’ve got my Paperwhite which is easy on my eyes. Reading my kindle on my phone still fatigued my eyes even in warm tone with dark background.I’m also pleased with how big the font can get. I’ve got Diabetic retinopathy & am blind in one eye with huge vision loss/blurry vision in the other eye. The big writing is so helpful for me to be able to still read.Even with the jarring, flashing light every couple of pages with this model, I would still rather have a Kindle than not.",8 people found this helpful
"Kindle Paperwhite Signature Edition (32 GB) – With a 6.8"" display, wireless charging, and auto-adjusting front light – Without Lockscreen Ads – Black",5.0,Signature vs Paperwhite: Observations from Owning Both,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on March 19, 2022",Color: Black | Option: Without Kindle Unlimited,True,"I own the 11th Gen (newest model 2022) standard Kindle Paperwhite and the Signature Paperwhite. I love them both. If dough is not the issue, I would buy the Signature model for fifty bucks more. Here’s some of my particular findings in use.Cases: Note that I do not like the Amazon cases because I don’t like folding over cover type cases; I prefer cases that simply help with holding the device.  I purchased the “MoKo Case for 6.8"" Kindle Paperwhite (11th Generation-2021) and Kindle Paperwhite Signature Edition, Ultra Clear Soft Flexible Transparent TPU Skin Bumper Back Cover Shell, Clear” from Amazon and it fits the Kindle ideally, and most importantly this case DOES go on the proprietary charging stand made by Anker and the charge does go through the case (that is, I do not need to remove the case to charge the Kindle in that charging stand).Battery: Amazon states that the Kindle 11th gen will hold a charge for 10 weeks, when used at limited brightness for 90 minutes a day (and a lot of other stipulations, like WiFi and Bluetooth off, etc). In reality, many may turn up the brightness, read more than 90 minutes, and Airplane mode on, or use other features that drain the battery faster (See audiobooks below). I have found that my battery drains faster than 10 weeks, but I am using the device with Airplane mode off, Wifi on, Bluetooth On. I do not like turning off wifi in particular because it MUST Be on to sync books between devices, and since I have two Kindle 11th gens, plus a MacBook, iPhone, iPad, and I read 5 books at a time simultaneously, I have no desire to turn wi-fi off.  Thus, having Qi charging is helpful…not mandatory but helpful.  Another BIG reason for the Qi charging is Audible audiobooks. I do listen to them through the Kindle itself, and the battery drains fairly quickly when listening to audiobooks.Memory Storage: The Kindle has 8 GB storage, but only 5.8 GB after their software OS.  The Signature Kindle has 32 GB storage, but only 28 GB after their software OS (there is slightly different software between the two models as the Signature supports more menu and charging features). So if you love downloaded “off-line” reading, and in particular if you enjoy having audiobooks in your downloaded library (they take much more storage than an e-book), the 32 GB is reassuring.Auto-light adjust: I can’t even detect that it’s doing anything, but if one rides a train daily to work and it passes through dark tunnels, this feature may be of benefit to you.Advertising free: Many forget the $20 value of the ad-free that is part of the Kindle Signature.  Even those that wouldn’t pony up for it on their own may enjoy it here as “icing on the cake” for the price difference.  I like seeing my own book cover on the sleep screen, and that is not possible with the “with ads” version. I thought I enjoyed the ads for editors choice books and book sales and stuff, but I much prefer the ad-free model.  And, little discussed fact, the ad-free version has one less swipe to get to your Library or current book every single time you turn on the Kindle. True!Dedicated Signature Charger Stand: I bought the Qi charging stand and like it greatly.  It does work with my “MoKo Case for 6.8"" Kindle Paperwhite (11th Generation-2021) and the Kindle Paperwhite Signature Edition, Ultra Clear Soft Flexible Transparent TPU Skin Bumper Back Cover Shell, Clear”., and charges through the case and the case fits the stand (but not quite as bump-proof as the Kindle without the case). I like that the stand sits quietly on my desk as I am working, or on my coffee table while I’m watching sports do I can read during commercials. I do not need to keep the AC cord attached to the stand at all times; sometimes I use the charger stand as simply a free-standing stand for either of my Kindles. I like that it can hold my Kindle 11th generation normal edition without Qi charging and I can read on it as an easel stand.  I feel the utility as an easel stand is underrated. Qi chargers in general are not free, and neither are easel stands, so coupling those two together, you get the price of this Anker model.  I find no issues with the size of the “wall wart” or the plug in the back of the stand. Some people complain with the charging stand that the white light indicator does not turn to another color, such as green, to indicate full charge.  A “work around” for this is to place the charging Kindle on the stand upside down; now the LED light at the bottom of the Kindle device itself, which does change color when fully charged, is face upward and easily seen. Frankly, there is no issue with simply assuming the Signature PW is charged after an hour or two. I like this stand much more than I thought I would.I’ve owned every Kindle since the first one! I use library Libby, and am an Audible and Kindle Unlimited subscribers. I guess you could say I’m a “power user”. I definitely prefer the Signature version, but both are good readers.  If I could change one thing about these Kindles, it would be to add a physical button like the Oasis. I realize that sounds outdated, but to reach and switch with the other hand, or reach thumb across screen to scrub, every page turn is a chore that is solved with an under-thumb button like Oasis. Additionally, the e-ink is good, but after two decades, one would think the text versus background contrast would be better…that is, darker text, whiter background. Instead, it remains darkest gray text in lightest gray background, not ideal.  Happy reading!",748 people found this helpful
"Kindle Paperwhite Signature Edition (32 GB) – With a 6.8"" display, wireless charging, and auto-adjusting front light – Without Lockscreen Ads – Black",5.0,Warm Option is a Game Changer,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on March 29, 2023",Color: Denim | Option: Without Kindle Unlimited,True,"I recently took to reading on a Kindle for convenience and because we have tons of books and they just take up too much space. I have adjusted quickly and really like it but on the previous device I used, my eyes got tired from the brightness and whiteness of the screen. I'm also concerned about anything that could affect sleep and I can't definitively say the light did but I can say I've had fewer bad nights since switching to this device and maxing out the warm light setting ( this feature is a game changer!).  I can read longer without my eyes getting kind of watery and tired. My only tiny complaint is the increased size and weight but this is by no means a deal breaker and I'm already used to it (plus I got a case with elastic bands for your hands which helps with one handed reading). I also prefer that this doesn't have ads. Overall thrilled with this purchase and highly recommend if you're considering starting or upgrading your kindle experience. I also love that I can still read Library books through whatever service the Library uses as well. Finally, I have only had to charge once since I purchased a couple weeks ago so the battery life is no joke.",
"Kindle Paperwhite Signature Edition (32 GB) – With a 6.8"" display, wireless charging, and auto-adjusting front light – Without Lockscreen Ads – Black",5.0,So easy!,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on March 11, 2023",Color: Agave Green | Option: Without Kindle Unlimited,True,"I grew up being an avid reader as a child, which continued into adulthood.  After a couple of moves, with books packed away in boxes and other things that interfered with reading as often as I used to, I started thinking about the fact that I haven’t read anything significant in years.I realized how much I missed it, and how much time I was wasting with my “nose in my cell phone,” rather than a book!  With those things in mind, I started reading reviews on Amazon to compare the various versions of Kindle.I’m so happy with my new Kindle Paperwhite!  I love the fact that there is significant storage to hold books to read without depending on Wi-Fi.  The auto adjust feature for various lighting conditions is very handy.  For me, the very best part is that when I pick it up, I can immediately begin reading where I left off!  No more opening a book to two (2) side by side pages, and having to think about where I left off, or worse, having a bookmark fall out.  No more having to decide which book to take with me, which I wasn’t doing anyway… I can have them all with me, any time I want, wherever I am.  I can drop it in my purse any time I go out;  you never know when you’ll find a few minutes to read, instead of wasting that time playing on a cell phone!Years ago, I resisted switching over to a Kindle because I preferred the feel of a book in my hand, and the satisfaction of physically turning each page.As the years passed, while becoming accustomed to electronic devices being part of everyday life, I now realize that physically holding a book, and the tactile pleasure of turning pages was not being enjoyed because I was no longer reading at all.Getting my Kindle has shown me what’s most important:  It has given back to me the ability to enjoy reading again.I am particularly pleased with the features of the new Kindle Paperwhite, but for anyone with a more limited budget, I have no doubt that the less expensive versions can also bring the joy of reading back into anyone’s life if they experienced the same gradual straying away from daily reading that I did.  I highly recommend it!",40 people found this helpful

There is nothing like a good book. But i don’t have time to do it as often as i like.  But my kindle paper white makes it easier for me read more! I don’t understand it, maybe it’s the screen that feels like i am reading an actual book, or the backlight that doesn’t hurt my eyes and lets me read at night when the house is quiet and the kids are in bed without disturbing my husband with a light. Possible it’s the feature in the corner that lets me set time left in chapter that makes the books seem more manageable.  Whatever it is, i a refound my love of reading and i couldn’t be happier!

The first one (2nd generation) was great, but really slow and the OS was terrible. My second one, this one, I love for reading and taking with me. It is still very slow and to organize books, it is awful. I got on to the Amazon website and was able to sync things pretty well and it was much faster. The Whispersync is a great addition, but Amazon, you have go to know that there are easier and quicker ways to do this and to auto download everything I buy is such a bad idea. There should be easier ways to do it and to force one way on someone is poor UX. Put it in the welcome part of setting up your Kindle. The third Kindle I have is the 10th generation fire and it does not have whispersync and everything gets installed on it and all the organization setup on my second kindle does not work on the Kindle Fire 10th generation.

But I had just bought the nook glow light 4 a couple months ago and the screen on it wasn’t that saturated and things were hard to see on it and almost seemed blurry, I had to refresh the nook over and over to get it to load and that’s when I started researching KINDLE. I was hesitant but I decided to go for it! IM SOOOOO GLAD I DID! This thing is light weight, the screen is Saturated and easy to read, fast when turning pages and feels ALOT like a real book! Compared to the glow light the screen on this is more of a white colored light rather then blue like the glow light! This kindle is very very nice! It’s battery has only gone down 3% and I’ve read on this thing for 4 hours yesterday afternoon and 3 hours today! The agave green color is also very beautiful! It’s like a greyish greenish color. I got the 32gb signature edition with no ads and when I ordered this I DIDNT get the 3 months free one for kindle but when I set up my kindle it offered it to me so I took it. I’d like to mention it DOES connect to LIBBY library app and it sent my book right over to my kindle and I read a book off it already! I did check the box to have it set up with my account already through prime and that helped. I also want to say it has Goodreads on it already and you can actually scroll through Goodreads on the kindle!

"Kindle Paperwhite Signature Edition (32 GB) – With a 6.8"" display, wireless charging, and auto-adjusting front light – Without Lockscreen Ads – Black",5.0,"Hands Down the BEST Paperwhite Made to Date!!! And, I've Owned a Few!","Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on February 1, 2023",Color: Black | Option: Without Kindle Unlimited,True,"If you saw something good written about this device, There ya go! I have had a number of Kindles over the years. I had a Touch, first. One of the grey ones, not a touch screen. It was fantastic! Enter the Paperwhite, I waited until the 2 before I got one. It was a game changer for reading. Having the light built in! I sadly lost it, and got a 3. I had always liked my 2 better. The 4 came along, and though I had lost a 3 to a storm while thru hiking, I still had insurance on it. BUT!!! The 5, 11th gen, Signature Edition came along... Well, another gripe I had with my 3v2, was that the 3 had a reduction in storage, and a smaller battery. That is why I liked my 2 better. Plus, the light was this greenish tinted colour I had preferred. BACK TO THE PWSE!What attracted me:+++ MUCHO storage!+++ Water resistance (I know the 4 had it, but remember, I had skipped)+++ USB C - Long over due (many other companies are still guilty of this (Apple, I am pointing at you)+++ Battery life CLAIMS - they were merely Amazon statements at this point. Now, I have not known  claims, by companies in this department to be typically truthful, beyond ""lab conditions"". The battery  life lived up to it!+++ BIGGER SCREEEN!!! I knew I would love it, when I saw one next to a 4/3/2/1 sized model, I was sold.Things that I didn't think I cared about but seemed like they could be neat:+++ Adjustable lighting - I like it much more than I thought I would! It has never been perfect on any  device by any company, and it isn't here. But, it does learn, and it does well. It definitely adds value+++ Warm lighting - Now this one, I though ""woopidy doooooooo"" But, after actually experiencing it, it is  something I LOVE, and would NOT give up! It is a WOOO HOOOOOO!!!!Something I thought I wanted, but only used it once to see if it worked:+++ Wireless charging. Although I like this on other devices, on my PWSE, the case I went with doesn't  allow for it. But, I really don't care. the USB C is readily available as most of my other devices use it.  And, it charges up in an hour or less. As I only charge it between 3 - 7 weeks at a time, and I have a  charger by my bed, it is no inconvenience to charge it that way. Some people do love it for theirs  though. Not at all anything to with Amazon or the Paperwhite, just my personal experience. It's there  should I ever change my mind, I suppose.As I have had this device since January of 2022, I can say without a doubt that it has met every expectation, and definitely deserves the high rating it maintains in reviews.",91 people found this helpful

"Kindle Paperwhite Signature Edition (32 GB) – With a 6.8"" display, wireless charging, and auto-adjusting front light – Without Lockscreen Ads – Black",3.0,Kindle App vs Actual Kindle?,"Reviewed in the United States on March 8, 2023",Color: Denim | Option: Without Kindle Unlimited,True,"Since 2016 I have been reading exclusively via the kindle app on whichever 8” fire tablet was available that year and had few complaints. Last week my tablet stopped connecting to wifi so it was time to replace it. I spent an entire day reading Kindle Paperwhite reviews and weighing it against getting a new 8” fire tablet. Obviously I went with the Kindle Paperwhite and here is my TL;DR: aside from the vastly superior battery life and water proofing, the Kindle app on a tablet is much better than the actual Kindle.First a difference I expected: the kindle app displayed all my books in color, obviously the Kindle Paperwhite is black and white. I didn’t think it would bother me but I do miss seeing all my colorful books in my library.The rest of the cons:The Paperwhite is SO SO SLOW compared to the app. When you tap to turn the page there is a slight delay and it often flashes while turning. Pressing the screen on/off button takes a few seconds to work, and navigating the store and your library is a MESS. I figured the actual kindle would be quicker to navigate through since it only has one job but nope. It’s so slow it’s almost a nightmare.The Paperwhite does not show you reading insights like the kindle app does. I have missed keeping up with my streak and earning awards/badges as I goThe Paperwhite is less reliable about connecting your book to GoodReads to show as “currently reading” than the app. I have read 3 books on the kindle since receiving it 4 days ago and I’ve had to manually add them all to my GoodReads profile despite the pop up at the beginning of the book that declares it is going to add it to “currently reading” on GoodReads.The Paperwhite’s “glare free” screen is not actually glare free. I often have to hold it at an angle to read the text. The screen is also way more prone to smudges than the tablet and because the e-ink is less crisp it makes it even fuzzier.Adding to that point—the display is far less crisp.  I’m near sighted so I typically do not wear my glasses to read, however, the far less crisp display almost makes me feel like I need the glasses on.Because the Paperwhite is in black and white only, you can obviously only highlight passages in one color. On the app there are 3 and I utilized them for different things (blue for important story points, pink for errors, and yellow for anything that made me laugh).The bookmark function on the Paperwhite is really annoying. You have to tap the upper right portion of the screen and then tap the plus sign to add the book mark. On the app you simply tap the upper right portion of the screen and it’s bookmarked. I lost a bunch of things I’d like to bookmark not realizing I needed to hit the plus sign.This last point is definitely just me being picky/finicky but I really hate that the screen doesn’t turn off. I don’t know why but it annoys me.These annoyances aren’t enough to want to go through the hassle of returning the Paperwhite to purchase a fire tablet but if I had the decision to make again, knowing what I know now, I probably would have purchased a new tablet instead.",19 people found this helpful

I don’t miss either one. I never lose my spot. The ability to highlight and a dictionary all on my reading page is something you never have in the books I’ve always had.

I’d recommend this Kindle to everyone. Should I ever upgrade, I’d purchase one with colors. Y’all have made my life easier. I don’t have to so about an overdue book and save time not having to constantly go to the library. Don’t get me wrong: I grew up in the library and they are necessary for all, fun and calming.

It crapped out with connecting to Wi-Fi a couple of years ago. It wasn't a big deal for me until Amazon stopped allowing you to download your eBooks and transfer via usb. I considered the Oasis because I thought I could not live without my page turn buttons. Settled on this one because of the valentine's day sale. I just could not pass up that big of a discount for the newer software and storage size. I freaking love it! I can see my book covers! It auto groups my series into folders!

"Kindle Paperwhite Signature Edition (32 GB) – With a 6.8"" display, wireless charging, and auto-adjusting front light – Without Lockscreen Ads – Black",4.0,Hardware is great. Now improve the operating system.,"Reviewed in the United States on March 2, 2023",Color: Black | Option: Without Kindle Unlimited,True,"I've liked and owned several Paperwhites because they are made for one thing: reading. Amazon's other tablets just don't appeal to me. Several months ago I traded up to the Signature Edition from a 2015 Paperwhite, and this new model resolves just about every hardware quibble I've ever had with previous versions. See reviews by others for highlights on physical improvements, including display, charging port, etc.While there have been definite improvements to the Paperwhite operating system over the years, interaction with it is still difficult when one wants to change display brightness, type size, etc. Some changes, typeface size controls for example, don't feel like improvements, they mostly seem more difficult. Weirdly, once one has figured out the correct way to get where one wants to go within the controls, the process is convoluted enough that it doesn't stick in the brain, and one must rediscover it again later. Overall, the OS is still clunky in several important places.There's also a bug that has been present for ages and seemingly never addressed: the progress indicator disappears from the display quite frequently. It seems the theme switches on its own from the default to something off the rails, or the progress indicator just disappears from the default theme settings, I'm not sure. I work around this by creating a custom theme that mimics my default settings, then deleting every other theme option except for default (I'm fearful of what might happen if I delete it). When the progress indicator disappears, I open themes and switch from whichever theme is currently selected to the other, default or custom.In some ways the Paperwhite is a pretty mature product at this point, but there is still plenty of room for improvement within the operating system. Maybe a full, ground-up  rewrite of the OS is in order?",14 people found this helpful
"Kindle Paperwhite Signature Edition (32 GB) – With a 6.8"" display, wireless charging, and auto-adjusting front light – Without Lockscreen Ads – Black",5.0,Better than I expected!,"Reviewed in the United States on February 19, 2023",Color: Black | Option: Without Kindle Unlimited,True,"As I was shopping for a new Kindle, I narrowed my search down to an Oasis or a Paperwhite. After careful consideration of features and reviews I decided on the Paperwhite and it has not disappointed me in the least! I could not be happier with this purchase! I've even decided to gift one to a friend. It's nice not having to charge the battery every day as was a major complaint of many of the Oasis reviewers. It has a USB-C port meaning I don't have to keep a micro USB cord around. The screen is plenty bright with its 17 leds as opposed to the battery draining 25 leds of the Oasis. You can adjust not only the brightness, but the warmth of the page color making it more off-white to your preference. And it even has a dark mode if you prefer for nighttime reading. Plus, with 32gb of space you have plenty of room for your book and audio book library as desired. All for about half the price of the Oasis. I'm not here to talk you out of an Oasis, do your homework and make your own choice, but these are the things I love about my new Paperwhite. I also haven't had the same issue as other users of accidentally turning the pages, but that's probably because I hold my Kindle at the bottom with four fingers and just reach up and tap with my thumb to turn the page. Maybe that's just me. I find it nice not having to reach for a button to turn the page. I also haven't had any issues with the power button placement at the bottom of the device as others have complained about as it takes a fair amount of pressure to activate it, so I'm not sure how people are accidentally turning it off. Overall, very pleased with this Kindle and so far 0 complaints!",29 people found this helpful
"Kindle Paperwhite Signature Edition (32 GB) – With a 6.8"" display, wireless charging, and auto-adjusting front light – Without Lockscreen Ads – Black",3.0,"So close, but so far away from perfection","Reviewed in the United States on March 9, 2023",Color: Black | Option: Without Kindle Unlimited,True,"I have mixed feelings about this product and about the entire Kindle ecosystem. There is no doubt that this is the only game in town; none of the others (nook, sony, kobo) give anything close to the total ecosystem experience of Amazon kindle. The number of books, features on the devices, hardware and software offered etc. Amazon has clearly put a lot of thought into this, as book selling is their claim to fame. However, taking this into account I am at disbelief why, coming so close to perfection, they stopped where they did. There are clearly some serious shortcomings with the  entire setup:1. Kindle Paperwhite itself: capacitive screen that gets dirty, many of the books are not rendered correctly,  Abysmal translation, dictionary options. For gods sakes how awful is Bing at translation! No buttons to turn pages. Device restarts(crashes) once in a while when too many books loaded etc.2. Kindle for PC. Must've been programmed in late 90's and left like that. What a piece of cr@p clunky application. Right click menu is buggy. Only limited support for dictionaries/translation.3. Kindle for smartphone. Somewhat better, but has many of the problems such as rendering of books correctly.Additionally:WhisperSync not working correctly. I often have to swipe to get to the latest read page between devices.And if I switch between books the latest one isn't being opened.There is also Amazon cloudreader where you can read books in the browser, but you can only read Amazon's own books, not your own pdf or epub files.Getting books onto the device:This is a mess as well. There are three options:1. Email. Your kindle comes with a unique email address and you can send your ebooks there. This is ancient method of file transfer, but it's the only one that works reliably with Kindle. Meaning whatever you send will be properly formatted and will show up on your kindle.2. WebUI upload. You can drag and drop files into your browser(after logging into your account) and they will be transferred to your library. They however will NOT be formatted. If you attempt to transfer pdf/djvu it'll just show up like that and will be impossible to read.3. Sideloading. You can connect kindle via usb cable to pc and drag/drop files onto it. Same problem as with #2. above. It'll transfer the files, but will not format them properly.This brings me to the last point. Kindle claims to support many formats, but realistically if you want a comfortable reading experience you needs to get one of the ebook formats, such as epub or asw3. Anything else, such as pdf/djvu, will be a mess and impossible to read.Overall it's a mixed experience and I wish Amazon would finish the job by this point (after all this is 11th iteration of the device). It's the only game in town, so in many ways people have no were to go. But faults are many and certainly other options should be considered.",One person found this helpful
"Kindle Paperwhite Signature Edition (32 GB) – With a 6.8"" display, wireless charging, and auto-adjusting front light – Without Lockscreen Ads – Black",5.0,Easily the Best I've Experienced,"Reviewed in the United States on January 5, 2023",Color: Black | Option: Without Kindle Unlimited,True,"I've experienced almost every Kindle since they arrived on the scene and this, so far, is my favorite. My previous Paperwhite was the Generation 10. Bigger screen, faster response all around (touchscreen & page-turning, etc., I like the screen-light change for evenings. It is bigger than the 10, but not heavier. It charges faster and the battery life is incredible. Like any other device, battery life is affected by how you use it (audiobooks seem to use battery life faster than the Kindle format). I haven't used the Scribe so cannot speak to any differences there.People have written about how they don't like the on/off button where it is. I have found on my Gen10 and this Signature that if I make my reading screen go landscape instead of portrait, this solves a lot of problems. No accidentally turning off my device AND the sort of top-heavy thing that happens even with paper books is eliminated. I can read longer without making my hand tired. One must make this change in a book by using the Aa icon and changing the Orientation in the Layout section. If you save this Theme, you can re-instate it if necessary. When I figured this out in my Gen10, it made a world of difference.This is the first device I've felt like I would want to have all my books available to me on my Kindle, Kindle & Audible. I've used the option of sending PDFs to my Kindle as well as books purchased elsewhere or library books in Kindle format. It all works well on the Signature.I purchased a case for my Signature as I do most all my devices. I don't live an in-one-place life and this is the best way to keep my devices safe as I can from being damaged accidently from being pulled in and out of a purse or backpack or suitcase while visiting away from home. I take my Kindle most everywhere I go as I listen to audio in the car and sometimes at work when I'm working alone. With Bluetooth earbuds, it is easy to put a pause on an audiobook and answer the phone. I don't think I'm alone in having this help me be productive in working through tedious projects.I tend to purchase the Kindle AND the audiobook together whenever I can as I will read in both formats over the time I'm reading any particular book. In my Gen10, I wasn't successful in purchasing the Kindle & Audible book through the device. I had to go on my computer to do that successfully. With the Signature, it worked quite well. I'm very happy about that as that is my preferred outcome. That means I love Whispersync. Since I also have a Fire, this keeps me in the right place at the right time, anywhere.",53 people found this helpful

But, I can always still read those on my iPad.Love that the kindle is not much bigger than my phone, so fits. Easily in my purse.

"Kindle Paperwhite Signature Edition (32 GB) – With a 6.8"" display, wireless charging, and auto-adjusting front light – Without Lockscreen Ads – Black",4.0,"Paperwhite Signature Ed, OK","Reviewed in the United States on March 7, 2023",Color: Black | Option: Without Kindle Unlimited,True,"Went from 6” kindle Paperwhite to 6.8” Paperwhite Signature Ed. Was it worth it?My 6” Paperwhite (2017) was having battery life issues and I was tired of the touch screen lag and with the 6.8 Signature I saw the opportunity for a larger, better lit screen and for better battery life. I also hoped that the lag would be lessened.So - review… Bigger screen is a good thing but the smaller bezel around the L/R sides and top is torture, especially with a case. It’s difficult to hold it or switch hands without touching/grazing the screen and moving forward or backwards 1 or more pages. It’s frustrating and could have been prevented with a slightly wider and raised bezel. In this case the Signature’s bezel and screen are a single smooth piece. A raised bezel like my 2017 Paperwhite would help, too.The Signature battery is flat out better right off. Fast, long lasting charges. Big plus. Lag, though present, is greatly reduced.Would I buy it again? Honestly. Knowing what I now know…probably not. I think I’d have waited and hoped the next iteration would fix the screen bezel page flipping issue. But it’s still better AND my issues may be user finger issues though my hands and fingers are yawningly average.",2 people found this helpful

I like the Paperwhite in general, because I can read outdoors or indoors, no matter the lighting, and the text looks like a real book.I actually got onto Kindles when my dad had rotator cuff surgery. He couldn’t use his arm, so it was easier for him to read with the original Kindle. After he was healed up, he gave it to me. I noticed I read so much more after having it.When you put a cover on it, it does sort of feel like you’re reading a real book. Again, the text is very similar, except you can adjust the font size if you need it or want it. You can also highlight parts of the book for future reference, take notes, or even listen to Audiobooks with Bluetooth earbuds with this one (that part is new.)A few more improvements they made: 1. This one is much faster than the one before it. It isn’t as pokey. 2. The Home Screen is better.Some were saying Kindle Unlimited isn’t on it, not true. Also, Whispersync works great with Libby, the library app. It also works with Audible books.I really like this model, and I think I’ll give my old Kindle to someone at the dialysis clinic I work at.",5 people found this helpful

"Kindle Paperwhite Signature Edition (32 GB) – With a 6.8"" display, wireless charging, and auto-adjusting front light – Without Lockscreen Ads – Black",5.0,Best Kindle Thus Far,"Reviewed in the United States on December 30, 2022",Color: Black | Option: Without Kindle Unlimited,True,"My Oasis would no longer hold a good and reliable charge, so I started looking into current Kindle options.  Having gifted a Kindle Signature edition to my daughter for Christmas, and having her simply rave about it, I decided to take advantage of the Kindle trade-in policy (60.00 gift card with my Oasis trade in and free shipping of my recycled Kindle back to Amazon - with 20% off the new Kindle) and I sprung for the Signature edition, 32 GB, auto lighting, wireless USB-C charging.Boy, am I pleased with my choice!  This Kindle has a noticeably larger screen than my older Oasis, it has clearer resolution, it is easy to hold and it has much larger storage.  No more fumbling for a plug-in cord to charge it - simply set it down on the charging pad and forget about it.  The Kindle Signature has become the perfect upgrade for me.I LOVE the wireless charging.  No need to buy the recommended Anker-made-for-Amazon 10 w charger - I bought the new Anker 315 10 w rapid charger for 10.00 plus tax from Amazon and it works flawlessly.  Full charge in 25 minutes.Before springing for this Kindle, I read the comments of others about the lack of the page turn button and the concern that you might, by accident, turn off the device with the On/Off button the the bottom of this Kindle, but, as others have also said, I did not find either of these things to be a problem at all.  Yes, the page turn button might be nice - I did use it regularly on the Oasis - but it is not at all a deal breaker for me not to have it on the Signature and I haven’t once mistakenly hit the On/Off button to inadvertently turn off the device.  So, to me, these criticisms are not things that bother me - or get at all in the way of my enjoyment of the Signature.I also do very much like the new USB-C charging port.  It adds a new, updated feature to the Kindle family.The Kindle is such a terrific device for us reading enthusiasts - IMHO, this one with the larger, higher resolution screen, incredible battery life, wireless charging, no ads, largest storage of all Kindkes is the bomb - especially with the Amazon Kindle trade in policy and 20% discount on the Signature.Couldn’t be happier with my decision.

The screen is much better, the size is more compact and I love the auto dim adjustment. The 32Gb of memory is more than I will ever need. One of the best things is the ultra long battery life. I can go an entire month reading every day and still not need to charge it.Two things I don't like: sometimes when ""turning"" pages it will jump a page which is annoying. But the biggest gripe is the placement of the power button which is on the bottom of the device. I like to hold the Kindle in one hand with a finger or two supporting the bottom. Of course often enough I hit that power button and the Kindle turns off. Having it at the top would have made much more sense. Other than that though I'm very happy with it.",

"Kindle Paperwhite Signature Edition (32 GB) – With a 6.8"" display, wireless charging, and auto-adjusting front light – Without Lockscreen Ads – Black",3.0,Uncomfortable and a little overrated when compared to an older model,"Reviewed in the United States on October 28, 2022",Color: Black | Option: Without Kindle Unlimited,True,"I'm coming from a 7th generation Paperwhite that's held up well over time. It's obviously slower than the Signature, and the battery has a little less staying power than in the past, but otherwise my 7th generation is great and a pleasure to read from. It's so great, in fact, that I have struggled to commit to this newer model since I got it a few months ago. The biggest upgrades with it are speed, wireless dock charging, USB-C standardization, and the page warmth functionality. The biggest downside is worse ergonomics if you have smaller hands and particular layout preferences.THE SIGNATURE IS KIND OF UNCOMFORTABLE TO USEBy far, my biggest complaint is the Kindle Signature is physically uncomfortable for me to use. If you've got large hands, you might be fine, but if you've got smaller hands, I think the potential for discomfort is higher. For me, the Signature is *just* large enough that it's awkward to hold one-handed and even causes me some pain to do so for extended periods, and it's *just* small enough that it feels awkward in a different way to hold with two hands. As someone who already widens margins and linespacing, I'm *personally* not looking for a larger viewing space (just an e-ink display), but I'll tolerate it...provided it doesn't ruin comfort. Here, it comes close to ruining it.Adding to the frustration is how thin and slick the device is. Let's start with the thinness. The idea that thinner is better is coming from the phone market, but readers are (somewhat) looking to replace the physical experience of holding a book, which is *not* a thin object and is also bigger than a phone. Holding the Signature, I get marks on my hands, especially when propping my hand along the edge while lying down and reading on my side. With my 7th generation, this never happens because, while it is thin, it is not super thin; it's got a soft, chunky edge that is gentle on the hands.A CASE IS A MUSTJust as the device's thinness seems to be coming from the phone market, so, too, does the device's slick back. The back of the Signature is so slick that I honestly think it's a ploy to get you to buy an official case to make it more usable—which then makes the device heavier to use. This thing slides like crazy on anything remotely soft, which, when coupled with the thin edge, makes for very annoying reading in certain positions.Between this and the fact that the touch screen is no longer semi-protected by a beveled frame edge, I would think this version of the Kindle is much more susceptible to damage if you drop it or stuff it into a zippered pouch. I've had two other Kindles and never bought a case for them because, provided you tucked them in a soft space/bag, they were fine. With the Signature, I feel I need a case just to use the e-reader comfortably at all.I WANT AN E-READER, NOT A TABLETRemember how I said there's no longer a beveled frame edge? There are pros and cons to that. The pro is that it makes for a smoother swiping experience. The con is that I think it exists mainly because the Signature is trying to be both a tablet and an e-reader. The problem with this, of course, is that if you're buying a tablet, you don't want an e-ink display, and if you're buying an e-ink display, you're consciously avoiding a tablet for your reading experience. I don't know which features are driving the Kindle more toward a tablet-like experience, but I'm skeptical.I could be way off base, but auto-adjusting light and dark mode are the features I suspect they've traded the most for, and they're just not worth it. It's not that hard to adjust brightness and never has been. And an e-ink dark mode just isn't as good as a backlit LED dark mode. It literally can't be because of how an e-ink display works. I gave this mode a shot, but I can't imagine using it, not when the page warmth functionality helps achieve similar comfort in low light conditions while looking a lot more natural.EXPECT A GLAREWhatever is driving the more tablet-like feel, there is a big cost, and it comes most of all in the form of an exposed screen and glare. Take a look at my pics of the 7th generation versus the Signature. I know which I'd rather have in the sun or even in a room with certain lighting/bulbs.The other cost is to the touch surface itself. Before buying, I did see people complaining about how the Signature picks up fingerprints easily. I didn't think much of it. But those negative comments are right. It's noticeable.VERDICTI don't *hate* the Signature, but as far as an upgrade goes...it doesn't feel like much of one. In several ways, it feels like a downgrade, at least for me. I'm an avid enough reader that I ultimately decided to keep both devices, but I'm sort of annoyed.",199 people found this helpful

The margin adjustment is handy, but I wish there were one in between skinny and middle. Battery life is great. Another peeve is the page count. First it’s on the bottom as well as in settings. Because it’s on the bottom it’s easy to tap inadvertently. Took awhile to figure out why it was changing by itself whenever I held the thing. Would also be helpful if it had a page out in relation to the whole book. Overall I’m happy with it and the features that are good are very good. I’d recommend.",

All my minor complaints aside, I truly love this device and use it daily. I have no complaints with regard to my daily use. If you have the Kindle paperwhite I had before, it's not worth upgrading unless you want to treat yourself. I have no regrets about the purchase, as I wanted to treat myself. If you don't have a Kindle, this is the best, and you will enjoy it.The reasons I upgraded:-Larger screen. Nice, not necessary but apprecated-Dark mode. Old generations didn't have this (thanks, Amazon, for artificially limiting older generations' software)-USB-C. I was way too excited about this, but I stand by it.I was concerned that the flush glass screen would be worse than my old paperwhite's recessed screen. It is, but not noticeably so, which I'm pleasantly surprised to say. It's less paper-y than the old Kindles, but makes the Kindle look very clean and crisp. It's plenty responsive, and there's still enough bezel to hold it without touching the screen.It also has the same ppi (Pixels per inch) of my 2015 Kindle, and the new screen type makes it less clear because of the layers. I was concerned about that too, but it's not noticeable.Side-loading books is still very easy with new versions of Calibre.Dark mode is great for reading in bed with the lights off without bothering a partner next to you in bed. I upgraded primarily for the dark mode, as regular mode is too bright for me when I'm trying to go to sleep (same for real books with a reading light).It wirelessly charges on both of my phone chargers, one of which is one of the stand-style chargers (like the Amazon-branded Kindle one). I'm a little surprised that the larger Kindle still works on my phone's charging stand, and it is an excellent little surprise.A couple other notes for you future owners:-Don't buy the Amazon-branded cases for this generation. They're a rip-off and poorly designed this generation. There are many generic cases that work just as well, such as Ayotu's. I use that case for when I travel with the Kindle in a bag.-Don't buy the Amazon-branded USB wall adapters. They're ridiculously overpriced, and their maximum wattage is below the Kindle's maximum charging wattage. Amazon scam.-Don't buy the Amazon Kindle charging stand. It's got a weird proprietary cable to hook into the wall. You're better off getting one flat wireless charging pad, as pretty soon (if you're not already there), your phone, earbuds, and Kindle will all charge wirelessly, and a flat pad will be able to fit all of them. How often will you really need to charge your Kindle, anyways?-I got a Harris Tweed sleeve from SarahJayneDesi9ns on Etsy, and highly recommend it. It's beautiful.Other miscellaneous gripes:-It's a ripoff that Amazon charges for you to remove ads from a product you bought, but that's not relevant to this version, as there is no ad version with wireless charging.-It's a ripoff that I couldn't have dark mode on my old paperwhite. It's black and white. It's not too difficult to push a software update to it to make it white and black. They just wanted me to upgrade (and it worked). Buying this product supports that corporate mentality.-The screen is the same ppi and slightly blurrier than my 2015 Kindle.-To reiterate, the main upgrades are a charging port that Android phones have used since 2008 and a software update that they wouldn't let my 2015 Kindle have.I still love this Kindle and will use it daily for years to come. For being a mainstream product, I really appreciate Kindles' longevity, and I truly hope this one will last for years like the previous generations have.",30 people found this helpful
"Kindle Paperwhite Signature Edition (32 GB) – With a 6.8"" display, wireless charging, and auto-adjusting front light – Without Lockscreen Ads – Black",5.0,It’s Great!,"Reviewed in the United States on February 20, 2023",Color: Black | Option: Without Kindle Unlimited,True,"I bought two of these on sale as gifts for both my mom and older sister. They are both avid readers that were missing their chances to read more. They take great care of their paperbacks and couldn’t bare to stuff them in a bag and don’t have the vision to read well on phone screens.  These were a surprise and they loved them! None of us had ever used e-readers before and the slow refresh rate was definitely a shock, but the overall sturdiness, size and actual reading experience are phenomenal. I like the 32gb option because they do tend to lean towards audio books when exercising or doing menial tasks and anything that leaves them worry free is gold in my book. I recommend the paper white signature edition. It is what it claims to be and that’s all I can ask. Note: if the slow loading drives you bonkers while looking for new books, consider downloading the kindle app on another device to search out what you want. It’ll load into your library and show up on your kindle :)",3 people found this helpful
"Kindle Paperwhite Signature Edition (32 GB) – With a 6.8"" display, wireless charging, and auto-adjusting front light – Without Lockscreen Ads – Black",5.0,Perfect for no frills reading,"Reviewed in the United States on January 16, 2023",Color: Black | Option: Without Kindle Unlimited,True,"I had an old Fire tablet given to me years ago. It would last only a few days on one charge with limited use and its responsiveness had gotten very slow (from turning it on to getting the kindle app open and reading would take a few minutes). I upgraded when this was on sale right before Christmas.The battery life is amazing. I'm an average reader so one charge will last a long time - down 30% after 3 weeks with intermittent reading. Even keeping the wifi on full time doesn't affect it.I can't attest to reading in the sun yet, but the warmth setting is so much better than my previous tablet. Its perfect for nighttime reading without bothering my husband. Just like with my phone, I have automatic warmth setting turned on.Very easy to set up and use. Bought a cover and I like that it automatically opens up to exactly where I left off, and turns off when I close. If I leave the cover open, I also like that it shows what book I'm reading.If I had to list one negative thing, it's that I have small hands and it's wider than my old tablet so feels slightly uncomfortable if I try to wrap my hand around the back to hold it. Without the bulk of an actual book, though, it's still not bad weight-wise.As for the power button on the bottom, that's been a non-issue. I've never accidentally bumped it.EDIT: After one full month of usage and powering through 2 more books in the last week and a half, I'm at 19% battery life. I am blown away by how long this has lasted.SECOND EDIT: Finally got a chance to use in bright sunlight on a road trip. It was lovely being able to read with zero issues with the sun glaring in the car. Means it will be extra easy to read outside in the summer.",18 people found this helpful
"Kindle Paperwhite Signature Edition (32 GB) – With a 6.8"" display, wireless charging, and auto-adjusting front light – Without Lockscreen Ads – Black",1.0,My 4th Paperwhite: REALLY!??,"Reviewed in the United States on December 12, 2022",Color: Black | Option: Without Kindle Unlimited,True,"For those of you who aren’t up to reading this long saga, here is my best advice:  DO NOT BUY A PAPERWHITE! Here’s how I came to this conclusion:I received Paperwhite Signature edition with upgraded memory for Christmas 2021. I admit, at first I (mostly) loved it. It replaced my Voyage, which I LOVED, but had slowed way down, downloading had become so difficult, downloading new books often failed. The speed of my new Paperwhite was fabulous (at first). I loved some of the UI’s changes.I absolutely HATE being forced to deal with a grid of book covers that are nearly impossible to read! Yes, a list is a choice for the library page, but even that uses up valuable space with— you guessed it— book covers. I also dislike the fact that the Home page mostly advertises books. Yes, I know there are many more books available, but if I want to browse, I’ll go to the Store. Don’t use space on a kindle I (well, my son) paid for!  Use your own space, I.e., the StoreI like having the choice to list titles by series. This can be convenient, especially since each title’s order is listed. However, this aside, the so-called organization of all kindles I have had (early kindle, Voyage, and now Paperwhite) is laughable. I rely heavily on collections. Unfortunately, it only allows one level of differentiation within a collection, therefore no way to identify the sequence of titles within a series. Why couldn’t the series feature be available within a collection?As it is, I choose the title I wish to read next in a collection, then must go to the series featured in my library. Come on! And choosing my next book from a listing of ALL my 1000+ titles— with no differentiation other than alphabetically by author, title (don’t make me laugh!) or “recently,” is impossible.I also like having control over brightness and warmth of the screen. I really like being able to simply set my kindle on its charger. Unlike others, I’ve had little trouble with it charging, even with the cover in place (as long as I don’t place it upside down!)I very much appreciate the developers’  putting the clock back at the top of each page I’m reading. It was there in my Voyage— but NOT my first PaperWhite. It was available by clicking at the top; but this required interrupting my book. Without a clock in view, I tend to lose track of time when I’m reading. So I was happy to see it back at the top of the page when I received my most recent PaperWhite.Right. My biggest issue by far is that I just received my FOURTH PaperWhite in less than a year! The first one— the one I received from my wonderful son last year— just froze in a very few weeks. It wouldn’t do anything. A hard reset didn’t help. So I called Amazon. The customer service representative was very nice. He asked me to take certain actions, all of which I’d tried based on recommendations from YouTubers, but he wanted me to try again. So I did. Didn’t help. Then he said, “No problem. I’ll. send you a new one “ and he did. Which was great, but I must confess, I saw it as a problem. I spent days downloading my extensive library— about a thousand at that time.So I received my SECOND PaperWhite, spent days downloading everything again (which meant NOT reading on it). And a few weeks after that, you guessed it, it froze.  Rinse, repeat. I received my THIRD PaperWhite. Same deal. Except this time when I called Amazon, the rep taught me to do a variation of a hard reset. Basically, he told me to hold the bottom button through many resets,  approximately 10), without releasing it. And if it doesn’t work at first, try again. It worked!I thought that was great!  And every few weeks, it froze again, and I would do multiple resets, and it worked. UNTIL several days ago. This time, it didn’t freeze out of the blue. Instead, various things failed to work. At first, just the “deals” page didn’t display. Then it wouldn’t access “Settings.”  I did a hard reset (not multiples as above), but nothing seemed to change. More failures, but I did have access to my library — until it refused to open any book (at this point, I have 1200+. Have you SEEN all the free books available? Some of them are good. I’ve found several “favorite” authors that way.)I had called Amazon with the first issue, and was just waiting for the new one. BTW, I’m pretty sure all these replacements are “refurbished,” not new.  I REALLY wish that I had accepted a refund, offered after the first two quit working. I suspect this pattern will continue, with me doing very hard resets to keep this PaperWhite limping along, until the warranty runs out and I end up with a frozen PaperWhite, and depending on my old Voyage to read my e-books.Honestly, I prefer hardcovers.  However, I have spinal damage and have been totally disabled 20+ years. I have issues holding hardcovers, and the problem is getting worse. I’ve even begun replacing some of my many, many paper books with kindle editions. It is much easier for me to read for hours on end holding a kindle, due to their smaller, lighter size. So I’ve been moving to kindles.I hoped initially that there was a software problem, and the developers would be able to fix it, and download it in an update. This is a new version, so that would be understandable. But it hasn’t happened, so I’ve come to believe this is an integral hardware issue that can’t be rectified until the next rebuild.My advice is simply DON’T BUY A PAPERWHITE!!! They are deeply, intrinsically flawed in this version. I wish Voyages were still supported, and available. It had minor issues, mostly related to my personal preferences, but overall was a great edition. So maybe try an Oasis, though personally, I’m not sold on its shape. Personally, as others have mentioned, I want an e-reader, not a tablet. (I have a tablet, but I don’t like reading books on it.) My son has tried to convert me to Audible, but I tried it, didn’t like it. I may be forced to “read” with Audible eventually, though.Sorry for the length of this review. Thank you to those who’ve made it to the end! Good luck finding the right fit for you.",78 people found this helpful
"Kindle Paperwhite Signature Edition (32 GB) – With a 6.8"" display, wireless charging, and auto-adjusting front light – Without Lockscreen Ads – Black",4.0,"Almost perfect, but no page turn buttons","Reviewed in the United States on October 29, 2021",Color: Black | Option: Without Kindle Unlimited,True,"Let me start by saying this is my 4th overall Kindle e-reader, including owning the 4th generation Paperwhite and the Oasis 3rd generation. I have fallen in love with e-readers and reading again because of the Kindle line and this model is almost perfect.Starting with the screen, it is now 6.8”, up from 6” from the previous model. Personally, I liked the smaller form factor of the prior version, but with the bigger size, you do get more words per line. I don’t normally read books with lots of graphics, but I’m sure that would be an improvement as well. The one major feature that I loved on my Oasis was the warm lighting at night and now, that is available on the Paperwhite line. Great addition! The screen is the same 300 ppi as before and the text is sharp. Another addition to the Signature Paperwhite is an auto-brightness feature. Personally, I never used it on my Oasis and probably won’t on this one either. However, I have no complaints about the screen, it is near-perfect for an e-reader.Amazon finally updated the Kindles for USB-C charging! Personally, that should have been added in the previous generations, but it's here now. Finally, I don’t have to carry around an extra Micro USB cord just for my Kindle. In addition to that, the Signature Paperwhite also includes wireless charging. I first thought that feature was a bit hokey, but after using it on my iPhone and Kindle Fire HD 8”, it is nice to have, even if you don’t normally charge that way.One feature that Amazon really didn’t mention too much about was that they surely updated the processor in this model. It is fast, well, fast for an e-reader :) In my prior Paperwhite, sometimes I’d tap the screen for a page turn and nothing would happen, so I would tap it again, only to have it then turn 2 pages. The Paperwhite Signature Edition is very responsive and there is very little to no lag time, which is more like the Oasis line. Very nice!Personally, I much prefer the form factor of the Paperwhite over the Oasis’ asymmetrical design. I just never really liked it and although I don’t care that Amazon continues to sell them, I wanted to see a more premium version in the standard form factor, like the prior Kindle Voyage, since retired, and it here in the Paperwhite Signature Edition…ALMOST….There is one MAJOR issue I have and that is that Amazon didn’t include page turn buttons on this model. I of course knew this before purchasing, but nonetheless, I feel it deserves mentioning. I think that Amazon would have hit a home run out of the ballpark had they included page turn buttons, but apparently, they want to keep that feature (for now) on their premium Oasis line. And because Amazon choose to exclude page turn buttons, I only gave this model 4 stars.If you’re new to e-readers, although this is a fantastic option, if you don’t care about auto-brightness, wireless charging, or unless you absolutely need 32 GB of storage (most don’t for just regular books, audio books and graphics novels are an exception), consider the regular 11th generation Paperwhite. It’s $50 less and you still get the same large screen and warm lighting. Or better yet, while they are still available, get the 10th generation Paperwhite. As of this writing, I saw them on sale for $84.99, That’s a steal for that model.Finally, one gripe I have is that Amazon did not include the latest version of their Kindle software. I went to Amazons site to manually run the update and it is not listed there either. I have it on my Oasis and it is a nicer layout. I am sure it will be available at some point in the future, but it is perplexing that Amazon would create an update and then a month later, release a new Kindle without the ability to update it.Overall, I do recommend the Kindle Paperwhite Signature Edition, if you have a few extra bucks for the features. But they aren’t a must have to be honest, and for most people, the regular Paperwhite will be more than sufficient.UPDATE 11/5/2021The latest software update was released a couple of days ago and I was able to update it. I wanted to comment of a couple of other complaints people had. First, the fact that this is only available in wi-fi. Personally, I thought the 3G/4G models were a bit overkill. I mean, how hard is it to download a book at home before you leave? Or for that matter, find a wi-if hotspot somewhere? I think most people are not going to miss that feature, especially since it was a pricey upgrade anyway. Secondly, the fact the power button is on the bottom of the unit. This has been there for quite a few generations now and on the prior models I’ve owned. It personally has never been a problem for me. Yes, I’d prefer that it was on top, but I’ve never accidentally pressed it while reading. And on this new model, the button itself does require a bit of force to depress, so I really can’t see too many people hitting it by mistake and actually turning the device off. Finally with the screen, well, my prior comment stands. It really is nice. Not sure how some can feel it is a downgrade. The lighting is very uniform when reading at night and there are no dead spots. Furthermore, the contrast ratio seems higher, resulting in deeper blacks and whiter whites.",449 people found this helpful
"Kindle Paperwhite Signature Edition (32 GB) – With a 6.8"" display, wireless charging, and auto-adjusting front light – Without Lockscreen Ads – Black",4.0,As expected. Sorta. Battery talk.,"Reviewed in the United States on February 5, 2023",Color: Black | Option: Without Kindle Unlimited,True,"Works as expected except maybe the battery. I was an early adopter of readers back in the day but went back to books for years because I still think you can’t beat a physical book in hand. However, due to a number of reasons, I decided to give a reader a go again.It works as expected. However, I feel I need to talk about the battery because the advertising seems to lead people astray. I just got the low battery warning (10% life remaining). I’ve been using my Kindle for about 2 months for an avg 1-2 hrs every night. It also sat unused  for one month while I finished another book. I am not counting this month but it did drain the batter maybe 5% during that month. The only way I have gotten this much life is by not using the backlight (I use a clip on book light…this is my preference so it doesn’t feel as much like an electronic device) and keeping it on airplane mode except when purchasing/downloading a new book. I’ve downloaded 7 books. When done reading a book I also delete the download. When I have used the back light (for about an hour when my clip on light died), at less than half brightness level, the battery drained more quickly.Hope that is helpful for others. I too thought it would last longer since I do not use wifi much of the backlight. So if you do use those items do not expect 10 wks of life before recharge…. Unless something is wrong with my battery:)",4 people found this helpful

During that period my reading interest began to wane to the point I gave up. I didn't realize it at the time but the reason was that the tablet experience was not enjoyable. I recently started again with hard backs and it brought back my interest. A coworker recommend I try the Paperwhite. I was hesitant wondering how much different it could be from my 8"" tablet. With Amazon's return policy I figured I had nothing to lose. I can't explain it but the Paperwhite is vastly different from the tablet experience. At 6.8"" it's just small enough to not be obtrusive but big enough to read effectively. The screen is easy on the eyes and adjusts brightness automatically. My only quibble is that the power button is on the bottom. I hold my Paperwhite with the pinky finger under the device and it's happened where I've hit the button and turned it off. Horrible design decision and makes no sense when it could be placed out of the way on top. Outside of that issue the Paperwhite is a winner.",One person found this helpful

Flush screen, vertical orientation, plenty of storage, warm lighting (I've missed that feature since I retired my Kobo Aura One), and works with Calibre.

"Kindle Paperwhite Signature Edition (32 GB) – With a 6.8"" display, wireless charging, and auto-adjusting front light – Without Lockscreen Ads – Black",4.0,touchy touch screen,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on January 9, 2023",Color: Black | Option: Without Kindle Unlimited,True,"This is my 6th Kindle although Amazon has labeled it as my 4th.  My last Kindle (#5) purchased in 2019 works just fine.  I bought this because of wireless charging, how long the charge lasts and it is a teensy bit larger.  I read my Kindle for at least an hour every day.  I take it with me wherever I go.  I love my Kindle.  I have no idea why Amazon skipped a number between 3 and 5--and now made up for it in 2023.  This caused issues as the program still listed #5 as my default Kindle, rather than the new #4 Kindle.  At any rate --it has the same features pretty much as my 2019 Paperwhite except for the features mentioned.  The highly sensitive touch screen drives me crazy tho--the slightest, or accidental touch changes the page, sometimes more than one page and I have to figure out where I am.  There is an option to disable the touchscreen temporarily--- however you cannot get to anything else when you do that. You can however still read the book and turn pages by swiping.  It is easy to get the touchscreen back by quickly pressing the power button.  Since I specifically bought it in the bundle to get the compatible charger I am very disappointed that the charger will not arrive until mid March.  What is up with that?  By the way--the main reason I have bought so many is not because they went bad (well except for the first one) but because I wanted a different version.  Would I recommend it?  Yes if your first Kindle, or if your old Kindle is dying--or you want the extra bells and whistles.",7 people found this helpful

And also look at that warm light (warmth all the way up, same brightness on each).This new one reacts so much faster too, like it downloads books in like 2-3 secs and is so much faster at page turns. Also, I’ve had it for a week, charged it to 100% the day I got it and it’s only at 75% right now (and I read for hours a day). So the battery seems to be way better too.I’d definitely recommend upgrading to this one or purchasing it as a first time kindle owner, if you read a lot. I’m so happy with it. :)",7 people found this helpful

My favorites have been those that had page turn buttons with the Voyage being the best and Oasis after that. However, this device is the one I use the most these days. The display is almost great (still needs a little more contrast) and the battery life is great! The only issue I have is the bezel. With this form factor, the bezel is starting to get too small to hold it in one hand by the side without my thumb either accidently turning the page or leaving thumb prints.

I usually read my ebooks on my iPad. Reading on the iPad has always been hard on my eyes. I can only read for short period of time. I can read much longer on this which I really like. I also like that it is much smaller and easier to hold even with a cover. The other upside is that this is much more affordable than a tablet.The down sides are that it is definitely slower and not as intuitive to use as an iPad or phone.The other huge downside is the same for all digital books, I can’t write in the margins. I would love for someone to come up with a version that is affordable that would allow me to make notes in the margins. That might already exist and I just don’t know about it. That is what keeps me continuing to prefer a hard copy rather than an ebook most of the time.",

I like that the Kindle is much  better for my eyes which makes reading easier. I like the compact size and portability of the device.

I saw other complaints about this, and it can be annoying. If you're trying to read the kindle and set it on any surface, even a soft surface it can inadvertently be shut-off, or the pop-up asking you to confirm the shut down pops up.

"Kindle Paperwhite Signature Edition (32 GB) – With a 6.8"" display, wireless charging, and auto-adjusting front light – Without Lockscreen Ads – Black",3.0,A deeply-flawed UI drags this down (Updated),"Reviewed in the United States on August 23, 2022",Color: Black | Option: Without Kindle Unlimited,True,"My first Kindle was the 2nd edition with keyboard and joystick. I've owned many since, my favorite being the Voyage. When that one got a scratch on the screen, I decided it was time to upgrade and got the Signature Edition of the Paperwhite. While there are many good things about this model, the UI and certain policies by Amazon have drastically harmed the usability of this reader.First off, visibility of the screen is quite nice when reading. The ability to adjust the warmth of the light is very welcome. The slightly larger screen than the Voyage means more text can fit on the screen, though it does weigh a little more and is larger. You feel the difference in your hand when holding it for longer periods (which is usually the result of average reading sessions). Still, that's all expected when using something slightly larger. While reading, it's a very nice experience.That nice experience disappears outside of reading though. If you are more than a casual reader and have been building a library of ebooks, you'll find the experience very lacking, especially as you get older. There is a fact about growing older... your eyesight changes. Even if you don't need glasses for clarity, your ability to see contrast diminishes as you get older. Greyscale images are more difficult to read. The new UI lists books in a ""cover view"" where you see a grid of thumbnail images of the cover of the books in your library. Trying to read the titles of the books from a smaller greyscale image of the cover is difficult. A simple listing would be better. The UI does offer a simple listing, but when you choose to view your listing in this manner, you then see one long listing of all of the books on your kindle and do NOT see them grouped by Collections. The larger your library, the more books you have to scroll through. Collections in this view become worthless, forcing you to see your entire library. You have three different choices then, all of which are cumbersome. You can: 1) Scroll through a long listing of ALL of your books; 2) Scroll through just a Collection and see your books by images of their covers (harder to read with 55+ eyes); or 3) Keep switching views as you move in and out of collections. It's frustrating, and Amazon gives no way to offer feedback, forcing you to accept what they choose without comment.A recent decision by Amazon groups graphic novels and comics as part of your Kindle library. If you use their Comixology service to buy and read digital comics and graphic novels, then all of those are also listed in your Kindle library, even though reading material like that on an e-ink Kindle is probably the last thing you'll want to do. Most fans of graphic novels either read them on color devices where the artwork can be appreciated. You have to rely on filters to get rid of those listings.While many people may not consider the UI changes to be too impacting, the more books you have and the older you are increase the difficulty level. Having been buying books since the 2nd Edition Kindle, I have a library of over 1,500 books. That's a lot to sort through when I want to reread one, and my 62-year-old eyes don't handle the greyscale images well. It's a very unpleasant experience until I actually find the book and open it.On more thing... I suspect the wireless charger is somewhat temperamental. I have wireless charging pads in my home, and my phone (which is in a case) happily charges on them. The Kindle won't charge on any of them while it's in a case. Removing it from the case for charging is extremely cumbersome, so wireless charging is non-functional for me. The thickness of the case isn't any more than what's on my phone, so I suspect the kindle is fussier about being in closer contact with the pad, which is a shame.---Update 24/08/2022---I added an additional star to the review because I just received a phone call from the Kindle team regarding the issues I brought up in my review. We discussed them and the development team is being given a recording of all that I said so they can improve the UI experience (fingers crossed!). It's a good thing the team checks what's said in reviews and followis up with users who are unhappy, so I bumped up my review from two stars to three. I'll also modify the review and score to reflect future updates to the UI since it's only fair to rate the device on what the customer is going to receive when they buy one.",64 people found this helpful

I've had it for a bit now and thought this was a good time to write my review.Pros:-It's small but the text is easy to read and the screen works in all lights.-I love that it is just a reading device. No distractions. It is literally your kindle/audible library and the kindle store.-It's light weight and fits in my pockets. (As I wear women's clothes, it will not fit in women's jeans pockets but it will fit in sweaters, coats, and purse pockets.)-The dim light is amazing. I cannot go without it.-It says it can last a few months on only one charge but that is for someone that reads 30 minutes a day and who really only reads 30 minutes a day?!?! I read way more than that a day and have only charged it once since I got it. I've finished 5 books in that time and the battery is still going strong. That is something I could never do with my Kindle Fire or Ipad. I had to charge those daily. Absolutely love that battery life.Cons:-For almost $200 it lags a lot. None of the Kindle Fires ever lagged like this. So, I don't know why a device dedicated to being a reading device would be lagging so much.-The power button is on the bottom?!?! I've never hit it on accident like others have said, but it's just a strange placement. Especially because the Kindle Fire's power button is on top.-I do wish I could make my own lock screen. Not a deal breaker but still.-I'd also love it to be in color. Again, for $200, it should have color. The Kindle Fire is only like $50 and it has color...???In all honestly, I love the smallness of it and the battery life is fantastic. Anyone who reads a lot will definitely enjoy this.

"Kindle Paperwhite Signature Edition (32 GB) – With a 6.8"" display, wireless charging, and auto-adjusting front light – Without Lockscreen Ads – Black",3.0,First Time Kindle User. Pretty Good...but not Great.,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on June 8, 2022",Color: Black | Option: Without Kindle Unlimited,True,"I have been using e-ink eReaders for over a decade, all of them Barnes & Noble's NOOK eReaders. The Kindle is new to me. I was drawn to the Amazon Kindle because of multi-language support, dictionaries and Audible syncing. Here are my takeaways on why it's a pretty good but not great device:Pros:1. Languages - Kindles have multiple language dictionaries based on books you may download to your library. For me, that's the Japanese-English dictionary when reading! It has made reading my more difficult novels a breeze. Unfortunately, this doesn't include Turkic languages.2. Vocabulary Builder - This is a great tool for students as well as the avid reader who loves learning.3. Charging - The Signature Edition has wireless charging, which wasn't something I actually cared about, but I have used it nearly every day because it's very convenient and it works even with the Amazon Kindle cover.4. Cover - The Amazon Kindle fabric cover has magnets that keep the cover closed, so I don't need extra latches, straps or hooks. I also like that it wakes the device when I open it!5. Waterproof - Because life happens.6. Library Book Borrowing - The second best experience for borrowing eBooks from your local public library.Cons:1. Screen - The finish of the touch screen and black bezel are extremely prone to fingerprints. It makes already slightly fuzzy e-ink text more difficult to read. In comparison to a 2015 Nook GlowLight that also boasts 300 dpi, the text on the 2021 Kindle Paperwhite occasionally looks smudged when the frontlight is on. Compared to the 2021 Barnes & Noble Nook GlowLight 4, also with 300 dpi, the Kindle Paperwhite looks sharper with the frontlight on, but less clear when off because of the screen's propensity to smudge up. I clean the display every time before and after use, but since one must use the touch screen to use the device, it cannot be helped. Perhaps a screen protector is best advised for the 2021 Kindle Paperwhite?2. Current Software - The software versions 15.4.x are cluttered. Since updating to this version, I have had glitches of unresponsive screens or blank screens requiring me to restart the device. Keeping it in Airplane mode has alleviated this issue. If you want to use the device for Wi-Fi or Whispersync, too bad. Also, why is the ""From Your Library"" font different from the entire OS? It looks out of place.3. Home Screen Ads - After the 15.4 software update, the new design of the home screen is nearly 60% books advertised by Amazon. I avoid the home screen now. Clearly I have a different definition of what constitutes an advertisement than Amazon.4. Navigation - Compared to the Nook or Kobo eReaders, the Kindle Paperwhite 11th gen takes 2-3 taps for what I used to do in 1 tap. Examples: While reading a book, you want to go back to the library: tap screen at top middle to bring up the menu > tap Library (2 taps vs 1 tap on NOOK device-dedicated home button). Bookmarking on Kindle requires 2 or 3 taps depending--1 tap on Nook. While reading a book, turning on the frontlight can take an astounding FOUR taps (touch top of screen, select drop down menu, select brightness, tap outside the menu to close it and/or tap in little remaining space to return to book); all of this is done with 1 long press on the Nook home button or a 1 sliding gesture on Kobo devices.5. Side-loaded Books - I have purchased EPUB eBooks from multiple eBook sellers, so I have had to convert them to an Amazon-friendly format, which I do not mind at all. However, Amazon removes the covers of side-loaded books once you connect to Wi-Fi and restart the device. If you want to keep your personal library with book covers on Kindle, you'll need to use third-party software and/or stay off Wi-Fi.6. Amazon Household / Device Sharing - I thought I would be able to set up Profiles for everyone in the house on the Kindle, similar to how we have used our Nook devices together. Unfortunately, Amazon Household/adult-user setup is completely different. You cannot share a Kindle device in the family using Profiles to mark individuals' reading places, making these very expensive dedicated devices. 32GB is a great size to share a big library, especially manga/graphic novels, too bad I cannot make a Profile for everyone.",12 people found this helpful

I like the wireless charging.  I still wish there was a little more edge space to hold.  Holding the device without touching the screen can cause cramping.  Two changes I don't like.1.  On/off button on the bottom is inconvenient and I inadvertently hit it when I move my hand.  The recessed button on the top right was much better.2.  A setting in my old Kindle allowed me to show the current time in the upper left corner.  I can't find such a setting now.Overall, the Kindle is still a great reading device.",

"Kindle Paperwhite Signature Edition (32 GB) – With a 6.8"" display, wireless charging, and auto-adjusting front light – Without Lockscreen Ads – Black",4.0,"Not perfect, but pretty close.","Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on December 5, 2022",Color: Black | Option: Without Kindle Unlimited,True,"I want to start out by saying that I do enjoy this device very much, and it serves its intended purpose well. I've owned a few different iterations of the Paperwhite, and this one is definitely the most beautiful I've owned - after a returned unit due to dead pixels. The one I'm using, the replacement, still has weird pixels, but I live with it.Once you get past the tech nerd things, though, it's great. It's large by e-reader standards (I know the Scribe came out, and has a compelling value proposition, but man it's massive), is mostly uniformly lit, and runs VERY fast compared to previous generations. I have a few different iPads as well, and go to the Paperwhite for any text reading - it's just superior for that and shows the awesomeness of a single focused goal, in this case to replicate a book.This device will likely not be suitable for an all-rounder, however, and it makes no claims to that effect. It's nuclear-grade bookworm tech - all others need not apply.One last thing I want to highlight is that I've seen a lot of criticism of having both wireless charging and a USB C port on a device. Besides flexibility, it also provides redundancy. The charging port of a device is often the first thing to die - that addition makes this a ten year device instead of a five and is a killer addition.As far as drawbacks, really the only one is that Amazon still has a few issues to sort with their screens. It's not a perfect screen, and if you're looking you WILL find issues. Overall, though, it's far superior to the old ones, where you didn't have to look to find them.It's great, with some caveats.",10 people found this helpful
"Kindle Paperwhite Signature Edition (32 GB) – With a 6.8"" display, wireless charging, and auto-adjusting front light – Without Lockscreen Ads – Black",4.0,Almost identical in features to the regular Paperwhite,"Reviewed in the United States on December 24, 2022",Color: Black | Option: Without Kindle Unlimited,True,"I bought this Kindle Paperwhite Signature edition as part of a bundle and got a great deal. In fact, the whole bundle (with charging stand and case) cost less than the regular Paperwhite I purchased back in November ’21 when the the USB-C port finally came out. So I can’t be too critical of this new one, but when comparing them side-by-side, the only feature of value to me is the wireless charging. The other upgraded features are 32GB space vs. 8GB in the regular one which was more than adequate for my storage needs, and the auto-adjusting lighting, which honestly looks the same as my regular Paperwhite; I don’t notice a difference. They both have 17 LEDs with numerous lighting choices.So if you are not getting a bundle with the wireless charging stand and therefore will be charging this with a cable, and if 8GB space is adequate storage for you I would recommend the regular Paperwhite for the $35 savings.I still hate that major format update they did that changed everything we were used to, making what used to be simple complicated, adding unnecessary layers making it hard to find anything. After all this time I’m still not used to it and am impatiently waiting for some kind of new ‘smart’ instead of ‘stupid’ update. I was sure they would have rectified some of it, especially with all the complaints.",12 people found this helpful

I went with the Paperwhite Signature.PackagingThe packaging is very small, it’s just the Kindle and a charging cable.OnboardingWhen onboarding I was given two options - onboard on the device or via Amazon app, with a note indicating that the via app is faster. The screen told me what to do (open the app, go to this location and follow the flow. Onboarding took 5 minutes. I wasn’t confused at any point, I didn’t have any issues at all.

Very good onboarding.Device UsabilityAbout me—Age: 34Occupation: Tech industryThe Kindle itself is incredibly user friendly- I’ve never used an eReader but it gave me 5 helpful tips of what I can do and then set me free. I was able to setup everything how I wanted and download my content. Additionally, it’s very intuitive. It noticed me looking up words by highlighting them and offered me to download an add-on called Word Wise- which I’ve never heard of. It allows me to see definitions above words. I played with it a bit but didn’t like it, it seems mostly geared toward young readers… it defined unacceptable as not acceptable. Even on the lowest setting I still saw the words I knew defined so I decided to continue to look up words individually. I really hate the slowness and lag when scrolling, but I’m of the assumption this is to conserve battery… and maybe it’s because I have the battery saver on but I value the longer battery life over the fancy animations.ManualThe device doesn’t come with a paper owners manual, but it’s pretty easy to figure out most things… and the manual is in the device itself and you could also google the question (as was my choice).AccessoriesI already knew using the cable to charge the device was not going to be my preference, so I ordered the wireless charger made for it and it works fantastic.

"Kindle Paperwhite Signature Edition (32 GB) – With a 6.8"" display, wireless charging, and auto-adjusting front light – Without Lockscreen Ads – Black",5.0,Truly Converted Me,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on July 14, 2022",Color: Black | Option: Without Kindle Unlimited,True,"For many years I have been a staunch believer that physical books were the only proper way to enjoy my favorite books. For years my wife gently suggested a kindle, to stop the incoming tide of books piling up on shelves and even under the bed. Well I finally decided to give one a shot, and I could not be happier. The paperwhite does an excellent job of mimicking the look of a real page and I have not experienced any eye fatigue at all while reading. The Signature edition is worth the extra cost in my opinion for the additional storage space, but also the auto adjusting back light. I did not think that feature would make much of a difference to me but has quickly become one of my favorite features as it allows me to keep reading without stopping to adjust brightness when going from inside to outside or if the lighting changes in the room I am sitting in. At night the subtle glow of the Kindle Paperwhite helps me with not falling asleep while reading, usually a constant struggle for me, but doesn't leave me restless like looking at my phone does. The battery life is phenomenal. I have been using mine for 2 weeks and still have 60% battery life remaining on my original charge. I have changed my physical book buying habits to exclusively my favorites that I want to display and collect, but my everyday reading is now done almost exclusively on the Paperwhite. The ease of access to it and all the books in my Kindle library has increased the amount I am reading and that is the best reason I can think of to make the switch if you are unsure.A few minor gripes that I have found would be, the touchscreen, the kindle store specifically on the kindle, and graphic novels/comics. The touchscreen isn't unresponsive, but occasionally it doesn't pick up my swipes the first input. Not regular enough to even be an annoyance honestly, but worth mentioning. I do not recommend navigating the kindle store on the Kindle Paperwhite. The kindle is not designed with browsing the store in mind, and as such is slow and downright clunky. Fortunately there is a simple solution, browse the kindle store on your phone then just hit send to kindle. It's super easy to do and your Kindle will start downloading automatically once it has access to Wifi. I typically browse on my phone for a new book while taking a break at work, and when I pick up my Kindle when I'm ready to read the book is already downloaded and waiting. Lastly, I would not recommend using the Paperwhite to read graphic novels/comics personally. Everything is obviously in black and white so you aren't getting the full impact of the illustrations. This one is more up to personal preference but I would prefer to read these in full color.To summarize my rambling; If you are considering making the switch to an e-reader, the Kindle Paperwhite should absolutely be your first choice. Excellent battery life, convenience, and ease of access that has revolutionized my daily reading habits.",33 people found this helpful
"Kindle Paperwhite Signature Edition (32 GB) – With a 6.8"" display, wireless charging, and auto-adjusting front light – Without Lockscreen Ads – Black",4.0,Great Reading Device,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on October 6, 2022",Color: Black | Option: Without Kindle Unlimited,True,"First time kindle buyer here! So let’s start with the good. The device itself is a really good size. It’s compact and light yet sturdy and pretty well made. The lighting/coloration is very easy on the eyes and doesn’t contrast harshly (something I was worried about with trying to read electronically versus a physical book). I’m quickly running out of room for bookshelves, so this gives me the option of purchasing physical copies of series that I really loved later down the road. I was extremely surprised at how quickly the titles downloaded. I live in a super rural area with slow (10ish mbps download speed via satellite) wifi. So taking this device on the go will be super easy and quick. Let’s also not forget about the price differences between kindle options and physical copies!Now, on to the “other”. I won’t say bad… yet. I’m still super new to this, so it might just be a user-adjustment period. I have noticed what I originally thought was a screen-change glitch. Specifically, when in the store screen selecting a title or opening a book. After doing a bit more research, it seems like this is a normal thing that happens with most (if not all) kindles. Again, not a terrible thing. There is some lag with the touch screen, but it’s neither a bad nor good thing. It’s just there, so be patient when selecting! I also had to use google a bit to figure out how to navigate the screens, turn pages, and power options. The device came with little to no instructions for use other than the initial set-up process. After a quick search, functionality is simple. Careful of the right side of the screen! The scroll bar feature can be a little bit of an issue initially. It’s not a smooth scroll like with a smart phone or computer; there’s  more of a solid block/screen/page scroll. Last, and likely most important, is battery life. I’ve seen mention of the batter life supposedly supporting several hours of not days of reading. It came with 57% and by the end of set up (maybe thirty minutes including figuring out unlimited vs. purchase) it was showing 53%. So the jury is still out on that portion.All things combined, this is a nice device that I will for sure get a good amount of use from.",14 people found this helpful
"Kindle Paperwhite Signature Edition (32 GB) – With a 6.8"" display, wireless charging, and auto-adjusting front light – Without Lockscreen Ads – Black",3.0,Knocking this down another star,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on August 27, 2022",Color: Black | Option: Without Kindle Unlimited,True,"This is an update from my original review.  Having heavily used my new Paperwhite for a couple of weeks now, I'm knocking this down to 3 stars since there are at least couple issues that are growing quite negatively on me.First, they REALLY need to fix the wake-on-cover-open feature with a setting to turn this function off.  I like that the magnet helps keep the cover closed, but I shouldn't have to buy another expensive cover without a magnet to avoid the annoying wake-on-open function.  I raised this issue in my original review, and the more I use the Kindle, the more I hate this ""feature.""  Assuming the hardware is designed properly, please release a firmware update to allow the user to turn this function ON or OFF.Second, I shouldn't have put up with a menu to rate every single document when I reach the end.  There must be an option in Settings to turn this OFF.  Also, when I ""X-out"" of the ratings page the whole page turns blank, then I need to tap the top to get a menu back and then tap again to get back to my library.  REALLY?!!  Who wrote the GUI requirements for the firmware?  Let me guess:  Must have been someone in Sales or Marketing :-(Original Review:  This is my 2nd e-Ink Kindle.  My first is a 3G/WiFi/Keyboard type from 2010.  While it's still in excellent shape and even has the original battery, cellular companies bailed from their 3G support a while ago, and sadly, just recently Amazon stopped supporting the Shop feature of this old unit, even on WiFi.  I'm holding onto it as a backup, as I can always upload docs via my computer, but since I do so much reading I decided to break down and buy the Paperwhite Signature edition bundle, which included a leather cover and wireless charging dock.I'm so used to my older keyboard-style Kindle that I was a little apprehensive switching to a touchcreen, but I was pleasantly surprised at the relative ease of navigation. Overall there is a lot to like about the new Signature edition, and I would have rated it at 5 stars, save for a few small annoyances:1. There must be a way to turn off the wake-on-open feature, triggered by the magnet within the front cover.  I realize some covers do not have a magnet and therefore won't trigger the wake function upon opening, but one should be able to enable/disable this feature in the Settings menu.  I like the magnet, as it helps keep the cover closed, but I don't always want the Kindle to wake up when opened.2. I am so used to the paging buttons on my old Kindle, I REALLY miss them!  One needs to be careful swiping left or right via the touchscreen, as sometimes a page may be skipped over.  As I get used to the touchscreen this seems to be occurring less often.  Not sure if a ""Swipe Sensitivity"" setting would help here or not, but may be a feature worth adding in the Settings menu.3. The power button on the bottom edge should be a slider-type, definitely NOT a push button!  My old Kindle has a spring-loaded slider along the bottom edge, with a fairly long throw, so I have never accidentally triggered it (at least that I can recall, that is).4. I would like to see a bit more control by the user on exactly what is displayed on the Home screen.  While I purchased the add-free version, I am a minimalist and do not want to see recommended books or a lot of clutter unless I turn this feature on.  Perhaps there is a way to customize the Home screen and turn this feature off but I simply haven't figured it out yet, so this review may be updated at a later time.",22 people found this helpful

I am currently in the process of returning this Kindle paperwhite signature edition... and it is literally taking weeks to process.  I am unsure why... esp since I am hoping to get another Kindle... maybe NOT the signature since it has been known to have issues and I sure experienced that.  From flashing on an entire page, to a bright circle spot literally 2in in diameter in the center making it impossible to read... to freezing... this was a NEW kindle on days after receiving it.  I have spent more time waiting to get this returned and refunded (literally almost 3 weeks) and I keep getting the 3-5 days to process a credit (they admit they have received in 2 weeks ago)??!?  Well maybe this is more about the service part than the actual product... but the Kindle definitely had problems.  I am chalking it up to a bad batch so be prepared for the luck of the draw when you order yours.  Again, the older kindles (i.e. the ones are now with limited support) never had this problem.  I never thought I would be saying Frustration and Kindle in the same sentence.Amended 9/26/22After receiving a very nice call from customer support inquiring about the issue and seeing that all I stated was true about the issues and mix-up in the return which was chronicled in the call logs... I got a new Kindle delivered this last Saturday (9/24).  The issues were chalked up to bad goof by Amazon and some customer support agents that were ah... not thinking through the big picture, etc.  This customer agent was way better equipped in so many ways... from what she could do to how she acted and stated things... I wish all my interactions were done through her... she was FANTASTIC.  This is what I had come to expect from Amazon... so for my case... this was resolved since my new Kindle is working fine.  My faith in Amazon's customer service was restored.  4 out 5 stars... 1 star down due to the hardware/software issue experienced... but still super respectable and definitely recommended.

I am the type of person who reads books and tries to keep them in mint condition. I never write on them and try to never bend pages.For me the kindle is way better because I can't harm the book itself and notes I make on the book don't require me to write/change the book itself in any way.Getting books in the kindle:On the other hand. You can get virtually any book really easily just by emailing the files!And books on the kindle store are almost always way cheaper than phisical versions.Goodreads:It integrates with GoodReads so I can share what I am reading, update how far I am in books, rate the books and even share my favorite lines on books.Software:The software is intuitive enough where it took me about 20 minutes of tinkering with settings and now I am an expert on it. Swiping animations feel good and I have never had an issue where I do something with the kindle that I didn't intend.Battery life:My kindle has dropped from 100 to 82% battery in 10 days. Can't say I read all the time but I have used it every single day at least half an hour. At this rate I might just charge it once or twice a month.Accesories?A folding case is a no brainer for me. It locks and unlocks the kindle when you open or close it. It's sad that if you use this you won't see the cover of the book while the kindle is blocked, but not a deal breaker. I'd rather keep my kindle protected.This kindle supports wireless charging. Altho on my opinion this is NOT needed and I regret having spent more money on the stand for wireless charging by Anker. Having the stand to charge it wireless feels unneccesary since I would only have to charge the device once or twice a month.I'm in love and I will never go back to phisical books unless absolutely neccesary.",29 people found this helpful

"Kindle Paperwhite Signature Edition (32 GB) – With a 6.8"" display, wireless charging, and auto-adjusting front light – Without Lockscreen Ads – Black",5.0,The best Kindle E-reader you can buy right now,"Reviewed in the United States on October 25, 2022",Color: Black | Option: Without Kindle Unlimited,True,"I bought this for my wife as an early Christmas gift. I have owned a Kindle Paperwhite for a few years, a 7th Generation model to be exact, but she has always used a Kindle Fire 7 for reading ebooks. She has been having a harder time sleeping and I thought it would be a good idea to reduce the eye strain she gets when reading at night by replacing her Kindle Fire. So far, it's a hit. The new Dark Mode and Warm Light Mode are the stand outs for her, and have made it much easier on her eyes in the evenings. Comparing it to my own Paperwhite, the new, larger screen is a huge improvement, and the way it lays flush with the rest of the device it extremely nice. Hopefully we won't have to test how waterproof it is, but I'm less nervous about getting caught in the rain with it than I would be with my older model. The real standout here is the USB-C charging port, and the wireless charging. Both our phones use USB-C, my Nintendo Switch Oled uses it, my headphones use it. We also have a portable battery bank with a built in wireless charger. All of this makes it easier to travel with the Paperwhite Signature edition than any other model of Kindle. The battery life is indeed long, but needing to charge in a pinch is much easier than with my older Kindle. I don't always have a Micro-USB cable with me and it's easier to not have to worry about needing one. I'd highly recommend this model if you're shopping for a new Kindle. I looked at all other currently available (Oct 2022) Kindle Models and this one, at least for now, stands far above the rest.",12 people found this helpful

If you already have a tablet, there is not much reason to buy a Kindle. - screen, text quality: ipad is 200% better. The fonts are much sharper and the screen estate matters. Reading on 7 inch screen is ridiculous. - performance/sluggishness: kindle used to be a lot slower, yes it’s much better now but ipad is at least 4 times faster. - interface/UI: Kindle app interface could be better, but at least it’s better than the actual Kindle. The actual Kindle UI is back to 1980. - immersion reading: this means the audible is sync’d with the pages. It only works on Kindle apps, not on actual Kindle. This is the deal breaker for me. If this worked, I would have kept the Kindle for all its shortcomings. - weight: this is the only pro of the actual Kindle. Much easier on the hand. Contradicting my first bullet point about the screen size, 7 inch is a perfect size to put down in your coat pocket. As a transportable reading device, Kindle paperwhite is a perfect. - eye health: people say the actual Kindle is easier on eye. Personally, I can see why but need to test a bit more on this. I use greenish background on my ipad, which is surprisingly easy on eyes.So, here is my personal opinion. I read so many amazing reviews on Kindle, so I felt the need to balance it out a bit. I preordered Kindle Scribe, so I hope it will be better.",16 people found this helpful

I was content with the item I had, but after switching, I am much more pleased with the signature. It has a much more responsive screen time when trying to turn a page, and doesn't seem to be as glitchy. It also loads and operates more quickly. The signature has more heft and bulk than my older kindle, but isn't a deal breaker, because it's easier to hold because there is more space on the bottom to grasp comfortably.I like the auto on/off when I open the cover. I got the no-ad version, which I do like better because when the kindle wakes up, it goes straight to the page I last left, instead of having to swipe and click on things to get to my book.The battery is AMAZING!! I've been reading on this kindle for 2 weeks, and it had 49% battery life right out of the box. I have read an incredible amount of hours, at least 35-40 hours, and my battery finally hit the 10% warning.I wish I had an option to look at reading stats directly from my kindle. I went to the app on my phone to look over stats and reading achievements. In addition to days/weeks read, I would like to keep track of how many hours I'm reading a day, week, month kind of like on my audible account. I wouldn't mind also being able to review the books I've read straight from my kindle device. None of this really takes away from the review, but are things I think woild improve my kindle experience.",33 people found this helpful

I started with regular kindle and moved up to Kindle Paperwhite when they brought it out.  This Paperwhite Signature is the best I have had!1.  NO ADS! I love not having ads, all my previous Kindles have had the ads.  I should have gone ad free years ago!2.  The 6.8"" screen and the pixels per inch make a huge difference to my old eyes at a smaller font size than my previous 2018 paperwhite.  The screen seems much clearer, which is probably the combo of the larger screen, better lighting, and higher ppi.  I didn't think it would make a big difference, but its huge for me!3. This should probably be with #2 but it deserves its own point.  I have always had trouble looking through the store or library on previous Kindles due to the pictures/title of the covers being so hard to read in B&W.  I would use my PC or tablet to find the books I wanted and send them to the Kindle.  Not so with the Paperwhite signature!  I can easily navigate the store or library, even without my glasses!  I still hate that I can't choose the payment method and it defaults to my Amazon gift card when buying kindle books.4.  The touch screen is more responsive than my previous 2018 kindle paperwhite.  Much more!5.  The dark mode is much better with the Kindles Paperwhite Signature, much better.6. Battery life:  I've only had it for 2 weeks at the time of writing this review, but I have only charged it once and it's still at 83% and that's after reading about 1-3 hours per day.

Although I will say that battery life seems to be about what I've typically experienced with the Kindle Oasis, without leaving the WiFi connected and only reading for about 10-30 minutes each day and night, before my Oasis got old that is. I'd downgraded back to your basic Kindle after my Kindle Oasis died, but missed the additional storage of some of the more advanced/enhanced Kindles, but didn't really want another Oasis just yet , as this one was on sale, I decided to try this one, and so far I love it.

The Amazon Kindle team has absolutely killed it with this device. It's fast, the battery life is amazing and most importantly it has an auto adjusting backlight. I liked this kindle so much, I bought one for myself after getting one for someone else as a Christmas present.Another nice move from the Amazon Kindle team was when I started the device. There are a few prompt questions but because I bought it from my Amazon account, it was already logged in and on my wif. I simply had to download the books and start reading.The text that appears on screen is so crisp. Occasionally I notice when you change pages that the text from the previous page stays there a bit, but that may be a function of all e-ink displays.Overall this device is just amazing. iPads, iPhones etc. can't compete with this screen for reading books. It's absolutely worth the money if you want the best reading experience in the world.",6 people found this helpful
"Kindle Paperwhite Signature Edition (32 GB) – With a 6.8"" display, wireless charging, and auto-adjusting front light – Without Lockscreen Ads – Black",4.0,Very nice but no cigar!,"Reviewed in the United States on July 25, 2022",Color: Black | Option: Without Kindle Unlimited,True,"Am in my second week of using my new Paperwhite Kindle. This is my fourth, having been through the Keyboard, the Touch, the Voyage and now the Paperwhite. Positives are it is clearer, perhaps easier to read because it is a bit sharper, charges wirelessly and has finally upgraded to the newer type C mini usb charging plug (yeah!). I am not thrilled with the software as opposed to my Kindle Voyage. I am big on having collections so I can put all unread books into an 'UNREAD' collection and I am very big on lists of books. I do not like the 'Grid' concept nor do I want to see covers. The Paperwhite does have a collections function but when it is used you lose the ability to sort by Title or by author. In all past versions I have used when you had a collection it was still sorted by author. In the Paperwhite that capability is no longer available. I strongly urge Amazon to add that function to a upcoming software change. The wireless charging dock works well and charges through the leather cover I purchased. The Paperwhite comes with a port that takes the mini usb C type charging plug/receptacle. Same as my Samsung S20FE phone so it is one less cord to travel with. Battery life appears good. Have been using about 1 hour per day for last 10 days and still has over 60% capacity.Along with the Paperwhite I purchased the wireless charging dock and because quite a few reviewers said the Amazon cover was poor quality I purchased the CoBak cover with stand and holding strap. High quality and real leather. Also has an inside spot to hold 1 or 2 credit card size items. Appears to work well as I dropped the Paperwhite and watched it bounce down my stairs. The Paperwhite came through fine but suggest you not try this on yours. I am not upset with the on button. Seems to work based on time. Have not measured but think after 6 or more hours the Paperwhite turns itself off and you must use the button to turn back on. Pressing left or right margins of pages causes the Paperwhite to go to the next or previous page. Fonts are selectable. Font size is selectable. Warmth and light intensity are also selectable.Software issues aside this was a good purchase. Every Kindle seems to have new 'quirks' and I am sure I will get over the loss of by author sorting when I am in Collections mode. That is the main reason I am rating 4 rather than 5.",5 people found this helpful

It is actually still going strong. Holds a charge for weeks still.I didn’t need a new one.I’m still glad that I upgraded.Wireless charging and usb c are amazing upgrades. I always felt like the micro usb was fragile on the pw2 though there was no evidence of that after 10 years of service.The backlight is beautiful. I love the warm light because I mostly read at night.The UI is so much more responsive. That’s probably due to a better processor over the years but it is absolutely noticeable.The flush glass screen feels so sophisticated. I love the way the cover snaps in with magnets to protect the glass.Really best of breed for focused devices.I hope that I get another 10 years out of this learning companion.,

"Kindle Paperwhite Signature Edition (32 GB) – With a 6.8"" display, wireless charging, and auto-adjusting front light – Without Lockscreen Ads – Black",2.0,"Nice Hardware, Software May Be Problematic","Reviewed in the United States on October 18, 2022",Color: Black | Option: Without Kindle Unlimited,True,"I am a long-time Kindle user. I have loved every single Kindle I have purchased. My new Kindle may be the only one I don’t love which is disappointing – and it’s not the hardware that’s disappointing. I love the 17 LEDs, the additional warm lighting, and the slightly larger screen size. For the most part I find the default options are fine.About me: I have a very large library (5000+ books) and I always read off-line. And I prefer to have all my books (or at least as many as will fit!) downloaded on my device. I have organized my books into 36 collections (makes it easier to find a specific book…at least for me).I have been using a Kindle since the original keyboard so have been through several software upgrades. This is usually a seamless process. Unfortunately, I’ve had nothing but problems with this one.To begin with – I loved how it was already linked to my Amazon account. All my books were already listed on the device and just needed to be downloaded. I was happy – while time-consuming this isn’t difficult.First, I installed the software update that was waiting to be installed. Then I set about downloading my books onto the device. This is when I noticed that a number of books had been downloaded two or three times. I could not delete these phantom books.I did some research and discovered that some people had experienced the same problem with the 2018 Kindle and had resolved the issue by doing a factory reset. So, I did a factory reset. This significantly reduced the number of phantom books in my library. I still wasn’t entirely happy but could live with it.Two days later, after having spent hours downloading books, I was ready to start reading. While scrolling through my collections my Kindle froze and gave me an unexpected error message and the option(s) to deregister my Kindle, do a factory reset, or contact the support team. I opted for another factory reset.The second factory reset eliminated some more of the phantom books, but I also noticed that books I had purchased and downloaded were disappearing from the list of books on my device very shortly after I downloaded them. Some of the disappeared books simply moved to the end of the list of books by that author and some disappeared entirely. A few other books don’t seem to download at all.Based on the reviews, my problem seems to be an aberration. Right now, I’m frustrated. If I hadn’t traded in my Kindle when I purchased this one, I’d simply return the Signature edition and call it quits.I still strongly recommend a Kindle but perhaps not the Signature edition**********************************************************************************************************************Updated October 25, 2022I finally got all of my books loaded onto this Kindle. The number of duplicate entries (not duplicate purchases) did get drastically reduced after I did the second factory reset. A week later I actually got to begin reading a book on the Kindle.A really interesting book. I charged the Kindle last night and it was at 100%. Unplugged it from the charger and put it on my coffee table preparatory to finishing the book. Picked it up an hour later and it was showing an 88% charge. I thought that was odd but maybe my non-Amazon case wasn't properly shut.  Finished reading the book (noticed when I closed the cover a few times that the book cover was not displaying when I opened the case which I thought was odd but wasn't too concerned about).Wanted to return the book to the library. That's when the Kindle told me that it couldn't find the book in my library. There were no books in my library according to the screen I was on. So decided to change my view to listing the books and according to the statistics it showed 4000+ books were loaded on the Kindle. But I still couldn't find any books on the Kindle nor could I open any of my collections.So I restarted the Kindle. Once that process was completed all of my books had reappeared and the battery showed a 94% charge.I've done more factory resets on this version of the Kindle than I have ever done on any of my previous Kindles (I normally only need to do this when I get rid of an older Kindle). And I've done more restarts on this Kindle than on any of my previous Kindles (usually only did then when there was a software upgrade).I don't know what's going on but I am definitely not impressed and wish I hadn't decided to upgrade to the new Kindle.",11 people found this helpful

I also enjoy that the Signature Edition, has the auto adjusting light. It comes in handy if you are reading and walking from low light into bright light or vice versa.Many have speculated on whether it is worth the extra few dollars to buy the Signature Edition, I would reply, without a doubt.There is so much to review with this device that I have decided to just stick with the basic’s, I love itThere are features, such as font style, size, boldness, that I really enjoy. You can choose the brightness and warmth of the screen, with enough variations to fit almost any eye pleasure.This Kindle does have a rudimentary web browser, that I found makes it much easier to download books directly from Project Gutenberg to the device. If you belong to a library, you can load books from the library to your Kindle, with easeThey say the Signature Edition will hold well over 10,000 books, which works for me.If I had to find a negative, it would be the slight delay while scrolling, and the on, off button being on the bottom, but neither is a game changer, just slightly inconvenient at times.I have taken this Kindle to a number of appointments, making wait times disappear, into roads of adventureBottom line, if you love reading, and are not wanting to build a wall library, this will enhance that experience greatly, well worth the price",13 people found this helpful

Finally bought myself a Paperwhite and LOVE it! For years I resisted e-books I was the last person that would ever convert from paper to an electronic device. However during Covid 2020 and beyond I made the switch to the dark side, and had fallen in love with reading on my iPad. For various reasons I find it easier to read some sort of device. Recently I began to look at a Paperwhite, bought this version and suddenly feel like I have wasted so much time ! Reading on this is smooth, the touch screen is very responsive ,I find myself able to read much faster , for longer periods of time and more often. This little device goes everywhere with me now is extremely lightweight much smaller than I was used to with my iPad , surprisingly  this has not been a problem , actually prefer this size since it will fit in any bag or purse I carry . Battery life is amazing !! I have not had to charge it yet and I have owned it approximately three weeks! I read daily even if only for a few minutes but find that because of the adjustments I can make to the font size and the back lighting I have literally no eye strain. This has increased the length of time I can read , especially at night or in low lighting. I have not been able to test it outside , in the sun yet. That will be the final test for me. I love that I can carry my entire digital library with me pretty much anywhere I go. Five stars , I would give it 10 if it if I could so convenient and fun! Don’t waste your time looking at all these reviews researching and wasting all that time when you could be reading. Just do yourself a kindness and buy yourself a fun little Paperwhite ! it is well worth the money.  I have nothing negative to say about it ! Extremely happy with my new toy! And get yourself a cute cover, makes it much easier to hold onto. This leaves you with only one more question…“What should I read next ?”",11 people found this helpful

"Kindle Paperwhite Signature Edition (32 GB) – With a 6.8"" display, wireless charging, and auto-adjusting front light – Without Lockscreen Ads – Black",5.0,It's Great,"Reviewed in the United States on October 10, 2022",Color: Black | Option: Without Kindle Unlimited,True,I ordered a Signature Edition Essentials package of Kindle and received it about 3 days ago. After letting it charge up I got on and was able to hook into my iPhone for set up. It was so easy I could hardly believe it. I had anticipated a different setup after reading reviews for this Kindle. I am delighted to see that I can have my books in collections and have the collections alphabetized for easy search of what I want to read. This Kindle is a Generation 11 which apparently was my old one that has the same setup.  I do not particularly like the amber light that you can set with the regular light. But you don't have to use the amber light if you don't want. It can be turned off which is what I have done. I did not particularly want the wireless charger as I did not want another thing to find space to set it but the charger worked fine. I have been reading my new Kindle the last 2 days and have yet to recharge it. I read 2-6 hours every day.  I also want to add here comments about the Amazon leather cover that came with this set. The cover is not leather but plastic. It has a cover that when closed will shut off the KIndle and I believe this is why I have yet to recharge the battery. The cover is very well made. I wanted a cover that could be wiped off as I sometimes eat while I read and this cover allows you to do that. I spent way more money than I intended but so far it has been worth it.,8 people found this helpful

The new features in this Kindle, namely wireless charging and waterproofing, convinced me to part with my beloved Voyage. And most of the time, I’m really happy I did. The new kindle has a bigger screen, it’s much faster, and while it’s annoying to move your thumb to change pages (you could change pages on the voyage without any hand movement) it’s not horrible.What _is_ horrible is the power button on the bottom. Who the heck though this was a good design decision? If I’m not accidentally pushing it with one of my knuckles holding the book, I’m pushing it with my belt buckle because I had the gall to place the device on my lap while lying down. I’ve lost count of the number of times I’ve had to wait for the book to reboot because of the stupid power button on the bottom.Come on Amazon, I know putting the button close to where the logic board is situated is cheaper, but this isn’t a cheap device. I suspect you can absorb the few cents it costs to relocate the power button to the side or top. I’d go for the top, personally, very little chance of hitting it accidentally there.Other than the power button, a very solid entry in the Kindle line. I wish they’d release an update of the Voyage that can be used without moving your hand, but barring that, I’ll definitely keep this one.",6 people found this helpful

"Kindle Paperwhite Signature Edition (32 GB) – With a 6.8"" display, wireless charging, and auto-adjusting front light – Without Lockscreen Ads – Black",5.0,(Almost) The Best Kindle Ever,"Reviewed in the United States on August 8, 2022",Color: Black | Option: Without Kindle Unlimited,True,"My Kindle Voyage did not survive being laundered. Yes, it was caught up in the bedsheets. Too bad; that was IMO the best of all the Kindles in its time. But never mind, the Voyage is history.The new Paperwhite finally makes up for the shortcomings of its predecessors, by incorporating most of the best features of the best versions of each. It lacks only physical page-turn buttons, which is something I, at least can easily live without.From the Oasis it has the larger screen, the color-temperature adjustment, the auto-brightness. It did not, thankfully, retain the terrible battery life, the reason I traded my Oasis in.From the Voyage it has the absolutely perfectly even screen lighting.The regular version has the reasonable price of previous Paperwhites, and USB-C; the Signature adds the lack of ads and the extra storage for audiobooks.All it lacks is the feather lightness of the Voyage; the new Kindle is a handful. But add a hand-strap, or a case with a strap, and you'll never care about the weight.The battery life is prodigious. Have I mentioned that already? I've owned Keyboards, Basics, Paperwhites, Oases, Voyages, and this new Paperwhite beats them all. It seems like the battery level barely creeps downward.The software is pretty much the same across all my recent Kindles, and it's fine. Different people quibble about different features, and that's OK, but with some study you can usually figure out how to make it do what you want. It's more than fine, and compared to earlier Kindles it's sort of a miracle.The lack of cellular connectivity is a non-issue, IMO. Yes, if you don't have a phone that can provide a wifi hotspot, or you live in a wifi desert, or you don't have a computer, then maybe it's a problem. Or maybe your lack of connectivity in general is more of a problem. But cellular has always been the least-used method of getting books onto Kindles, so I can't criticize Amazon for no longer providing it for free.Meanwhile, my new Paperwhite Signature is scratching all my itches. My wife, who complains about everything, loves hers too.",14 people found this helpful

"Kindle Paperwhite Signature Edition (32 GB) – With a 6.8"" display, wireless charging, and auto-adjusting front light – Without Lockscreen Ads – Black",3.0,"An avid upgrade for the tech-lover, a nuance for the hardcore reader","Reviewed in the United States on November 25, 2022",Color: Black | Option: Without Kindle Unlimited,True,"I typically read 100-200 pages on a kindle paper white (2018) daily. I purchased this kindle with the phenomenal pricing on Black Friday. As the title reads, this is a massive tech upgrade from kindles as old as 4 years past. To my disappointment, the reading experience is the same to slightly less enjoyable.The very first thing I noticed from the moment my delivery woman handed me the package was that “this is heavy!” I knew I had to account for packaging and the box the kindle ships in (not the cardboard box, the protective device sleeve) but was still surprised as this was my knee-jerk reaction.The kindle came in mint condition and looked… well just like a kindle. Unboxing and holding the device independent of its packaging yielded the same reaction: it felt noticeably heavier than my old paperwhite.Powering up, the kindle arrived with 52% battery; which is no concern because it would certainly last all day. Setup up was LIGHTYEARS faster than my old paperweight. No lag when typing, web pages load mimicking a cellphone, settings change immediately, books open as fast as their physical counterparts.I immediately went after exploring the new features: warm lighting and dark mode- both which were encouraging factors for me to buy the upgraded paperwhite as apposed to the normal kindle-kindle.Both seems cool, but I can hardly imagine being in a position where I say “I need to use these features!” The actual reading experience isn’t largely impacted by use of either. I can imagine dark mode would be helpful if you’re reading in a pitched black room, but the warm lighting really didn’t seem to make a large impact. Books still put me to sleep if I’m tired with warm lighting or not.Now I consider myself more of a reader than someone who is obsessed with new features, and I’m disappointed to report that the new paperwhite is not any easier to read on, and may well be more difficult. Pages look great, display is crisp, but I cannot read with just one hand. For your own anyaltics, I’m a young man who wears a medium in medical gloves- the only way I could enjoy this e-reader with one hand was if I rested the weight of the kindle on my chest or a stand. I could not comfortably read on my back holding the device with one hand.In conclusion I think I will downgrade to the new and lighter/smaller kindle e-reader.  The new features on this kindle are cool, but not necessary of a upgrade just for their sake. If you read with two hands or prefer a large screen, you’ll probably love this device. In my case this e-reader does not create a comfortable enough reading experience and I will be seeking a more compact version.",9 people found this helpful
"Kindle Paperwhite Signature Edition (32 GB) – With a 6.8"" display, wireless charging, and auto-adjusting front light – Without Lockscreen Ads – Black",3.0,Kindle Signature Paperwhite does not permit audiobooks from sources other than Amazon!,"Reviewed in the United States on January 30, 2023",Color: Black | Option: Without Kindle Unlimited,True,"I have been debating with myself about whether to return this Kindle Signature Paperwhite. I like the screen for reading but I also want to hear audiobooks.I'm very disappointed moving already owned or borrowed public library audiobooks from a laptop to the Kindle Signature Paperwhite is not possible due to Kindle imposed restrictions. This Kindle can play audiobooks but only if you acquire the audiobook through Amazon; this requires buying the expensive monthly Audible Subscription. This is unacceptable for me.I own audiobooks that I want to keep with all my ebooks, all in one place. One of reasons for getting a Kindle is to keep all my books in one place.I've paid for the hardware/software that's not fully useful unless the proprietary audible subscription is purchased. Yet if the digital book (not audio) is acquired from a library, say from Overdrive or Libby, it can be loaded into the Kindle. The inability to transfer my own audiobooks to my Kindle (unless they came from Kindle) is exceptionally disappointing.Using the Kindle app on my Apple laptop, I can acquire both audio and digital books without barriers, including public library sourced items.I initially found the screen difficult to navigate because I couldn't find a map of all options to quickly get the screen I needed. Scrolling up and down, looking for certain hidden pages (like the settings tab), was frustrating. I think I have figured it out but not without pain. The instructions from Amazon chat service people proved difficult. Their help assumes you have signed up for Audible and/or Kindle Unlimited so you can navigate through those services.I wish someone at Amazon Kindle would contact me and share a work around.

I knew that I could use the Kindle app on ALL of the phones I've ever owned and on all of the tablets I've had, but something was missing. This is it. This is the one. And I'll never go back. With a great deal through Amazon Warehouse, I'm ready for full digital conversion.First, It's ridiculously light. Deceivingly so. Adding the leather cover gave me more of the feeling of the weight of a book. It also lets me grip it a little better without oily fingerprints getting on the back. Now that I have this, it feels good in the hand. Previously reading in bed was weird. Either the screen was too small or too large and heavy. This feels like I can read until I go t sleep and not worry about rolling over and breaking it. It feels sturdy.I also was able to get all of my DRM free books onto it easily either through drag and drop or through emailing them.And this screen. It's the best part. Paperwhite indeed. It is exactly like reading paper. Once I get the fot and size right, it'll be perfect, but right now, I'm loving it.What do I wish? I wish it had a headphone jack, although I didn't check to see it my USB C ones would work. I'd like to NOT use by Bluetooth headphones for audible books. But other that, my only issue is having 200 books on hand right now, I don't know what to read.",22 people found this helpful

I am an avid reader and have been most of my life (I’m 41). I read daily and usually read between 75-100 books a year, sometimes more. I prefer paper books but as the selection has decreased at the library and went into the e-book realm, I’m had to go along with this change in order to get the genre I prefer. I’ve read on my phone (not fun) and the iPad but the screens bother my eyes and I just don’t believe it’s good for your brain or health long term. I finally found a better alternative in the Kindle Paperwhite. It’s the perfect size to hold, lightweight (huge plus!!) and thin. If I could change anything, it would be to have instructions in the box and that the screen would be more sensitive to turning pages. The battery lasts what feels like forever. I am so pleased!Overall, this is the perfect solution for a person who loves to read and wants access to e-books.

"Kindle Paperwhite Signature Edition (32 GB) – With a 6.8"" display, wireless charging, and auto-adjusting front light – Without Lockscreen Ads – Black",4.0,No USB Ethernet Support!  Humongous Oversight?!?,"Reviewed in the United States on August 1, 2022",Color: Black | Option: Without Kindle Unlimited,True,"Chose the more affordable Kindle Paperwhite Signature versus the more costly elegantly designed Kindle Oasis, due to having an inaccessible or unreplaceale battery.  No desire for spending a huge sum of money for an electronic device only having a battery lifetime of a few years and destined for the garbage can.  Yes, it's 2022 and I still own a Kindle DXG device as the battery is replaceable for the DXG, regardless of no longer being supported.I'm also a big fan of Amazon.com designing and selling, sometimes engineered right, Ereader devices and Ereader digital materials.  (eg. For the time period, the Kindle DXG was a device engineered right.)PROS1) Good lightweight reading device, however after extened reading, does become slightly uncomfortable to hold.2) Very nice lighting choices.  Lighting is really the only significant reason for upgrading from the Kindle DXG version.CONS1) Not compatible with USB ethernet devices, or apparently does not include/activate Linux USB ethernet device driver!  The device is only able to use or includes the Linux wireless driver!  So trying to use a USB-C ethernet device while residing at your home, forget it, must use wireless/wifi.2) Wish books could contain additional ebedded dictionary information, for Ebooks containing words not found within the common dictionary.  Such as common Japanese words.  Currently, readers must actively be connected to the Internet for accessing additional word look-up (dictionary) methods such as using Wikipedia.  Only workaround, highlight the words requiring Internet access for later retrieval or have the additional dictionaries installed for manual look-up.3) Collections, a long time lack luster feature and the only sorting method for readers having lot of a books.  Books should be allowed to be sorted by users' file system folders/directories.  (eg. Build/engineer correctly first, then build/engineer upon what works allowing for fallback methods.)4) Power button is on the bottom end.  Heard others complain as well, however likely required for moisture prevention/rating.  Just need to be a little careful, and sometimes accidentally pushed.",2 people found this helpful
"Kindle Paperwhite Signature Edition (32 GB) – With a 6.8"" display, wireless charging, and auto-adjusting front light – Without Lockscreen Ads – Black",5.0,"I love, love, love it","Reviewed in the United States on July 3, 2022",Color: Black | Option: Without Kindle Unlimited,True,"I love, love, love this Kindle! I’ve used the Kindle app on my iPhone and iPad for many years; it is hands down the absolute best reading app. I spend an average of 8 hours a day reading on my iPad, and my daughter has been after me for at least 4 years to buy a Kindle because it is better for the eyes. I was very resistant because the Kindle just seems to dark for me. My eyes do not gather as much light as most people’s do, so I always have my brightness levels set higher than most people and a lot of lights on around me. I’m visiting my daughter this month, and she became quite insistent that I try her Kindle for better eye health. I spent a day fiddling with her font settings—type, size, boldness— as well as the brightness. By the end of the day, I had found the settings that gave me a clear reading experience and realized that I liked the size/weight difference compared to my iPad, so I shopped for a Kindle. I decided on the 6.8” Signature model because I felt that the size difference was important for my old eyes and that I might want the higher storage capacity to buy audible books in the future. Even though my daughter’s 10th was nice, the clarity of the characters is significantly better on this edition. I am glad that I bought the slightly larger version as I’m able to use a smaller font, thus having to turn the pages less often. I like being able to tap the side of the page vs swiping to turn pages. Daughter said that hers worked the same way, but I couldn’t get it to work and hadn’t gotten used to the slight flicker at the top, left corner of the page as it turns. This one is more seamless. Also there are more levels of brightness on this edition than on her 10th generation, and that has increased my reading experience. Another big win for the Kindle over the iPad is the battery life. I am very happy with my purchase and recommend this Kindle.",2 people found this helpful

This device they got right.  The larger screen is really great and the battery life is as promised.  I downloaded 6 books and read 5 plus a bit of the 6th before having to recharge which is really great.Now to the user interface which is problematic.  The ""upgraded"" user interface is pretty much unusable with a large library since the introduction of the thumbnail picture of book covers and the removal of the search for page & author.  The slide bar is just not useable when there are a large number of books in the library.  I would have to slide the dang thing 600 times to scroll through my library which is not doable.Also, many of us have spent years building collections which are useless under the current interface.  Collections can't really be brought to the forefront and used to classify books without going through all the slider stuff which isn't helpful either.And now to the worst part.  Everyone gets older and with that challenge comes changes in vision.  The menu's and library pages can't be enlarged and essentially I have to use a magnifying glass to be able to read them.  You would think there would be a solution to that as the font on books can be changed, but after multiple discussions with Kindle support the answer is NO.  I tried an Oasis but it is an unwieldly mess and the battery life was HORRIBLE despite the advertised additional life.  Returned it as unusable.  I do not like reading on an IPad or other tablet due to the weight, and the shiny screen which in the sunlight reflects horribly and is the whole point of the Kindle, to look like paper.I'm pretty much stuck due to my extensive library which would be difficult to recreate on another platform so Amazon, please fix the user interface problem.

I like the background bright so the contrast makes the text stand out, and the Paperwhite brightness control gives me adequate flexibility. Once you open your book, this device performs well.What I don't like, however, more than anything else, is the clunky interface. Menus are not easy to access and response is slow. There is an option to categorize collections, but it is inflexible and cumbersome to use. When attempting to access Wikipedia for something in a book's text, the link fails almost every time. One of the books I'm reading has some dialogue in Spanish, but it's not possible to add a second dictionary to look up the words I don't recognize.Like the title says, the Kindle Paperwhite is good enough if you just want a simple, lightweight ebook reader.

WHY would you put this button on the bottom? Either design a cover that includes a ‘ledge’ so the bottom where the button is located never actually touches what it is standing on, or move this button. The current cover - unlike my previous cover for my previous Kindle - does not have that little ledge.  Added a picture to demonstrate - orange is old Kindle with cover. The one above with button clearly sticking out newer Kindle and cover. So I suggest spending money on a different cover if you buy this.Otherwise the updates and screen on the new Kindle is awesome.",One person found this helpful

My issues with this Kindle are the fact that sometimes where you touch on the screen to go backwards it jumps forwards two pages. It told me I had battery power left on the Kindle and then wooden power on because it needed to be charged. I checked it before walking out the door. The other part I would like changed is on the home screen any book you buy appears across the top and you can't remove them. I don't read books that fast and I don't like hunting for the last book I was reading. I would appreciate this changed.,One person found this helpful

But that really doesn’t bother me because, you really only need to touch the screen for page turning periodically. You can adjust the screen warmness, brightness, text font, and font boldness which I really appreciate. It is perfect for what I needed it for. :)",5 people found this helpful

I’m a big audiobook listener so the fact that audible integrates onto the device is pretty cool.Overall: I wasn’t sure I needed the signature or the plain paperwhite, but I’m so glad I got the signature.

Have not read a book for my own enjoyment for many years. I decided to buy a Kindle to start reading for fun, primarily self-improvement books like Atomic Habits in order to better my life. As someone who has ADHD, a Kindle allows me to reduce the number of distractions. Unlike a computer or phone where a simple click or swipe allows you to get distracted from reading. A kindle allows you to just focus on reading as well as being a great form factor and holding many books. And unlike a phone or computer, it is easy on the eyes.I've now read 2 books since I bought the Kindle a week ago. I bring this with me in my jacket pocket(barely noticeable) when I commute. Can't wait to read many more. Another pro with the kindle is you can download PDFs on your computer and then email them to your kindle email and it will transfer it to your Kindle. This opens more possibilities for people who don't have the funds to buy all the books.",7 people found this helpful

Wouldn’t work for me because I paid about $120 as part of the bundle. Went on chat with Amazon customer service rep and I have to tell you I was extremely impressed with the service.

"Kindle Paperwhite Signature Edition (32 GB) – With a 6.8"" display, wireless charging, and auto-adjusting front light – Without Lockscreen Ads – Black",2.0,Very mixed bag. trending worse with updated review,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on December 24, 2021",Color: Black | Option: Without Kindle Unlimited,True,"The badThe battery though slightly better than my 2 gen old paperwhite still only last for about a day and a half.  Amazon's method of estimating battery life is a bit of a cheat. Basing it on a half hour of reading a day is ridiculous.  Some if us actually read books rather than pretending we can read. Its irritating but nothing new with Amazon.The new kindle is much less stable than the old one. My old one might lock up and crash every other week and the restart. Say every 50 or 60 hrs of reading. The new one which has updated since I got it a couple weeks ago crashes every day at least once. So....very serious down check there.3rd negative.. the older paperwhite had a bezel that the screen was inset into. Less risk of damage with that design as well as the more important point that it gave you a decent grip on it when holding it with one hand. Between larger size and lack of any texture such as that bezel this is a decent negative.ProsLove the lighter weight. It is notably lighter than my older paperwhite.Love the larger screen. Even with the slightly more awkwardness due to size.Love the 32 gigs storage. I was constantly fighting a lack on the old one (have the signature ed)Love love the usb c. I hated the old micro usb charging as it was failing due to wear of using it every day to charge. Also love that this unit charges in a couple hours compared to 8 or 9 hrs with old one.Wireless charging is nice but not a make or break thing for me. The way my bedside charging is set up it has ended up easier to just grab one of the usbc cables and plug it in rather than try and get it on the wireless charger and verify it is actually charging.Also like that it is supposed to be waterproof.If the crashing gets resolved i will  change to a 4 out 5 review.update jan 2023.. bought oct 2021 received just before christmas that year so I have been using it constantly for 13 months.Reduced rating to 2 starsThe locking up and rebooting have never gotten better through updates over the last year.In the last month or two all my books will disapear and have to be downloaded again. This has happened a couple times and amazon will ask me to re-download and when that works they go ok all fixed, and I go no its not fixed I had over a 1000 books disapear that were in my I want to read someday list on there and I have no clue what they are now because they are gone. Oh after last time it happened I side loaded about 400 books back on to it and it only saw about 100 of them.. Looked like the indexing job that scans them to show in the interface quit before it started and you can't get it to try again.  Whats the use of having a digital e-reader that I can't read all my books on. I spent extra for the 32 gig version because I always keep a lot of books on it. Suspiciously the books that dont show up are sideloaded books. Same ones that did show up till this issue started happening. I'm left wondering if amazon is pushing without saying so to only read books for the amazon store on their devices. Really really irked.In general this has been the slowest kindle I have ever owned and I have had them  since the first generation and I always buy the nicer version of which ever one I get. More storage or 3g connectivity when that was still a thing etc.. This one is the signature edition which was a bit more expensive. My speculation is that they saved a few dimes and put a cheaper processor in it. I'm constantly dealing with page lag when going to the next page and hanging up for 5 to 10 seconds a lot before it locks up and needs to be rebooted. I have reset it, no change.At this point I'm going to get one of the new generation larger android color e-ink devices that you can draw on, use play store so you can put apps on it and use it as a general purpose tablet as well as a reader. 1/2 of my reading is stuff not through amazon so not being able to use the kindle is rough.one of amazon's e-ink devices is still one of the only choices in my mind to read books through amazon on but do yourself a favor and avoid the 2021 paperwhite.oh another thing over the years I have noticed is that if you are hooked to the internet they can log into your device anytime they want. Every time I do a support call they will log in and change settings or look at stuff without need you to give them access.. That makes me uneasy. It's not particular to this kindle paperwhite model though, any of their tablets or kindles, alexa devices etc have that capability to allow them to access it whenever they want.",5 people found this helpful

This one is very difficult to adjust the settings for chapter timing, book page, etc. It works ok for reading, usually. But too often when I shut it up, when I come back to read again, I am pages off from where I had stopped. It has just too many little ""bugs"" that make it a mystery to use. Mystery being a polite word here. If my old Paperwhite hadn't had a worn out screen (I read much more than an average reader, and that one was the second one I had worn little pinholes into the screen.), I would have rather kept my old one. Since this is my third Kindle, I am disappointed in it! But since I already had to return the first one I received for Christmas, I just kept this second one.

I first purchased a Boox Nova Air because I wanted to use Hoopla to borrow library books (as well as Libby), since many titles at my library use Hoopla. Hoopla is NOT supported by Kindle. I didn’t buy the Boox to use the sketch or note-taking features. After one month of use my puppy picked up my Boox in its sturdy case and chewed it a bit. There wasn’t visible damage on the tablet, but the pressure from his teeth cause the Boox’s SUPER DELICATE screen to stop working, which isn’t covered under warranty, so it’s now garbage. After one month. So I decided to buy the much less expensive Kindle Signature. I love it! The screen is much faster in its response time, there’s no waiting for the thing to boot up, it takes you right to where you left off, the text is beautifully clear with no ghosting. I love the auto-adjust light. No Hoopla, but many of the titles I’ve borrowed lately have been available via Libby, and kindle editions of books are very inexpensive. It’s a little smaller than the Boox, but that doesn’t bother me, and actually fits my hands better.  I love that the lock screen shows me my current book cover. If you just want to read books, choose this over a Boox. Super happy with it!",4 people found this helpful

"Kindle Paperwhite Signature Edition (32 GB) – With a 6.8"" display, wireless charging, and auto-adjusting front light – Without Lockscreen Ads – Black",5.0,Fast enough for foreign language study,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on April 2, 2022",Color: Black | Option: Without Kindle Unlimited,True,"This is my fourth e-reader. I'm upgrading from a 6th gen Paperwhite. This feels 2-3x faster and makes all the difference for the main purpose I've been waiting for, for years: being able to read a foreign language text where you need to look up a large number of words.I haven't carefully followed the evolution of these features, but now when you buy a Russian e-book, and first try to open it, it automatically downloads an ABBYY Russian-English dictionary. Long pressing on a word pops up the dictionary entry, if found. Otherwise, it searches Russian Wikipedia, but you can swipe over to a Translation tab that does something akin to Google Translate (on a word or entire passage). It takes just 1-2 seconds, so much faster than a physical dictionary. This is phenomenal and I think completely changes the world of foreign language study for someone who likes to read.The Vocabulary Builder feature and flashcards are particularly useful in this context as well!Secondly, I love the wireless charging feature on this edition. I expect it to mean not wearing out the charging port.Third, I love the new photography they feature on the lock screen. Artistic collections of fountain pens, pencils, letters, newspapers, and so on. It's the perfect front cover for my Kindle (apart from the highly recommended leather case).Back to my foreign language study, it could still be improved. The Wikipedia so far doesn't do me much good, so I wish I could configure the Translation tab to come up first (if the dictionary doesn't work). The dictionary often doesn't, I suspect because it is indexed only by the non-inflected word forms (such as verb infinitives). So some code and indexing could increase the hit rate. Alternately, a fuzzier search of the dictionary that provides likely matches could be useful.The Vocabulary Builder could also be improved. It should keep separate lists by language. It would be nice if you could drill yourself intentionally with flashcards (with say 20 words until you master them) rather than looping through the entire set. I have 650 already after reading three Chekhov short stories! :)I haven't tried other languages yet. I hope it's the same experience in German, French, Spanish, and Greek, which I should eventually get around to trying.",One person found this helpful

In fact, every time my thumb twitches the page changes. The screen is so sensitive that often not just one page flips over, several do. So I have to leaf back to find the page I was on - annoying!  I have a cover on the Kindle, which gives a little more space to grip, but not enough to prevent the unintended page turning.

The idea was always felt like ""a thousand books inside your pocket"". It was, and is, a great feeling to have so many options to read with so little to carry. The new Kindle Paperwhite is a marvel in that it provides everything it's predecessor did, and of course more (otherwise why change?). The amber light is perfect for reading just before bed, the response time is leagues better, and the resolution has made me feel like a got a stronger pair of glasses (because the definition is much sharper).However my one gripe is a small yet big change. They made this model bigger. Understandably it likely had to do with allowing more page-room for reading, perhaps better mimicking the book experience. However perhaps what was unseen is that due to this slight change it is suddenly just barely too big to fit into pockets. Pants pockets, jacket pockets, and it has sized out of some smaller backpack pockets it used to fit within. This is a shame. The promise of that thousand books in your pocket is still partially there, you just have to carry it in your hand inconveniently somewhere. If I could make the choice again, I would sacrifice all the new features for my older model which is smaller. Unfortunately I traded it in. Yet this kindle is still wonderful, and if it is your first, you are bound to enjoy it.",2 people found this helpful

I decided to buy the new generation’s signature edition as my old one is now running quite slowly and I wanted to purchase or download my college course materials onto it for easier transport and storage, and knew I couldn’t sit in class waiting for a page to load for two minutes. This purchase did NOT disappoint. I’m amazed at the speed this device operates, and there is little to no ghosting that I’ve noticed. I’ve read textbooks, comics, and fun books on it (including PDFs I’ve sent to it) and none of them have proven an issue for this excellent piece of equipment. Accessing Goodreads on it, or even the internet browser, was an added bonus I didn’t realize I’d appreciate so much! This is one of the best investments I’ve made towards my schooling and my reading. The compatibility with audiobooks was another surprise I didn’t see coming. The only thing I’ve noticed is that the battery life doesn’t seem as long as my old Kindle. It seemed like I could plug the old one in overnight and it would last an entire month of fairly consistent use! This one I find myself docking far more often, and as unfortunate as that is, it only makes me appreciate the wireless charging dock more. Otherwise, zero complaints from me, though I’d say that last one doesn’t count as a complaint, considering this device still lasts longer than my phone and laptop battery! If you’re looking for your next E-Reader, look no further than this, you won’t regret it.",4 people found this helpful

"Kindle Paperwhite Signature Edition (32 GB) – With a 6.8"" display, wireless charging, and auto-adjusting front light – Without Lockscreen Ads – Black",4.0,Just a few flaws with this excellent reader,"Reviewed in the United States on April 23, 2022",Color: Black | Option: Without Kindle Unlimited,True,"The Paperwhite Signature Edition screen's adjustable and automatic brightness, the selectable fonts and their sizes, and the adjustable screen tint are all positives and very welcome. The size is satisfactory and the weight is OK.I have all but given up buying actual books over the years and have substituted Kindle issues instead. I've owned 5 Kindles, starting with the ""keyboard"" (which still works fine) and it's been interesting watching the technical advancement over the years. I've accepted the Kindle as my primary reader for novels of which I read nearly 100 per year.Perhaps it is poor luck, or perhaps a decrease in reliability, but I've returned two Signature Editions and am hopeful this third one is not flawed. The first one, after a month, had intermittent battery problems and the second one locked up on the graphic of the kid under the tree and wouldn't change. Fortunately, Amazon is extremely good at replacing faulty items of which I am very thankful.The other little inconveniences I've noticed with the Signature is the sensitivity of the screen when page turning seems variable. Many times, it seems to turn two pages instead of one and sometimes I need to touch several times to get it to turn a page at all. I would like to see that become either an adjustable setting or actually retro back to the paging buttons of the keyboard issue. The old keyboard issue also had audible reading function which would be nice to return. The menu and library functions have not advanced much and are awkward. I wish after you read a book, it would automatically put it in a separate ""read"" section so it wouldn't interfere with browsing your unread books.But most of all, I cannot understand why they have not moved the power button to the top of the reader instead of placing it right under your finger of your right hand where it accidentally gets turned off as you're reading. Even the keyboard issue, which had it's power button in the same place, was better, because it was slide-operated instead of push operated.Nevertheless, I highly recommend digital books and the Kindle readers for your reading enjoyment.",2 people found this helpful

Didn't trade in because I wanted a spare Kindle, just in case. Saw the latest Signature version and finally traded in my Gen 6, choosing the bundled offer as I needed a cover and wanted to take advantage of the wireless charging feature.Love the Signature Paperwhite and the 32G of storage. ​Didn't think there would be much difference between my 10th Gen 8G (with ads) but this is truly an upgrade. Books download almost instantly, and with plenty of storage onboard don't think I'll ever run out of room. I can choose my lighting shade and brightness, and fonts and such are easier to manage. I can see even better than before inside or out, day or night. The on/off button is positioned better for me, I'm left-handed, and haven't accidentally turned off my Kindle once during the approx 10 books I've read since purchase. Didn't really think the ads used to bother me. However, now when I open my Kindle without ads it takes me directly to the last page read, more like a traditional book. No distractions invading my precious reading time. The 11th Gen is slightly bigger, nicely balanced in my hand. Arthritis is creeping in, yet I can hold the book for extended periods and easily manage the touchscreen. Notes are becoming evermore intuitive, therefore easier to use. My new Kindle seems to stay cleaner and look nicer, overall. No noticeable fingerprints or crumbs stuck around the edges anymore. Okay, I admit that I read during dinner almost every night, but I do use fragrance free, gentle, disposable face cloths or microfiber cloths to wipe it clean. Wireless charging is easy, just follow the instructions. Have only charged it once since it really does have a longer battery life than previous generations. Miss my 10th Gen premium leather cover a lot, the 11th Gen leather cover doesn't feel like leather. Has the plastic feeling of reconstituted leather. Found an Oberon Design leather cover that I'm going to invest in. Reading is my passion, and the cover is part of the experience. Thought I'd never give up hard cover and paper back books. But in 2018 I started donating my collection, and now have one small bookshelf left, filled with books I've yet to read or special keepsakes. I have a lot more space, and a lot less to dust.",3 people found this helpful

I originally bought it to study for technical exams, but have since enjoyed reading recreationally. While I have tons of tech, and access to Audible and the Kindle reader on my iPhone and iPad, they are also too distracting, often eye-straining, heavy, and constantly in need of charging.The Kindle Paper White is a reading device that’s easy to use and maintain, lightweight and unobtrusive, easy on the eyes in any lighting easy find reading material. Not only can you get books or audio books from Amazon Kindle or Audible, but you can usually get them from your local public library for free. I use the Libby app on my iPad, connected to my local library system to find books in Kindle format, and can then access them on the Kindle.Battery life, for my moderate daily use is insane… about 3+ weeks between charging, and I can charge via cord or wireless on the same wireless charging pad that my iPhone uses.For the case I opted for much more affordable and more versatile Fintie Stand Case for $20 US, about half the cost of the Kindle Leather cover.In summary, it’s a purpose designed and built reader that does a great job as a reader, and without all of the distractions of other devices.",5 people found this helpful
"Kindle Paperwhite Signature Edition (32 GB) – With a 6.8"" display, wireless charging, and auto-adjusting front light – Without Lockscreen Ads – Black",1.0,Software constantly crashed and froze,"Reviewed in the United States on January 8, 2023",Color: Black | Option: Without Kindle Unlimited,True,"I have had several Kindle Paperwhite’s in the past. I was so excited to see this newest version with the 32 GB since they’ve discontinued the option for 32 GB on the regular Kindle Paperwhite. From day one it was unfortunately a complete POS. I can’t tell you how many times it froze in the first week alone, and I had to restart it with hard resets, which would take up to 30 minutes before I could get back into the book I was reading. Then recently, the dark mode became completely unresponsive, so I can’t get out of it and that is the only way I can read the books anymore. Then, when I finish reading a book I would tap the library tab, but that also became completely unresponsive, and I could never get back to the library unless I did another hard reset, which took another 20 to 30 minutes before it would respond and I could get back into the library.I had considered exchanging it for another one, but after reading many other negative reviews by people that have the same issues, it seems they didn’t have any more luck with the new e-reader sent to them. I didn’t want to risk it since I’m so close to my return window expiring. It will be interesting to see how the return goes since I was going to trade in my old Kindle Paperwhite 10th generation 32 GB for this one. Luckily I hadn’t sent it in yet because the minute I started having these issues I decided to wait. I would purchase the brand new Kindle Paperwhite that came out this week if they hadn’t gotten rid of the 32 GB option and only offer up to 16 GB now. I know to most people that seems plenty but not for everything I like loaded on my e-reader.I was also excited to see the new Signature Edition offered a warm setting since I used to have a Barnes & Noble Nook and they had a great warm setting on theirs. I didn’t really care for the one on this one as much though, and just kept it in the dark mode to read in the evening. I just don’t understand why they can’t have the same software that they have on their Kindle Fires. I have one of those, but the battery goes down ridiculously fast, even if I have it in airplane mode when I’m reading, so it’s not even an option to read on that one.And don’t get me going on the software update they did several months ago, where someone in their infinite stupidity, decided to get rid of the back button. I used to be able to look up an author, scroll through the books, go into a book, and then if I wanted to check another book by the same author, I could just hit the back button and go down the authors list again. Once they got rid of the back button (it used to be located in the upper left-hand corner right next to the library back button ) now every time I want to do that, I have to go back to the library, put in another search, put in the authors name again and start over.Maybe you’ll be one of the lucky ones if you purchase this e-reader and have more luck than I did with it. I decided to purchase a new one because my Kindle Paperwhite 10th generation was 4 years old and had started to freeze occasionally, but nowhere near the the level this one did. I guess I’ll just have to keep that one until something better comes along somewhere down the road when they hopefully have solved their software issues. I’m still holding out hope that with some future upgrade on the software, they’ll bring the back button back as well.",8 people found this helpful

"Kindle Paperwhite Signature Edition (32 GB) – With a 6.8"" display, wireless charging, and auto-adjusting front light – Without Lockscreen Ads – Black",3.0,"This is a painful upgrade, and it shouldn't be","Reviewed in the United States on December 28, 2021",Color: Black | Option: Without Kindle Unlimited,True,"I've stuck with the same Kindle Paperwhite since just before Columbus sailed off to find India, and missed, so I had no idea what I was in for when I decided it was time to get the latest and greatest. It arrived tonight, just about an hour ago.Unboxing? Piece of cake. Nice look, nice feel. Slid right into the leather cover I also bought for it. Booted right up, and we went into setup. A bit of a stumble when it came time to enter my password, but hey, my fault for using a complex password. Then it started on the endless (as far as I know, it is endless) series of ""Do you want to buy this/subscribe to this/get this?"" No to everything isn't an option, so one at a time, until I got to that Amazon Kindle subscription service they always push. Choosing no wasn't an option. Sure, it said I could choose no, but pressing the ""No thanks"" button got me exactly nowhere. After a couple minutes of having it ignore No thanks and insist I choose something else, I forced a reboot, because I am NOT going to get something I don't want, just because they really want me to. When it came back up, we'd moved past all the questions, and I was looking at my library. It had gotten there suspiciously fast. So I tried to open a book. No dice. The books were listed - I could see the cover art - but I had to download each book separately, by going in and trying to open it.What about the poor people who don't check and find out until they're out of wifi range? Gee, too bad for them, I guess. No warning of this, of course.I've been going through page after page of books, downloading each one, and it's painfully slow. It isn't my connection, that's fast. I can stream 4K to 3 televisions at the same time, and still browse the internet, without any problems, so the slowness is on the Amazon side. Oh, and there's an exciting new feature! It shows the cover art, until I download the book. Then the cover art disappears, and it's just the generic Kindle rectangle, with the book title. And the book series aren't numbered, like they were on my old Kindle. And as I've downloaded more books (on my Signature series, that boasts being able to hold thousands of books) the screen response time has gotten slower, and slower, and slower. Right now it's about 2-3 seconds between touching the screen, and having the Kindle do anything.My hope is, the new Kindle is just indexing everything, and that's what is bogging it down so much. Sure, they could have coded it to wait until after there was no activity for a few minutes to start indexing, but I live in hope.Oh, and the book sorting is, of course, totally hosed. The book series I was in the middle of reading before the upgrade is buried somewhere down around page 47 in the library. And it didn't restore my placemark, so I'll have to hunt around and see if I can find where I left off. But I won't have to worry about that until I've gone through and downloaded all the books, one at a time. I'm on Page 24 of 48. And I've only been doing this for an hour.Hey, Kindle programmers! I have an idea! After the setup, give me a button that says ""Download complete library"". And whatever it's doing besides downloading books, hold off on that until they're all downloaded. I could be watching TV, or entertaining my parrot, or playing with my dogs, but instead I'm babysitting an electronic appliance. In case it's been too subtle, I resent the time I'm wasting doing it.",54 people found this helpful

It's a little bigger (6.8"" vs. 6"") but I think that is big enough - if they get too big then they are, basically iPads - so this version is it for at least a while.  I do like the wireless charging (so obviously I bought a charging dock as well).  The new cover I bought matches the fabric on the charger - so that's nice.  I'm not sure the ""new"" lighting is any different for me than the old lighting.  So all-in-all I suppose this version is a little better, but it's kind of like upgrading an iWatch - nice, but not necessary.  I did, however, feel the previous one needed to be recharged more often than when it was new - so that was part of my rationale for buying the new one (or was it merely a rationalization).

"Kindle Paperwhite Signature Edition (32 GB) – With a 6.8"" display, wireless charging, and auto-adjusting front light – Without Lockscreen Ads – Black",5.0,Went a bit beyond my expectations,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on December 1, 2021",Color: Black | Option: Without Kindle Unlimited,True,"I've had this for over a month now and have finally used it enough to provide some feedback.  First, the main thing that took getting used to was the size...it's bigger and at first it felt too big.  But after a couple of weeks, it feels just right and I appreciate the extra space on the screen.  It's still relatively light and easy to hold.As for the screen, the lighting does seem more uniform, and I really appreciate the warm lighting, especially when reading in bed.  It does not seem to affect my spouse's sleep whenever I end up reading in bed and she is asleep.  And I think I end up going to sleep sooner after reading with this lighting...I'm guessing less blue spectrum is helping with that.USB-C, ah would have been a deal breaker for me and I would have jumped ship had it not been on this Kindle.  It's great to have it and it should have been on the last version.  The wireless charging works fine and gives me another option for charging it.  As for the power button on the bottom, it's a non-issue, and I haven't accidentally turned it on or off even once.I'm not a great fan of the newer UI, but if you tweak it a bit, you can make it more classic, so I'm fine with that.  It is maybe a bit faster than my last paperwhite when turning pages, but is always responsive.  There have been very, very few times that I've had to touch the side twice to get it to turn.  It's certainly more responsive than my 2017 model Paperwhite.  It does take a bit longer to actually wake when it's been off for a longer time.  But wake-up is pretty snappy if you haven't had it off for many hours (just timed it...about 1 sec).Battery life seems better than my 2017 model.  I replaced the battery in that older version and the comparison is a noticeable improvement even over that new battery.  I think I've charged it twice over the past 5 or 6 weeks.  I read just less than 1 book per week for comparison so your battery mileage may vary depending on how much you use wifi, and how bright you like your screen.Overall, I'm very glad I purchased this and it did exceed my expectations.",5 people found this helpful

But if that doesn't bother you and you have no need for a colored book cover or care for books with colorful illustrations and you do read a lot often and do it outdoors... Then, you'll probably like it and should get it. I returned mine and bought a tablet and installed the kindle app. Now I have colors, bigger screen and no flashing screen.

Thank goodness! (Now if they could work on that tedious web experience.) Giving it another star,***Have to put the old 2012 and 2013 Kindle Fires out to pasture due to discontinuation of access to the store and other apps no longer supporting the format.I read so many great reviews on the Signature, and was drawn particularly because of the ease of reading, which I need.  Unfortunately, I was surprised and disappointed to find poor visual quality of both the library and the store. I’m not sure I’ll be able to make this work for me.Also you can’t zoom or pinch the covers nor do they enlarge once selecting the title. My library covers are hard to see as well.

I was mainly intrigued by the warm light settings and the wireless charging, but have been pleasantly surprised by a few other things too. The newer touch screen is a true upgrade from the older edition I had; this one's much more responsive to my touch and the refresh rate is so much faster. I love the slightly bigger screen and that there's a dark mode setting which I hadn't expected! I love reading at night before going to sleep and being able to turn my lamp off and putting the kindle in dark mode really helps me relax more and fall asleep quicker. There's also some minor differences that I like, too, like the fact that the bezel and screen are flush and the bezel is thinner which makes it easier for me to turn the page when I'm holding it with one hand. I do think the price tags on Kindles are somewhat high these days even for all these features you get compared to the basic model. I got this one on Prime Day sale. I traded in my old kindle for a $25 credit and 20% off this new kindle which ended up making this purchase worth it for me, so keep that in mind if you're having trouble justifying the cost...they do go on sale every so often. All in all, I think this was a great upgrade for me and I do highly recommend this model (coming from someone who's had Kindles since they first came out).",2 people found this helpful

Previously, i used either my phone, ipad or a samsung tablet for reading. What i did not understand is that phones and tablets operate with backlit LED technology, where the kindle e-readers use the e-ink technology.So why is this important... well, i can now read outside in the sunlight and still be able to read my book without the glare and low contrast that is inherent with LED based screens. I can read with my sunglasses on, even. I can also read late at night and when i am finished reading, i am able to fall asleep quickly (the back lighting from LEDs stimulates the brain and messes with your circadian rhythms). I am now able to stop reading... on the LED devices, there is a compulsiveness associated with those screens... its similar to the way that the casino video terminals / VLTs work... the lights and motion stimulates dopamine. As someone with ADHD, this can be a challenge. Now i have better control over my reading, I am able to savor my book choices, i am sleeping better and more consistently, and i am able to read whereever i want.This is the best thing ive purchased in years!!",

My first, and by far most egregious, complaint is not being able to write a review at the end of a book. I have this ability on my Kindle app as well as every other Kindle product. Fix this!My second complaint, and one I have for all Kindle devices, is the power supply icon doesn’t show while reading. I know it’s a problem that has been addressed. I would like the fix to be rolled out to all devices in an update.My third complaint, which is more of an annoyance, is how long it takes to wake up when turning on. It’s twice as long as my Kindle Fire and does half as much. A turtle race would run faster.I do like the battery life. I also like the softer lighting when reading at night. Those are both stellar!!!",

The battery life is GREAT.  I've been reading quite a bit (hours a day) and also turning it on and off a lot while loading books and messing around with settings.  I'm leaving WIFI on all the time. After 4 days, power is still at 88%.  My Oasis would have definitely been close to needing charging by now, even with WIFI off.  I've also engaged the automatic light setting that warms the color (I have it set at about the middle warmth setting from 8 pm to 8am for my evening reading and morning paper).  Very nice.  I used to use the 'dark' setting in the evening.  That was fine, but it was kind of a strange reading experience.  The warm color is very comfortable and pleasant, and still lowers the ambient light so that my wife is not bothered by it if I read late in bed.  Finally, this unit downloads very quickly compared to the Oasis and my other previous Kindles.  I checked the specs and it is capable of using the 5G WIFI channel.  Nice!I am an avid reader and have owned every Kindle model except the latest OASIS, which was a very minor update to the second version from 2017.  I currently use the second OASIS model and am a fan.  However, the glass/metal design is a bit heavy when combined with its size and it was always a bit slippery to hold.  When I saw this Paperwhite Signature update with a screen that is virtually the same size as the OASIS (looks the same when placed side by side, but it is listed as slightly smaller) in a smaller, somewhat lighter package along with wireless charging, I was sold.  The low price is a bonus.I noticed the increase in speed immediately.  The screen quality is great and I will enjoy the different color shades carried over from the newest OASIS.  It wirelessly charges seamlessly.  GREAT.  The extra storage capacity is not a big deal for me, since I only store books, but I'll take it.I haven't had it long enough to comment on battery life, but anything is better than the OASIS, which sucks battery power, and I would guess this will be an improvement.All in all a nice update, and except for the page turn buttons, gives you pretty much everything the  current OASIS has to offer in a smaller, lighter package with some nice updates.  Very happy!Edit:  I downloaded the software update, which is now on the kindle update page. Very nice. I assume it will auto update for most users soon",246 people found this helpful

To my surprise the power light began to flash? After about three flashes I released it and 'Lo and behold' my kindle screen went from white to asking what I wanted to do! Restart was a choice (really the only one that seemed to do something) and when I tapped it my Kindle gave me a start screen with the bar indicating progress.

I like the leather cover much better.  Cleaner / simpler without that silver latch.  I like that the cover magnetically stays held against the back when open.  I don't think my old one did that.  USB-C BIG YES.  The screen is completely evenly lit without the annoying hot spots.  A few more fonts to pick from.  DARK MODE!!!  Makes SO MUCH SENSE.

"Kindle Paperwhite Signature Edition (32 GB) – With a 6.8"" display, wireless charging, and auto-adjusting front light – Without Lockscreen Ads – Black",2.0,A big let down.,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on November 24, 2022",Color: Black | Option: Without Kindle Unlimited,True,"I just got my 11th generation kindle signature version. I normally use my iPad or iPhone to read Kindle. I have been considering getting a Kindle for years and I finally gave in and got one for the sake of eye strain because I read for several hours at a time.Pros:-light weight-long battery-less eye strainCons:It regularly turns the page more than once if I tap/swipe the screen one time. It also goes the wrong direction when I want to go back to a page because it went forward too many times. I know there’s a delay because of the device technology and the fact that it is a digital ink, However it does not respond well to touch in multiple ways. Swiping only works well if you press firmly and swipe. Half the time the lights swipes I make do not work well or they turn in the wrong direction. The most infuriating part is the fact that the power/screen saver button is on the bottom next to the charging port. I cannot begin to state how bad of a design flaw this is. No one I know holds a book from the top or a device from the top. Holding both sides of the device for long periods of time is not comfortable let alone normal body mechanics. And it is ridiculous to think anyone will hold it with two hands either.  You cannot hold the device one-handed like you would any book or phone or tablet and not have it continually and accidentally activate the screen saver button. You can’t even use most stands that have a space for the charging port or not at the bottom and not accidentally turn the kindle off. I’m upset that I even paid extra to get the one without advertisements and the whole device works so poorly and is so poorly designed after the 11th generation! I am heavily considering returning the product though I am not the type of person that likes to return something unless it’s broken or is not what is advertised. This will likely be the last time I ever purchased a Kindle product if they can’t get the most basics of design and function down after 11 generations. Worst part is I bought another Kindle paperwhite for my brother at the same time and he is not a big reader. He is also not patient with things that have issues. If his book that he reads continually switches to screen saver mode/turns off while he’s reading, it will only take a few times and he will never pick it up again. I have wasted a lot of money both for myself and  as a gift. Lesson learned.After watching the video again of the product, I noticed how everyone was holding it in the advertisement. Not something I would’ve thought to look for, or at, before I purchased it. But none of them hold it like you would normally with a finger underneath. The way they hold it, it will always slide out of your hand with or without a case. Unless they have Spiderman grip it will not stay in your hand like that easily, or for long.  You have to put one finger or so on the bottom to hold it from sliding down like you would any device you’re holding in your hand. Even if you wedge it into your palm, the moment you shift, change hands or otherwise, it still has the same problem with slipping.  So even in the advertisement,they are being subtly deceptive.",6 people found this helpful

Unfortunately, I cracked my previous Kindle when I dropped it on its face.  The last edition, I was able to download anywhere without WiFi.  This addition you need to be connected to wifi.

I thought I was buying a Kindle free of advertisement, but I guess they feel the book recommendations aren't advertisement.  I beg to differ on that point.  I hate that the home page shows the cover of the book.  I like my books in list form without the cover.  When in public if I have a risky front page, I don't want everyone seeing what I'm reading.  It's also annoying to have to scroll to find a book since most of the home screen are book recommendations. When trying to remove a book from the home screen most of the time I can't get it removed from my view.I don't know what the issue with this edition is but I've had to restart my Kindle much more for being frozen and or missing the home screen function.  This is the first Kindle that I've owned that I am disappointed in the functionality.  I really want my old Kindle back.  Less freezing and no advertisements.  So much for new and improved.  Good for authors who pay for their recommendations to appear in certain genres.",2 people found this helpful

I've never been an elitist when it came to kindle models before, but the lack of sharpness in the new paperwhite may have turned me into a Voyage stan.It is INSANE to be that what is a nearly $200 device cannot even begin to compete with an extinct kindle model when it comes to text sharpness.

I can fit the kindle with the kindle cover in the front pocket of my Docker's pants, and I am a smaller than average size man.  The brightness and contrast of the screen are easy to read during the day and at night.I had a hard time getting used to Paperwhite Signature's squarish screen.  The screen's width is almost equal its height.  For a fast reader, this is non-optimal.  I felt like the lines were too wide and I was constantly turning pages.  It also made it harder to read long sections of programming code.The biggest disappointment was finding out the Paperwhite Signature cannot read a kindle book format that many technical books and textbooks are published in.  This is not ePub to mobi file format issue.  The Signature Paperwhite cannot read the following technical books I bought from Amazon's Kindle store:""Introduction to Algorithms"" 3rd Edition MIT Press""Understanding Cryptography: A textbook for Students and Practitioners""""Digital Communications: Fundamentals & Applications"" 2/eThese book are readable on the Kindle apps and my Kindle Fire 7, but the Signature Paperwhite says it is incompatible type.  (shown in the attached picture)I tried for two weeks to get used to wider aspect ratio of the screen and more frequent page turns, but every time I read on a Kindle App or my Kindle Fire 7, I enjoy the experience more.  After I found out I could not read all of my technical books on the Paperwhite Signature I decided to return it.  I run a software development business and primarily read technical books and business books, so this kindle version does not fit my needs.",21 people found this helpful

I decided to change that in 2022 by purchasing a Kindle Paperwhite.I am proud to say, I enjoy the reading experience on the E-Reader over physical books. For one, I can hold the kindle in one hand (usually I use 2, but I can use just one). This is a huge benefit because I have my other hand free if I need to. The Kindle is waterproof so I don't have to worry about the rain or wet hands if I go to the beach or travel. It is also the fraction of the weight of a book so I can bring it anywhere with ease!The only downsides to the Kindle were occasional glitches where the Kindle goes full white screen and I have to reset it. Another con is the fact that on occasion it will glitch and skip forward 2 pages on one press. What could also be a con is the fact is has a battery. The battery lasts a long time, I have not charged my device in over a month and it is still about 60%. It's all dependent on how much and how long you read. That being said, for most users it should last quite a long time.Overall, my experience with the Kindle has been nothing but phenomenal. The colors are great, the user experience is great, and it is worth the investment if you want to read just about anywhere.",

For the people who are jumping into the Kindle game assuming it’s a high tech piece of technology, you will be sorely disappointed. It’s not. It’s literally an electronic book that is supposed to serve one purpose and that is to read. The page turning is great, I prefer tapping/swiping vs. buttons to turn the page. It’s extremely anti-glare which is amazing, especially when reading on the beach. I haven’t had any issues with the power button being in my pinky space buuut I do see how it could get in the way.

I started with a second generation, then a Paperwhite, next the Voyage, and now this 11th Edition Paperwhite. I wear them out which is why I purchased another. Overall, I like the reading experience on this Kindle, I especially love the soft light feature. With many different fonts to choose from, it is easy to find one that makes reading easy. This screen is larger, so there will be less page turning, or if a larger font is needed, there will be more room. I haven't used this long enough to gage the battery life, but I was charging my Voyage 3-4 times a week so even if I only need charge this once a week, that'd be great, and the wireless charging is a big plus. One thing I do not like is the page turning. On this model, you touch anywhere on the right side to advance and anywhere on the left side to go backward. On my Voyage, there was a small area on the bottom left to touch to go backwards and you could touch the screen anywhere else to advance. This is a great feature if you are holding the Kindle with your left hand and want to turn the page. I truly miss this feature. Another thing I do not like is the highlights from others are on, and I cannot find how to turn highlights off. I do not care what passages others have found interesting and I find having them on to be distracting. I looked through the users guide and found nothing to help me in this area. Overall, I am happy with this Kindle and would recommend it. The longer battery life will def be appreciated.",

The quality of the screen, the auto/adjustable front/warm light, the excellent battery power, the speed of the device, the really nice page turn animation, etc... all combine to make this the best Paperwhite period.  However, the one thing that keeps it from getting 5 stars for me is the power button placement.  At least 2-3 times a week I end up accidentally pressing the power button as it's on the bottom of the device and too close to where I hold the Paperwhite. It's easy enough to press the power button and get back into reading but it's a subtle frustration that mars an otherwise excellent experience.  For future releases, I'm hoping the power button is moved to the top of the device instead.",3 people found this helpful

Having said that, I wish it would pick up the wifi better as it takes forever to open links. And I really dislike that “on” button at the bottom! It happens so often that my pinky will inevitably touch it while I’m holding the Kindle to read and then my screen goes into lock mode interrupting all the good parts of my book. Amazon please reconsider moving it to the top and you have a customer for life!",One person found this helpful
"Kindle Paperwhite Signature Edition (32 GB) – With a 6.8"" display, wireless charging, and auto-adjusting front light – Without Lockscreen Ads – Black",3.0,Why is it soooo slow,"Reviewed in the United States on January 28, 2023",Color: Black | Option: Without Kindle Unlimited,True,"I purchased this and another kindle model for the holidays and both have a delay when navigating. Made a purchase? Give it about 10-15 seconds to register on your screen. Searching for a book? Give it just as much time to display the results. Clicked on a book to inspect the details? Wait just as long to bring it up. Expect a delay when you type the title of the book you’re looking for and sometimes, it won’t display all the letters that you pressed, so you’ll have to backspace/delete and retype some of the letters once again. I complain because the kindle is such a reputable product, but has such a poor performance in comparison to other similar products in my past. I thought it was slow internet, but I’ve confirmed solid speeds. I’ve watched several reviews and this seems to be a common issue. In the end, it serves it’s purpose. 3 stars feels appropriate.",
"Kindle Paperwhite Signature Edition (32 GB) – With a 6.8"" display, wireless charging, and auto-adjusting front light – Without Lockscreen Ads – Black",5.0,Great Product HORRIBLE customer service,"Reviewed in the United States on August 9, 2022",Color: Black | Option: Without Kindle Unlimited,True,"BEWARE!I purchased the Kindle Paperwhite Signature Edition (32 GB) reader with all the extras planning to read my magazine and book subscriptions. I traded in an older Kindle and was credited $30. The new Kindle was delivered quickly, and I found it would only allow me to read books and magazines purchased from Kindle. I notified Amazon that I had authorization to return the Kindle I purchased, had done so and would now like to have my original kindle returned to me. After escalating me up the ladder twice and then hanging up twice, my third call was transferred to a ‘supervisor’ who informed me that I would be able to return the purchase, but they were unable to return my trade-in….and then she hung up. They did offer to sell me a Kindle comparable to my trade-in for $130.00, but there were “none available” which I find strange given that they have mine. So, the result is: I have no Kindle. Amazon has a used one now in their inventory that they will sell for $100 more than they paid me for it. Trust them in the future? Sure!",

"Kindle Paperwhite Signature Edition (32 GB) – With a 6.8"" display, wireless charging, and auto-adjusting front light – Without Lockscreen Ads – Black",4.0,A Worthy Upgrade,"Reviewed in the United States on November 13, 2021",Color: Black | Option: Without Kindle Unlimited,True,"This, for just the built in amber light alone and extra storage was worth the upgrade from my beloved Voyage. The larger size was a bit awkward at first but I got used to it quickly once my cover arrived, and speaking of covers - they are really necessary; they protect the device and actually make one handed reading much easier. The size is much bigger than my Voyage & while that one would easily fit in my smaller purses, this new Paperwhite is noticeably bigger and I'm not sure it was really necessary.Some have complained about ut the bottom on/off button & while I haven't found that a problem yet, I did prefer the button on the Voyage to this. Battery life is solid and sooo sooo glad of the USB upgrade!The amber lighting option is a game changer - I'm a non stop reader and bed reading is how I relax. The amber light is a much kinder light for tired eyes and reducing blue light later in the day is a must.After my Voyage I found the altered user interface a bit awkward & burying things like turning off other's highlights (it's in the Font menu in the ""More"" section - WTH?) and page turn automation in the Font menu rather than in Reading Options was just plain stupid. I mean, really? I had to search through reviews of the non signature version to figure out how to access those options, which, since this is now my 6th Kindle, I shouldn't have had to do. And that is why this is a 4 star device not a 5 star. Maybe they'll fix this issue in future firmware/ software upgrades (please!).Overall, I preferred my Voyage in terms of size and overall usability BUT I am not sorry that I bought this new Signature Edition. The lighting upgrade was a must for me and I really disliked the Oasis in terms of shape and price.So, the short answer is that whether you go for the regular or this Signature edition, the new Paperwhite is a must if you're an eReader fan.",35 people found this helpful

"Kindle Paperwhite Signature Edition (32 GB) – With a 6.8"" display, wireless charging, and auto-adjusting front light – Without Lockscreen Ads – Black",1.0,Trying to Return or Exchange to No Avail,"Reviewed in the United States on August 20, 2022",Color: Black | Option: Without Kindle Unlimited,True,"Edit No. 2:I see this product has been reduced for the promotion period and frankly I would rather return it for an exchange on a Fire 8 HD Plus but I can't get an actual human being at customer service.  So, down to one star.  I rarely use it because the screen resolution is so bad.  I think that some of these rave reviews might not be genuine.  Beware.October edit:I have reduced my number of stars from 3 to 2 after using this product for a couple of months. The best thing I can say is that the battery is very good and reading in the sun with or without sunglasses is absolutely outstanding. However, the screen is totally glitchy. As others have mentioned you can touch to turn the page and it will jump ahead one or five or 10 pages and any amount of trying to figure out what you’re doing wrong is futile.In my original review I expressed concern about the brightness of the screen and the fuzziness of the printing. I find this more than annoying. I never use this product to read on unless I am in bed in the dead of night, or sitting outside in the sun. Those 2 situations represent barely 10% of the time that I read. I am back to reading on my iPhone or my iPad and I intend to buy a new Kindle Fire or possibly a refurbished small iPad to use just for reading. The Kindle app is excellent and frankly works better than the Paperwhite itself so I am not concerned about how it will perform on other devices. Please read all of the reviews and carefully weigh what you value about your electronic reading device. Screen clarity is extremely important and this product simply does not have that and the user interface is just nuts.When my beloved Kindle Fire started dying I decided to move over to the Paperwhite Signature Edition because of all the hype and good reviews. I read on my iPad Air and I just needed a tool for reading that was smaller and easier to carry around.Two things I absolutely hate-first, the screen is dull even with the “warmth” setting turned all the way down, it’s poorly back lit and that is with the light turned all the way up as bright as it will go. I would hate to see what it does on its own with the auto adjust feature. As others have said, I turned that off first thing. Dark mode is awful in my opinion. I also think the text is not as crisp and I experimented with fonts and bold settings.Second, getting a toolbar or dialog box up to make changes or bookmark a page or get to Home takes more than one step, is not intuitive (Swipe up? Swipe down? Tap corner? Pick pick pick). Give us a toolbar that is in one place with one tap. This has always been an issue with Kindle product but on this device it is particularly goofy.Also, when I am reading and turn the page it will often jump to dark mode on its own and then return to light mode.The monochromatic scheme would not be so annoying if the screen was brighter but looking at the black and white book covers on the Home Screen, you can barely read them. I understand part of the deal with this device is no color but that is a deal breaker.As others have said there is no way to just turn off Wi-Fi, you have to use airplane mode.  Annoying.Two good things, the battery life is outstanding if you turn off Wi-Fi. And it’s petite size is perfect for one-handed reading in bed and it fits in just about any handbag and most pockets so you can read it in places (waiting rooms, lines, public transportation) where you might read on your phone so eye strain might be reduced. The water resistance is not a feature I care about.I would return it but it was a gift from my husband. I did get a swell cover for it which I recommend…https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09LH4NXKC?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details.If you love your Kindle Fire, love your iPhone and iPad you will not like this.

So I decided to do the trade in service. (I didn't realize there was going to be an update of the software) I was able to get some money back from it so that I can get the new version of the paperwhite signature. The page turning is really love the page turning system. It's fast and so far I don't have that page turning glitch I have heard about. I don't mind the heaviness of the kindle, it's not too heavy for me. I was waiting 3 months for the kindle, and I finally received it about three days ago. I love the black ink and I do really enjoy the warmth feature instead of the normal light. I have the warmth feature not too high.The best part of it was setting it up. Because I had a kindle before, I was able to set up with my wifi, and not having to sign in was awesome. For some reason, the update took a while to pop up in my kindle. If I didn't know about the update, I wouldn't have known to update it. But I finally managed to update it. I love the USB-C feature, but kind of wished that the other side of the USB-C cable was a USB-C not a regular USB for people like me who have the new Mac. (Luckily I had extras).I love the update even though like I said it took a while to pop up. There are two ways to go to the library screen, and once the kindle is open there are two ways to turn off the kindle as well. I love how simple the new update is!So far I have no pros and cons list.

So I DEFINITELY needed an update! The thing took forever to charge and died within a few hours of use. This new kindle signature edition was a God send! I miss the colored screen. But I don't mind it that much that this is a black and white e-reader. It's well responsive! The set up and transfer of all my books (10 years of books) was done within a few minutes. Just had to login to my kindle email. Now the battery life is GREAT! But it's not 10 weeks worth of battery life if you're an avid reader. I read a couple hours a day on average. The battery lasted me exactly 3 weeks before it needed a new charge. And I'm not mad at it! I can live with 3 weeks of charge cause that's AMAZING! Now if you read less often then you may get more battery life out of it then I did. Overall, this was a much needed upgrade and the best decision I've made. Highly recommend it if you are looking to upgrade or want one! So good!",3 people found this helpful

I've read the heck out of my Kindle Paperwhite, thanks to Kindle freebies and library check-outs, and have built up a lot of ""to be read"" books on my Kindle. I decided to take advantage of the Prime Day deal and upgraded to the Kindle Paperwhite Signature Edition. I got it set up yesterday and started reading on it immediately. The adaptive lighting is a great feature - I went from regular white light during the day to a warm, amber light when I was reading in bed with the lights out. The solid screen front is a nice update too, because it never failed that I would get one of my dog's hairs caught in the offset edge of the screen and the bezel of the Kindle. Not a big deal in the grand scheme of life, I know, but still. Not sure if I'll utilize the wireless charging feature, but it may come in handy.All in all, I'm happy with my upgrade to the Paperwhite Signature.",

I had gotten this e-reader not just because the e-ink and front light are suppose to protect our eyes.  I hope it does.  I had read on the Amazon web site that it could be used for both kindle books and audible books.  However, they failed to mention that it is only the audible books which you have purchased.  You can not access any audible plus books.  I do not understand why the e-reader can not be made where readers can use the e-reader for both their kindle unlimited accounts as well as their audible plus accounts.  E-readers should not be competing in a matter where readers can only read specific books.  When readers buy a paperback or hard print book in a store;  no matter who published, printed or wrote the book they are able to read them anywhere or anytime.  Also, who wants a radio without speakers?  It is the same with e-readers.  Readers want them made with speakers and wired headphones/earplug jacks.  (Some of us refuse to use bluetooth earplugs for fear of brain cancer.)  Also, the device should come with everything needed for it to be used such as charging cable and plug.  No one wants to pay for an unfinished product or half of one.  Customers can always buy a different cable, plug or charger if needed but these should be provided with purchase so product is usable.  Companies can compete by improving their devices so that they offer more and better features and services such as color e-ink and larger sizes of e-readers.  That being said the kindle paperwhite e-reader is a fairly nice e-reader with quite a few settings.  Although it does not rotate or flip pages automatically; it does have a page orientation setting and just use your finger to flip pages.  There are numerous settings for font type, size, theme, light adjustments and etc.  Although you can not currently download your library app;  “Libby” does offer letting you download and read your books on your kindle e-reader at checkout.  However, the kindle paperwhite has no color like the Libby app so everything will be in black and white.  Also, do not attempt to clean/disinfect the back black plastic of the e-reader with alcohol as it stripped the glossy shiny coating off mine. (Maybe I will try metal frame and backing next time.)",3 people found this helpful

But that’s the only weird thing I have noticed about it. It’s more likely to happen if I’m sitting in a well lit room then a dark one. I suppose this model supports audible, but I haven’t used that feature yet as I prefer to read my books instead of being read to.I kept the 2015 model, as it still works, it just has trouble turning on and the lights working right on it.

The Oasis. and now this new Paperwhite Signature edition.The Paperwhite was amazing, and fully sold me on the technology. Its like glimpsing at the future. Battery life measured in weeks. Screens that only ever get easier to read. Images that actually look like drawn images rather than a jpg because of the screen. It hooked me. It broke, but ill never forget the experience.The Oasis took me out of the market completely. It had everything I wanted, except for the battery life. Having to charge it every day meant its battery would quickly begin to degrade (as all lithium batteries do), if I used it which I never did, because it charged slowly and drained quickly. Why ever pick it up? The page turn buttons are a good sell but not at the expense of weeks of battery. If this thing had the battery of a paperwhite, or a little worse, there would be nothing better. But it doesnt, so dont buy it.The Paperwhite Signature Edition is everything I loved about the paperwhite, with a screen like the Oasis (the extra however many lights make no difference), the performance of the oasis, and a wireless charging dock to give it a home in the house. It does not have page turn buttons, but those are an extreme luxury (for some reason, it cant be expensive to add in a factory) and don't make much of a difference to the experience.Honestly has returned me to the market for these.",5 people found this helpful

I love the screen. It’s awesome, but that’s not surprising because 300ppi is still great. But I still think the Basic’s screen is still good. Sorry, not sorry. With that said I wouldn’t want to switch back and forth between 167ppi and 300ppi. It’s gotta be one or the other. The size of the screen was what really appealed to me and that’s why I wanted to upgrade. But I wouldn’t have if this weren’t a gift. I’m very selective about where I spend my tech money. I love the contrast on the 11th Gen. I love the contrast of my Basic and that’s the standard for me. I personally didn’t like the contrast of the 10th Gen Paperwhite.Dark Mode and warm light are everything! I seem to be in the minority, but I love the auto-light sensor. I think it works very well. I have no complaints thus far.I’m so glad the Kindle logo isn’t white. I wish it were a shade or two darker, but overall I’m very happy. People may think I’m ridiculous, but I would’ve sent it back if the logo was white. I absolutely hate the white logo on the 10th Gen Paperwhite.The screen is a fingerprint magnet. I will miss my Basic Kindle’s screen. It just takes forever to see smudges on it. I feel like if you look at these flush screens wrong you’ll have nothing but smudges.🤣 Again, this isn’t a big deal because I knew it was going to be this way. I always have a cleaning cloth near me and I can’t see the smudges while reading anyway. It’s still annoying though.I love that the USB C port is centered on the device.

Not sure how I missed this, but obviously I didn’t read the description well. So, yes, I’m disappointed. But not enough to return as I can’t live without one. It is faster and a bit bigger reading area. But worth $189?  I think it’s overpriced.",2 people found this helpful

I downloaded some of the books I have on my original Kindle and I did like that I was able to group together by authors in my library but everything is in black and white so was not pleased with the visabilty of the screen and the books are so small, it's hard to find which I would like to read next - I was questioning my eye sight because the covers of the books with not only being black and white but seem blurry - not sure what that is all about - I thought I needed new glasses but just had my eyes check 2 months prior so cannot be the problem ... Mind you I have over a 1000 books in my library since I only use the Fire HD for reading so a large pain in the neck in finding a certain book.. I guess I am so used to the original Kindle Fire HD I have been using where once I purchase a book, it shows up on the first screen in color and easy to see and find books in my library.. Since I am home, I am back to downloading books to my original Kindle Fire HD regretting that I spent all of that money and I have been reading again from my original (only replaced it due to I was leaving for vacation this summer and after owning my original Kindle for 9 years, the battery life only lasts a couple of hours - other than that - a perfect Kindle)..I also had issues of the screen freezing for some reason so would have to turn off and on again to get it going and search for the book I was reading again.....Plus I accidently turn the page too high up near the top of the kindle and down drops the menu screen which for some reason I do alot.. Very frustrating...With being a big time reader and rather read every night before going to bed or if I happen to wake up during the night, usually around 3:30am, I read again for a while to fall back to sleep.. At night would place on the black screen but somethimes when turning the page, there is a flash of white before it turns dark again... I'm sure that isn't the greatest for your eyes...Was now thinking of purchasing another kindle - possibly the new Kindle Fire HD 8 tablet coming out middle of October .. As stated in my heading, I keep trying to Love this Kindle BUT can't stand it...Would like to return the Paperwhite but when I click on the 20% off trade in button, the Paperwhite is not even on my list of choices.. It is showing one of the Kindles that was purchased for a grandchild and my original Kindle Fire HD (certainly not parting with my trusty ""Old Faithful"" Kindle)..I am afraid to spend more money again and be disappointed...Does anyone have advice on which direction to go if I decide to purchase another??? regards, HeidiUPDATE:... Received an email from Amazon wanting to talk about my problem and dislike - communicated through emails and was told I can always do a trade-in on the New, barely read on Kindle.. (possibly only 10 books).. Paid $185.89 with tax ($175.37 exclusive of tax) including cover and charging dock..Will only return anywhere from $5 to $30 on a Amazon credit pus 20% off if purchase another kindle (maybe another $25 credit?)...SO IF ANYONE DECIDES TO NOT LIKE THEIR NEW KINDLE, BE SMARTER THAN ME AND RETURN WITHIN THE 30 DAYS ALLOTTED TIME FRAME....Amazon - that is bit of a disappointment to your customers..",29 people found this helpful

I upgraded from the old 5th generation, so that makes a huge difference.(Let's see about the battery life, but I have my hopes up.

So far the Auto brightness sensor worked for me well, so overall The screen is amazing. Also, finally, we got USB-C!I think it works really well in daylight, there is no glare or fingerprints that I noticed on the screen. However,  I tried using it without the background lights at night with my bedside lamp and there is minimal glare, and you can see fingerprints from using the touch screen from some angles, which was a bit of a turn off for me, and it really makes me miss the page-turning buttons, but once I adjusted the brightness, or better, turned off the lamp, it was not annoying.Overall it is a great device, and all the above inconvenience is not a big deal, but honestly.... Why on earth would you put that power button there?! Am I the only one who likes to rest their pinky there?! I mean, ok, I already got used to the power button being there since it was the same on the 5th generation, but come on! After all these great upgrades, why?!

Newest OS SUCKS,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on March 22, 2022",Color: Black | Option: Without Kindle Unlimited,True,"The Kindle device is great - awesome battery life, tons of storage, easy to handle, and so much better than my old Oasis.  Device gets 5 starts.However, the latest OS version sucks. OS gets 0000 Stars-The endless scroll in the library is useless when you have a large number of books and want to quickly navigate to a certain area - the page numbers (in library, not books themselves) were much easier for navigation.-There are ""ghost"" books - you tap to download a book, it says it queued, looks like it downloads, and poof - looks like it never downloaded.  However, if you search for the title, you now have 2 versions of the book.-Collections do not show or act as they did in previous versions.  Not a big deal for me but in the Unofficial Kindle Help Facebook Group, it's the primary complaint.-Why are there thumbnails of the covers in list mode?  The Kindle is much less responsive in list mode with the covers than in previous OS versions with no covers.  And they take up more space so you get fewer titles showing in list view.-Not all covers download and show.  Not a big deal before when you didn't see covers in List view in previous version but is annoying now.Suggestion for future - have ""not downloaded"" as a filter.  I like having all my books downloaded so a filter to see which titles haven't been downloaded would be a huge plus.",One person found this helpful

I'm always going back and forth, trying to get back to where I was reading. Some reviewers really dislike the power button at the bottom, but I haven't found this to be a problem. My Kindle is protected by a cover, which keeps the power button from sticking out so far, and I haven't hit it by mistake.I am disappointed that you can no longer turn off Popular Highlights as a general setting -- you have to turn them off for each and every book. This is really annoying, as I find the highlights distracting. I wish Amazon had preserved the option to turn them off for everything.

I read for over an hour everyday sometimes much longer.  So I am impressed with the battery. This has a c plug in which works with all my other electronics.  Which wasn't a deal breaker with my oasis.  The browser on this works and connects to wifi so much better and easier than my oasis which said the browser was experimental. This is a bit smaller than the oasis but not by much and honestly you don't miss when you start reading.

The Voyage has always been my favorite, but this new one is pretty spectacular.I'm on week 5 and have not charged it yet and I'm a heavy reader, minimum of 1 hour per day.  I previously returned the 1st version of the Oasis because I couldn't make it more than 2 days without having to charge it and that was unacceptable for how much I read.  My Voyage gets a good 2 or 3 weeks between charges.  This new Paperwhite is even better than that.I saw complaints about the position of the power button.  I do agree, different placement of this button would be better, but so far I've only accidentally turned it off once.  I don't know if this is because I have a cover on it or not.The only thing I've missed from the Voyage is the haptic page turn buttons and only when I want to go back a page but this is minor and I'm adapting to it.I did expect it to be faster on the responsiveness but it's pretty much the same as my voyage.  It's fine for page turning, but if you are searching the store or when waiting for the book to open, it's slower than I thought it would be.  Again, not horrible, just thought it would be better.While I haven't charged it yet, I did put it on my wireless charger to make sure it would pick up with the cover on and that seems like it's going to be a pretty slick feature to have that I'm looking forward too.I would definitely buy this one again and would recommend it.",2 people found this helpful

The brightness and warmth adjustment make the screen very easy on the eyes regardless of the ambient light around you.

The auto adjust lighting is very gentle so you can move from room to room, notice that the brightness shifts but it does so gently and slowly so not to stagger the eyes. The screen is crisp and there is a few options to change font size and style to add to the ease of reading. The only issue that I have is that the tap function to turn pages doesn't always work and that you have to do so in the right area or worry about triggering other options and pop ups, distracting from the book you are reading. Its a good little reader with only one flaw... no button to turn the page. Also, the model isn't that easy to hold. Think deeply about getting a cover that will give some kind of strap or handle if you wish to avoid hand cramps. If it had that, then I would give this a 5 star.",One person found this helpful

Some people like to complain.So I’ve upgraded from the 2018 PW.Here is what’s different:- it’s physically bigger, so old cases won’t fit.- the button is still on the bottom; not once in three years, I’ve accidentally turned off the kindle.- the red / amber light is great for reading at night.- the automatic brightness works most of the time. If you set the brightness manually, it may get stuck there but turning it off / on again will solve this.- the page animation is nice.- the screen looks a bit sharper. Not by much though.- the speed is well improved. It’s maybe twice as fast.- the 6.8 screen makes a minor difference, or at least it seems that way.- nice that it has usb c.- haven’t tried wireless charging.- had some problems updating the firmware but overnight it updated by itself.- battery life lasts a lot more than my old PW (which I’ve used for three years).- feels good in the hand.So yes. It’s an Oasis without the page turn buttons. You can buy it now with peace of mind.",7 people found this helpful

Then if I'm reading I have to wait after touching the top of the screen if I want to go back to my library. It's the same with going into the Kindle store. Other than that it's great. I've charged it once three days ago and I've just now reached 75%. I'm trying to see how many days before it gets into the single digits before I charge it again. Download speeds are good, and turning the pages there's no waiting at all. I read that a lot of people have issues with the power button being on the bottom of the screen but it doesn't bother me. I guess my finger placement is just naturally different than theirs. I turned my Kindle to night mode to help with my eyes and they don't get strained from reading for long periods of time anymore, and for this book lover that's the best.",

No more eye aches from the blue light! Not to mention they finally introduced Dark Mode with white text on black background, which is even better for reading in the dark.The screen and device are the perfect size and weight.No more bezel for lint and pet hair to get caught under.My favorite feature is the ability to disable the touchscreen (found in the top right ellipses menu while reading a book) which still allows you to swipe for page turns but you can bump the screen or even intentionally put your thumb directly on the screen without activating any menus or accidentally highlighting words. My dog straight up licked the screen and the page didn't turn!Though it's not a new feature I do love the ability to connect Bluetooth headphones or speakers for listening to my Audible collection.

I love that you can connect your account to good reads! This is my first kindle (I had a nook before for many years) and I prefer the kindle. I actually am able to read 10x more on the kindle because it’s so lightweight and you can sit comfortably however you’d like to read longer and faster.

"Kindle Paperwhite Signature Edition (32 GB) – With a 6.8"" display, wireless charging, and auto-adjusting front light – Without Lockscreen Ads – Black",3.0,Web Browser Is a Joke,"Reviewed in the United States on March 21, 2022",Color: Black | Option: Without Kindle Unlimited,True,"The Good -1) Size is ideal ... perfect combination of being relatively small, thin, and light while still maintaining a large enough size for good readability.2) Has the feel and look of a well made, sexy product.3) Page turning function works nicely. Just swipe right to go to the next page, and swipe left to go back a page.4) Good menus for customizing font size, print boldness, back lighting, and brightness.The Bad -1) WEB BROWSER/INTERNET IS A JOKE. They indicate it is an ""experimental browser"". What in the hell does that mean??? I'll tell you - it means that it barely works or doesn't work at all. I mean, why would any REAL company, especially one as big as Amazon release such a utter piece of crap. I realize a browser is not the primary thrust of this product, but come on Amazon, if you can't develop a reliably working feature, just leave it out altogether. Don't mislead and frustrate your customers by incorporating a have-baked ""experimental"" internet browser in order to sell the product. BTW, I was a early adopter of Kindle back in 20012 that had a browser that was infinitely better than this piece of crap.2) Downloading ebooks and audio books from your local library is very difficult if not impossible. You certainly can't do it directly from the Kindle due to the worthless internet browser discussed above. Supposedly you can download them to your phone first, and then synch your Kindle to your phone, but I was not able to get this to work after making a reasonable effort. I'll give this product the benefit of the doubt and assume that with enough effort this can be done but it certainly isn't intuitive.Summary - if you have lots of money and are ok with exclusively downloading expensive books from Amazon and doing nothing more, I would definently recommend this product, but if you would like to access free books from your local library, and/or occasionally surf the internet, download basic apps, or get emails, look elsewhere.3)",4 people found this helpful

"Kindle Paperwhite Signature Edition (32 GB) – With a 6.8"" display, wireless charging, and auto-adjusting front light – Without Lockscreen Ads – Black",2.0,"Truly think about what experience you want, convenience from a tablet, or a book?","Reviewed in the United States on January 4, 2022",Color: Black | Option: Without Kindle Unlimited,True,"I just bought a paperwhite (Dec 2021), my Samsung tablet drowned :-( and it kinda freaked me out that I didn't have my book.... lol. Thank goodness for the kindle app on my phone, bought me some time. I decided to take the plunge and get a paperwhite - no glare!!So, I have had a Kindle Paperwhite 32 GB $139 Signature Edition for about a week now, I am transitioning from a Samsung Tab A2 (which I loved).Here is my review...1) its awkward to hold as its SQUARE shaped where my Samsung Tab A2 was a rectangle.2) The ON button is small, like tiny, and on the bottom (not digging). Hard to feel for with any finger - I cant tell when I have the button under my finger.3) It doesn't really TURN OFF. it goes into what I call zombie mode, and will put a generic picture or the book cover of what you are reading on the sleep screen. To turn it off you have to hold previously mentioned tiny button and then it asks if you want to Cancel, Restart or Screen Off, not sure it actually turns OFF?4) Turning it back on at this zombie screen = you have to hit that hard to find button again. and because of the awkward size, you have to hold with both hands or it slides away from you. you cant get a grip on it because its too wide. Or at least I cant. Unlike with my Samsung, I just tapped the screen and it would come back on, I miss that.5) Going from a tablet with color - when looking at my book library, to black and white is difficult, I didn't realize that the shopping experience would be affected.6)  I dont see as many books being offered, the screen is small - only 6.8"" I miss having dozens of books being offered up to me.7) The reading page aesthetic is different - and the transition isn't as soft as when you fold one page to another. Whole screen flashes black, and then the words fall into place. Because the screen is so small you finish reading a page fast, regardless how small you make the page. feels like I am constantly having a glare flashing at me... White reading screen it flashes black.  Dark reading screen it flashes white - really distracting.  With the Samsung kindle APP - animation was flawless.8) You need to really consider what you want from this, vs what you want from a tablet. I freaking miss my tablet, you cannot answer email on this... Books only. You cannot do a quick convenient internet search, gotta go to a pc or your phone9) Audible was not evaluated, I use my phones Audible or Chirp apps for this. I did notice though that it synced between audible and the kindle really nicely.  In two of my screen shots you can see its asking me if I want to advance to the most further part I had listened to.OVERALL  - I think its kind of klunky and I am thinking about sending it back. Honestly, its not horrible, but its not wonderful either.  Truly only PRO thing I can think of, is the non-glare and thats really nice. But it doesn't outweigh all the other cons... I'll be your friend and recommend going with a tablet.",18 people found this helpful

"Kindle Paperwhite Signature Edition (32 GB) – With a 6.8"" display, wireless charging, and auto-adjusting front light – Without Lockscreen Ads – Black",2.0,Extremely Disappointed!,"Reviewed in the United States on August 2, 2022",Color: Black | Option: Without Kindle Unlimited,True,"I own the very first and second Kindle and the first Kindle Fire. I absolutely LOVE the first Kindle Fire! Unfortunately, the place where one plugs in the cord to charge it just stopped working. I used to be able to jiggle it and it would work... alas, all good things must end ... and it did. This is why I decided to purchase the Kindle Paperwhite Signature Edition (32 GB) and because it reminded me of the first Kindle. It worked okay the first couple of months then the pages wouldn't turn.. no matter what I tried. I tried shutting it down and restarting it, closing the book completely, and reopening it (now, THAT'S a lot of fun! Try finding your place again!) Eventually, it starts working again... until the next time that is. But wait, there's more....! I have a difficult time reading the small font without my glasses. I always read in bed and do not want to fall asleep with them on.. besides, it's uncomfortable anyway. Of course, you can set the font to a larger size but the largest is still very small and still blurry to read, furthermore.... even though I ""Save"" it before going back to my book, it still somehow manages to change back to the smaller font all on its own...! (Now, what's up with that?)  Next, one must watch where you turn the pages from. You have to be careful not to be too close to the top or you'll end up getting the drop-down menu for your troubles. It can be a hassle but it's not a deal breaker... just annoying. Now, on to the actual ""Homepage"", this shows your library and the books Kindle thinks you might enjoy among other things on that page and are EXTREMELY difficult to make out. The titles and authors are not easy to read even WITH my glasses on. The page itself just seems totally unorganized and helter-skelter. It's as though they are trying to put entirely too much information into too small of a space. As you know, The Paperwhite is in black and white which causes any artwork or photos on the cover of the books to just blend in with any writing ie. the title, and the author's name. Sloppy, sloppy, sloppy. It's just very difficult to read especially for me because I like to read a lot of books from the same author and when you cannot make sense of the artwork and cannot read the title or make out the author's name very well it can become very frustrating! So, when I think of the money I paid and, it was kind of expensive, I get a bit depressed especially because I've become accustomed to nothing but the best from the Amazon Kindle. Boy, did you guys miss the mark on this one! I hope this helps someone. I am a true, blue Amazon Kindle fan and have been since the very beginning but, this one is just a great big looser!Teri S",3 people found this helpful

I accidently left my original one at a friend's house 2500 miles away from home 7 years ago.  My Kindle Fire gave up the ghost shortly after that.  Since then I've been reading books using the Kindle app on my android phone and my iPad.  It's much more comfortable to read with this new Kindle.I can't rate the battery since I don't know how long it will last for me.  The power adaptor did seem to have the battery charge quickly.However, there is one problem for me.  The time on the Kindle is one hour ahead of real time.  Perhaps it doesn't know that Arizona doesn't have daylight saving time.  I don't see any way of controlling the time.  When reading, especially away from home, I rely on seeing the time on the device that I'm using.Is there any way to change to the correct time?",

I am left handed and cannot turn the page using the left side of the screen. The 2007 Kindle had this feature, and the Oasis, you are able to turn the pages  because you can make the buttons on the left side.3- I hate this new home screen, instead of showing my books, the entire bottom of the screen shows me recommendations.

Extremely inconvenient.  On the Voyage, while reading a book, you just had to tap ""Go To"" to go to a different section of the book.  In the Paperwhite, ""Go To"" is hidden and more difficult to use.  These are not just a case of just needing to learn how to use different navigation, they are cases where navigation is simply more difficult to use.When reading a book on the Paperwhite, certain passages are underlined with a note telling me how many people have highlighted that passage.

The inclusion of a USB-C port is great and just helps to reduce the number of cords that need to be carried around. This device does come with 5 GHz Wi-Fi and the lack of cellular connectivity is alright with me because I know it can be a battery drain. I’m currently using a mission case clear case along with a provided screen protector from mission case that complements this device well! The only weird thing about this device is it doesn’t come with the latest software update that includes the search bar in the top middle and the home and library buttons at the bottom center I reached out to Amazon support and they’ve created a ticket for me and will get back to me regarding this issue. I like that this device came out of the box with no ads however I still think that Amazon should  discontinue charging an extra premium to get rid of the ads.

Since my purchase in late November of last year I have read 50 books. That's forty-five more than my past averages. This Kindle makes it fun, and easy to read. However, one major complaint. And that has to do with the note-taking ability. If someone were to produce something like the Kindle Paperwhite with a note-taking ability that did not feel like you were watching a snail run the 100 yard dash I would buy it today, immediately. It is so frustrating to take notes on this Kindle. If you are in a book where you are taking many notes it may possibly double the time it takes to read the book. Very frustrating.Best investment in a long time. Sixty straight days of reading and twenty-two books read. It seems that over the past 3-4 years it was only 3-4 books a year. The Paperwhite has been a complete joy. I especially like that it constantly shows the percentage read in your current book. What a motivator. I bought the 32GB model. I know I've gone a bit overboard on my book purchases with 761 purchased to date. But hey, it'll hold  ten-thousand or so, so what the hay. Happy reading.",

"Kindle Paperwhite Signature Edition (32 GB) – With a 6.8"" display, wireless charging, and auto-adjusting front light – Without Lockscreen Ads – Black",3.0,Fairly good reader with serious design flaws,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on September 6, 2022",Color: Black | Option: Without Kindle Unlimited,True,There's a lot to like about the Kindle Paperwhite but it fails spectacularly in a couple of ways that detract somewhat from the user experience.The main selling point for a dedicated e-reader is that it is easier to read than a tablet under a wide range of ambient light intensity and the Kindle seems OK from that perspective.A minor flaw is the tendency of the touch screen to sometimes flip multiple pages.  I have not yet determined exactly what gesture causes this but it's a bit frustratingA major flaw that is in my opinion a total design failure is the location of the power button.  What were they thinking?  The power button is on the bottom edge of the Kindle and it is almost impossible to rest the lower edge of the Kindle on a surface (eg: a table or even one's lap) while reading without accidentally turning the thing off.  That part of the design is inexcusable and I find it troubling that this 'feature' has been present in previous models but has not yet been corrected.,

"Kindle Paperwhite Signature Edition (32 GB) – With a 6.8"" display, wireless charging, and auto-adjusting front light – Without Lockscreen Ads – Black",5.0,The best Kindle reader yet.,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on December 18, 2021",Color: Black | Option: Without Kindle Unlimited,True,"I must be honest about the battery. If you use the light (I find the light is useless if it is not on full #24.) the battery will be used up in 8 hours. So I guess if you do not use the light it will last maybe 48 hours which will work great for outdoor, beach reading. Reading anywhere you do not need to use the built-in light.  Also the lights are not any brighter than the 2019 basic Kindle or the 2018 Kindle Paper White.  You will have serious eye strain if you do not have the lights on when using this even with the built-in lights on fully.  The lights on this are not sufficient for reading in the dark. People who say it is great for reading in bed without disturbing your spouse will go blind trying to read in the pitch dark with the weak lights on this or any other Kindle reader.  If you want to read in bed with no lights you will need to use the Kindle app on your phone or tablet computer.  With adequate external lighting this Kindle is great for reading a huge improvement over every other Kindle reader.",
"Kindle Paperwhite Signature Edition (32 GB) – With a 6.8"" display, wireless charging, and auto-adjusting front light – Without Lockscreen Ads – Black",5.0,Great upgraded version of a kindle,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on January 4, 2022",Color: Black | Option: Without Kindle Unlimited,True, This is such an upgrade for the kindle. Wireless charging and they finally upgraded the charging port to usbc! Plus ad-free is just integrated into this model? Awesome. I love it!Screen quality is nice. It will be easy to read on. Brightness is adjustable and also has an auto adjust setting.I love the fact that it’s waterproof.Touch screen has a slow-ish response time but I think that’s a result of the screen type(being that it’s an e-reader and not iPhone or iPad or android phone or something like that). Swiping almost feels like the page is turning and is not a fluid sliding motion.The only two downsides are that the lock button is on the bottom of the kindle (kind of a weird design choice) and the kindle had to go through an upgrade the second I set it up to get the latest user experience (and thank god it did update because the new experience is MUCH better than the one initially on the kindle) however it was weird the brand new kindle didn’t just come with the latest software. The experience on this kindle is very similar to the kindle app for your phone. But this screen is meant for reading.,62 people found this helpful

The processing speed is somewhat lacking, noticed it during setup, but this is a non-issue when reading books & frankly I'm hoping a dulled processor also means a better battery life. It almost has to. Right?USB-C....finally. I even emailed Amazon about this, let microUSB die! Less cables, less fuss...USB-C. This is long overdue, everybody knows it, enough said.They got rid of the lifetime basic internet connection. I tried to buy it & couldn't. Pretty sad, and that's my '1 step back' part. I hate anything that takes value, options away from the consumer.At the same time, 5 steps forward. A net gain of 4, which needs to be celebrated. This Kindle has a lot of good things, and if you're like I was, holding back & punishing manufacturers for continuing to use microUSB & other dumb things...now's a good time to stop.

As much as I love the feel of reading a physical book, I can't argue with the convenience of buying/renting digital books. Prior to my Kindle, I'd been reading ebooks through my library and I wasn't sure if the kindle was worth the investment when I could just read on my phone or iPad. Let me tell you, I have no regrets; the screen is much easier on the eyes and it's nice to have a separate device for reading. You don't have the distraction of other apps or notifications popping up while you're reading. The battery life is great! And it's so worth getting Kindle unlimited. Now I'm reading constantly and I love the convenience of being able to finish a book and immediately start the next in a series no matter where I am without lugging around a bag full of books.

All of the new features are also great. I am not a fan of the most recent OS update for kindle, but that's not the device's fault.I deducted two stars, though, because these units have some serious quality control issues. I received one of these for christmas, and noticed right away that the right side of the device was a little loose. If you pinched it, you could feel it flex and hear it creak. It wasn't bad and didn't cause screen distortion at that time, so I decided to keep it. Within the next 3 months, though, with VERY gentle use (It stays on my night stand and I read a bit before sleep. That's all the use it has gotten) - it got much worse and did begin to distort the screen. I contacted amazon and they shipped me a replacement. The replacement has the same issue, but not as bad as the original kindle was on day 1. I'm hoping this one won't get worse over time, too, but I suspect it will.

This Kindle is everything I desire in an ereader: all controls are an easy tap on the screen, page turning, returning to library, word definitions, bookmarking, smooth and as simple as a tap. The reading experience is completely uninterrupted.  Screen size is perfect, weight is comfortable for holding book while lying down as well as when sitting.  Library scrolling is simple and easily and quickly filtered to my preference, important since I have a large library.  Worth buying without ads to enjoy reading and nothing else.  Took just a few minutes to familiarize myself with the improvements and better features and controls.  The paperwhite light adjusts intelligently without me having to bother with it.  Definitely my favorite of all the Kindles I have tried or own. An avid reader's delight.",4 people found this helpful

This means that if you're travelling and the wireless network or hotspot available to you no longer uses the WPA2 encryption standard, you will be unable to connect your kindle device to the wireless networks that use the newer WPA3 standard (which I believe has been around since 2018). Chances that hotspots and access points at your airport or hotel uses the older standard is slim, given the new standard has been available for almost 5 years at this time. If you cannot connect, you cannot download new books on the go. This is a major painpoint that has frustrated my wife, who I bought this device for.

But I'm getting older, and wanted something a bit bigger, a bit more modern to enjoy my evenings reading. The new Paperwhite looked all fancy; Type-C and wireless charging, 6.8 screen, waterproof, all that cool stuff. So I bit into the hype and picked one up.Unfortunately, it's almost instant regret from me. The screen is SO washed out and almost blurry, compared to my pinsharp Voyage. They both have 300 resolution, but it seems the quality of the screen is much higher with the Voyage. I realise the Voyage was a premium product, but it's been so long since it was released, I figured the screen from that device would at least be replicated on the Paperwhite Signature, if not improved.I didn't buy from Amazon US (I don't live in the US, so had to import from a third party seller) so I've no option to return. All I can do is put this warning out to others. If you are a first time buyer, or coming from another Paperwhite, you may be happy with how it looks. But if you have a Voyage, I'd definitely recommend staying with that until they release something equally good to replace it, because the Paperwhite Signature most definitely will not.UPDATE: So after changing the settings many times, and downloading new fonts, I have made the screen 60% better, in terms of clarity and readability. I would say, I still don't think it's as good as my Kindle Voyage, but it is much better than it was before, and it's much easier to read. Is the Signature version worth the extra money? No, the extra functions aren't worth the extra charge, hence 3 stars not 4, but it's OK, I have it now and I'm comfortable to read on it.",38 people found this helpful

While it works well once I have the book, it is a confusing nightmare to get the books onto the Kindle and then again to return them. The book has to be located in the library's software, then taken out, then a special link clicked which takes one to Amazon to download it. Returning or renewing a book is still more complicated, and most of the time, there's no way I can find to get the book out of my Kindle's Library. If I take out a book a second time, the Kindle says the loan is expired until I go through a complex process on my computer (not the Kindle!) to re-enter it the loan into the Kindle's Library.Why this is so convoluted and always requires at least two devices and two or three different sites or software packages is beyond me. I suspect that it's because Amazon wants you to buy books -- and they make that easy -- rather than take them out from your library.The device is great for reading once a document is on it, but a hot mess if you want to take books from the library.",

Kindle paper whites are more specifically for reading than the others (in my opinion). I have had a handful of kindle fires in the past and they all worked well. I did all the research I could on the different kindles before choosing this one as the one for me. It worked very well for the first several weeks, and then the screen started glitching. I haven't dropped it and it has never been outside of the case. I don't eat and read (a first, but I don't want to get the screen greasy and dirty). This is probably my best-kept electronic (even before my work laptop). But somehow, the screen got messed up and so if I have to set it down for a moment (on a flat surface) and don't close the flap on my case, I come back and unlock it to a glitch on the screen that sometimes moves me several pages forward. Most recently it has made me skip whole chapters and has zoomed out my pages. It also highlights and selects words and at times sentences and won't let me click off of whatever is selected.Honestly, I maybe should've stuck with the kindle fire or reading on my phone. I don't get as many headaches after switching to the PaperWhite, but the glitch is making it less enjoyable for me to read.",One person found this helpful

Sadly I went with the wrong one. This one does not allow you to easily hold it while you read. Unless you get your fingers just right you'll end up either advancing pages or going back pages. That is really REALLY annoying and no matter how many times i remind myself to only hold it on the very edge, i find myself having the same issue again and again. So if your considering buying this version, reconsider unless you have tiny baby size fingers.The battery life is very good and the readability is really good too.  I have started getting books to add to my library but the kindle app and manageability is another hit against this product.If you want to really manage your library you'll want to look into something like Calibre which is MUCH MUCH easier and intuitive to manage books with. The kindle app is just a pain to work with and its NOT user friendly nor is it at all intuitive.",

The feature I was most excited about was the wireless charging - the idea of my book propped up, fully charged, always waiting to be read was irresistible.The wireless charging is nice, I’ll admit.Holding it is the problem. As one of the most “First-World” of “First-World Problems”, I can't hold this model of Paperwhite comfortably with one hand, which is a deal-breaker. Most of my reading is in bed, with the backlight on “1”, and I enjoyed the warmer light option with this model even though you really can’t tell a difference when there’s so little light. Although the specs show this to be a little over an ounce heavier than my Oasis, it felt like so much more, especially without a way to hold it comfortably. (The cork cover made it quite heavier, too, so that wasn’t the answer.) I even looked into straps to make it easier but when I picked up my Oasis again, it was a no-brainer. This Paperwhite went back. I fully realize now how special my Oasis is and as long as it holds a charge long enough for say, a long car ride or day at the beach, I’ll learn to be satisfied with the battery life.",

I am a device junkie so this is not something I should have a hard time with. BUT. I already had an older Paperwhite. I had two reasons for being interested in this one: I can switch the background to black, with white print, for reading at night with the lights out, and to have a screenreader in the paperwhite instead of having to use the Kinde Fire when I want to listen. The Fire screenreader is easy and fine but I have sleep problems. I work with people who have disabilities and I am well aware of the need for accessibility features for people with visual impairments. However, the speech to text feature on this is completely designed for people with visual impairments and there are multiple multiple steps and taps and clicks to get it to work.  I like to be able to sit and read, and then if I need to get up and do some boring task, continue to ""read"" by switching to screenreader mode. This is accomplished in about half a second with the Fire. With this paperwhite, there are multiple steps, annoying clicks which are useful for the visually impaired, but there is no option for people without a visual impairment to quickly and easily switch to screen reader mode. For that matter - I went through an illness causing complete blindness and then gradually improving vision over several months, so I know what I am talking about: if I were in that situation now I would just use the Kindle Fire I got around 2014, learn how far from the bottom of the screen I need to tap to switch to speech-to-text mode and that's that.  Easy peasy. This Signature Paperwhite is easy UNTIL you try to change any setting or switch to the screen reader. In fact a person with a significant visual impairment would need major assistance from a sighted person to not just to set up, but continue to navigate this device, the accessibility menu is a farce. Turning the page is easy but going into menus the screen's sensitivity is variable, sometimes responsive and sometimes not. I wanted to love this but... looks like I will use it at night in bed and go back to the Fire for text to speech. New software should make things EASIER not harder. I cannot begin to tell you how bad the instructions and navigation are on this. Considering returning.",2 people found this helpful

The Voyage was the right weight for my small hands and had tons of features. But Amazon, in their profit-driven wisdom, decided that model needed to be retired. The Paperwhite isn’t too bad. It’s larger and heavier and when you turn the page, you may find that a random number of pages have actually turned, and you have to search for your place. My main complaint is in the software. I cannot download a book without first rebooting the device. What the heck? I sometimes have a limited amount of time to read, which means I have to plan ahead if I may finish a book during that time. I don’t always know what I’ll be in the mood for next.

I love the size and enjoy using it for reading, BUT on this device, you cannot remove the book cover without permanently deleting the book, and then you must repurchase it if you decide to reread it. Even if you add them to collections the cover of the book stays on the home page. So that means you have to scroll through the home page for books you purchased but have not read when you are ready to read one. My old kindle lets you remove the download from the device and remove books off the home page without permanently deleting them.

The material soaks in your oils I guess and leaves the back looking not so nice… The picture I’ve attached is after using a wipe (mom of 3 👋) on it. I know, a case! I plan on purchasing one.

I could understand it needing to occasionally do an update, but this happens in the middle of reading a book - and then it loses track of where it was, often returning me to where I read 50-70 pages ago.Not anxious to go back to reading on my larger iPad but at least it's reliable.",

I have had several Kindles, the second generation Kindle, a Paperwhite, a Voyage and then the 2018 Paperwhite. I love books, physical and digital. My preference for reading is always a Kindle since it can hold so many books. I was always frustrated however, by the slow interface. It took forever (well, it felt like forever) to turn on and load my book, turn pages and highlight text. I often would use my iPad or my phone to read since they were so much more responsive.  Well, no more. This new version of the Kindle (on top of having a larger reading area which is actually quite nice) is a LOT faster and much more responsive.  I am very much enjoying reading my books again on the Kindle.If you are considering a Kindle and you don't have one yet, BUY THIS.

I strongly encourage Amazon to improve the experimental browser.  I only use the WiFi/cellular for downloading books or Wiki definitions.

The animation is smoother moving from one page to another and the Kindle itself is just faster. Moreover, the page flip animation is so fluid.I have to say that I love this new Kindle.

I have gigabit Wi-Fi all over my house, and the device takes several minutes to download audio narration for a file. The interface is incredibly unintuitive. Settings which should be at a readers fingertips are hidden under various sub menus, with no way to figure out how to get to them other than googling “how do I activate X feature on my Kindle?”I had a simple question regarding how to read a book while playing the narration at the same time. It’s a feature that is offered on the Kindle app, so it made sense that it should also be available on a full kindle device.  However, after being transferred between six different customer service representatives, not a single one of them was able to even make the slightest headway on the problem. One of them offered me directions to the Kindle app, which were obviously not relevant. Others told me to click on my screen and go to nonexistent menus, a process made even slower by Amazons ridiculous decision to not allow screenshots during its customer service chats. In the end I gave up, because the bumbling six stooges they sent had the stock reply to every question of “hold on, let me look that up.”  There wasn’t a single “technical service“ rep that had enough knowledge to be able to answer any questions straight up. A slow, laggy, unintuitive device made worse by poor customer service. If I could return it now, I would. Complete disappointment.",3 people found this helpful

When I called the  Kindle support team to arrange a return and replacement they first asked a bunch of questions which basically tried to establish that I had dropped it or in some other way mishandled it. Once that was finished they said they would first test it and try to fix it. I explained that since it failed from the start I wasn’t comfortable with simply having it fixed and that I wanted a brand new one.  I had with them for 15 minutes before they agreed to replace it. I was very disappointed by the customer service workflow and that’s why I can only give it 3 stars. The device itself would get 6 out of 5 stars otherwise.,2 people found this helpful

"Kindle Paperwhite Signature Edition (32 GB) – With a 6.8"" display, wireless charging, and auto-adjusting front light – Without Lockscreen Ads – Black",3.0,Still unreadable if light shining directly on it.,"Reviewed in the United States on November 24, 2021",Color: Black | Option: Without Kindle Unlimited,True,"The responsiveness of the new 11th Generation Kindle Paperwhite is very nice. No waiting when you turn pages or change settings.However, the screen is no more clear than the previous couple of generations. When a light is shining on the screen, you can actually make out the reflection of the source on the screen (light bulb or sun), and it is necessary to change the angle you are holding the device, or your entire reading position, in order to clear the visual disturbance.  This is a regression in light disbursement from the original Paperwhite screen and from that used on the Kindle Voyage. Both of those do a much better job of disbursing the light. I'm guessing they deemed this acceptable because of increased scratch resistance (or similar) of the newer screens. However, since the main point of the product is to allow easy reading in the sun or in rooms with bright lights, this seems a bad trade-off to me. This is the reason I have not bought a new Kindle in many years despite having dropped my previous, non-waterproof version in some water. The only reason this purchase isn't being returned is because I had some gift cards which were paying for a good portion of the price, lowering my personal expense. $180 is way too much for a device that is often still difficult to read.The 32G of storage is nice, though I will likely never use it all.

Getting help with Kindle is a total non-starter, it doesn't exist.

I do like the larger screen, more memory, warm backlight, wireless charging, but the issues that happen during reading are driving me nuts. I expect better. Am knocking off another star, so take note Amazon and get this right.Finally happy but frankly I was shocked that the updated firmware touted as a great feature of this Kindle Paperwhite Signature Edition was not installed and the option to update was greyed out when I received it.

I read a LOT. So I have an extensive book collection.  I “upgraded” from the 7th gen to this because my battery is giving out (the problem with the previous kindles).  I should send this back, but my husband was so happy to buy it for me, I’m keeping it. What I don’t like:1. The screen is actually too big. I’m constantly accidentally barely touching the screen and it flips pages. There’s not enough room on the sides to hold it without touching the screen.2. The screen is tooooo responsive. I remember the 1st kindle without buttons, you had to almost punch the screen to turn the page. Can we have a setting for responsiveness???3. I’ve turned off the auto bright in settings, but it’s not actually turned off. Suddenly my screen gets really bright then dims slowly.4. There is NO way to turn off seeing book covers. I used to see 8-10 books per screen in the library. Now I see 4. If you use collections, you can’t see a list of the books, only the covers. It seriously is a pain to find my next book! Since I have ~300 books to be read, there’s no good way to browse like my last kindle.5. This isn’t Amazon’s fault, but Moko doesn’t make my favorite cover for this model. I had to buy 2 different ones & craft them together. I like the plastic back with a cover that has a stand.6. Yes, the on/off button DOES extend out enough to engage it when standing up. I have lap reader pillow to perch the kindle on, and the button engages every time!Bottom line, I wouldn’t buy this version.

The font must be an 8 or 9, maybe smaller, very faint. Impossible to read easily without a magnifier for people with vision disabilities.

So I manually signed in. My library was there and started downloading. I went to the store to buy some books. Unresponsive screen and false pickups caused me to unintentionally buy a book, then I was able to cancel it. Then I bought some other books. Some showed up in my library, others didn't. Then the device got stuck in a reboot loop. Kept trying to download a book then it rebooted. I had to unregister my device then re-register the device, this time the phone app worked to register it. That fixed the rebooting. Then I couldn't figure out why some purchases weren't showing up. I bought them again and they were marked as already being bought but didn't show up in Kindle. I couldn't for the life of me find order history for any Kindle stuff. Finally in my email I saw my Amazon card flagged it as suspicious and blocked it. After much effort I figured out that the order history has a filter already set to not show digital purchases. Then I set it on the wireless charger to charge and went out to dinner. When I came back the light was no longer solid but flashing and it barely charged.I am hoping that after this rough start the device will be better to actually use than to set up. The slow screen refresh makes it confusing and resulted in accidental purchases. Maybe reading will be better than the store.Update: once the initial issue of it constantly reloading the store then rebooting was solved by unregistering it then re-registering it the store has been usable on it and reading on it is really nice. I would give it 5 stars if the setup went smooth. I do recommend buying it and just be patient with the setup if you also have the software issue and credit card freeze. I am leaving it at one star so people can see the setup experience and know what to do if that happens to them and so they see that it is still absolutely worth getting despite the issues I ran into.",11 people found this helpful

When propped up, changing hands, turning pages etc. the on/off switch randomly turns off as I am reading. I could not even set it up without triggering the bottom button which protrudes almost 0.5mm from the bottom.  If, like me, you had the idea that changing the page orientation might be a solution for the button issue, it is not. The page orientation only allows for the button to protrude from the bottom or the left side.  The open, uncovered (could this really be waterproof?) charging port is next to the button, so charging while reading is almost impossible. It is also more than 1 ounce heavier than the voyage which does not seem like much until you handle it and realize that it not as ergonomic as the voyage and that the device must be held because of the button issue.  Of course, the trade off is the screen, which is almost an inch wider and almost an inch wider than the Voyage.  Unfortunately, bigger is not always better and can be a real disadvantage if you want to throw it in a pocket or purse. The screen is extremely bright and even when changing the “warmth” it is slightly more blue-tinged than the voyage.  I was so excited to finally replace my beloved kindle voyage that is on its last legs, but alas this going to be my back-up travel kindle so I can keep my voyage as long as possible.",566 people found this helpful

Period! …..and by the way….ALL CHARGING METHODS ARE EXTRA!  I have been a longtime Prime member, as I’m constantly being reminded lately with the more frequently I find myself calling Amazon for help, or explanations about how to do things…….They seem to forget….the reason I have been a longtime Prime member is because I’m very old, and never was in a classroom with a computer…and o, by the way Amazon….if you think a something is a simple instruction, you might want to ask your IT people…who just last week told me my question about HOW DO I DISABLE MY ANDROID PROTECTION…(.a requirement to use the Kindle Trade In offer)…..WAS UNFINDABLE!!………Which set in motion a cluster bomb, and lead to them also realizing they have no method to deactivate the $20 credit they applied to my account….with almost 2 hours on the phone….the best CSR could come up with was, “they will figure out you did not return the older Kindle and charge me back the $20”!………Luckily, my husband, not a long time Kindle user is OK….NOT HAPPY mind you, but OK with all the NOT THERE FEATURES…..personally, considering what this thing costs….I’m NOT OK! What the heck happened to Amazon??",8 people found this helpful

It is in color, and looking at the book jackets in color is a delight, and the font is always very black, and it is incredibly fast.

"Kindle Paperwhite Signature Edition (32 GB) – With a 6.8"" display, wireless charging, and auto-adjusting front light – Without Lockscreen Ads – Black",1.0,Software designer doesn't use the Kindle or read many books,"Reviewed in the United States on July 14, 2022",Color: Black | Option: Without Kindle Unlimited,True,"Bought this kindle for my wife's birthday.  This is her 4th kindle.  She's been a user since the very 1st beta version of the Kindle.  She has enjoyed version she's had and happily used them.  She had to adjust to the smaller memory of a Paperwhite.  Now with this Signature Paperwhite she can have more books again.  She reads over 300 new books a year and her electronic book collection is over 8000.  She reads every day.  I lay all of this out to explain why she gave this kindle a 1 star.Whatever developer created this new software that she didn't have upgrade on her 2012 Paperwhite has only 1 goal in mind.  And that isn't to make it easy for a user to find their books and read it. It is purely to SELL BOOKS.  The home page which should be an easy screen to see the books she needs to review (she reviews for several reviewing sites and directly for publishers and authors), instead is focused on recommending books to buy or read.  Books that keep in mind, she has ALREADY READ due to her reviewing or she purchased.She doesn't need recommendations of books.  She needs to work through her books.  With a TBR Pile of over 1600 books and most of those she owns, wasting valuable space on the kindle to show recommendations only irritates her.  This birthday gift which was supposed to be a wonderful gift has now incensed her and she wants to get rid of this new kindle.But wait... there is the ""library"".  This is not intuitive.  So once again, the developer has zero concept of using a kindle for heavy reading.  I did mention she has thousands of books, right?  Whilst the collection feature is nice, she wanted to only load some of her books that she wants to focus on in her library.  Now, random books have been downloaded from our family collection and is cluttering her kindle.  She can't find the book she wanted to read.Before anyone claims my wife is a technophobe, she's in IT and has designed websites, graphical user interfaces (GUI), and other cloud SaaS applications.  Whilst the hardware of this Kindle is great.  The software is absolute garbage and the software development team should either be fired or receive a massive paycut.  Maybe next time, have programmers that are heavy readers actually try and use the software before rolling it out.",53 people found this helpful

"Kindle Paperwhite Signature Edition (32 GB) – With a 6.8"" display, wireless charging, and auto-adjusting front light – Without Lockscreen Ads – Black",3.0,Incompatible with many children's books,"Reviewed in the United States on March 19, 2022",Color: Black | Option: Without Kindle Unlimited,True,There are several features I really like about this model. But one big one I'm really upset about.Pros So many light levels and easily accessed. Huge improvement over the other models I have had. I also really like having the cover of book I'm currently reading as the picture on the lock screen. Being able to access my Goodreads want to read list is a plus. And a really big plus that I haven't tested out yet is the water resistance.Cons I found the older layout easier to manage. Even the Kindle app is easier to find what you are looking for. None of my collections transfered so now I have to remake the collections or learn to live without. But the big glaring change that dropped this two stars for me is that many of the children's books are not compatible with this model. One of the big things I use my kindle for is reading bedtime stories. This model has such great lighting for being able to read in the dark but few of my books are compatible.,

So for adult books, it’s fine (not great, but fine). However, the lack of color makes reading kids books, comics, magazines, news papers, etc not good. For the cost, I would have thought they would have up graded technology that allows for color reading. There are other readers out there that use such technology. I wish I had known that before purchasing this. I will be returning and look for something more advanced with compatibility for all types of reading scenarios.

"Kindle Paperwhite Signature Edition (32 GB) – With a 6.8"" display, wireless charging, and auto-adjusting front light – Without Lockscreen Ads – Black",2.0,Pokey and only good for reading,"Reviewed in the United States on December 8, 2021",Color: Black | Option: Without Kindle Unlimited,True,"I bought this device to alleviate eye strain and I’m comparing it to my experience using an iPad.  So, the paperwhite is basically a book and it has very limited functionality aside from a pure reading experience.  It’s for people who have a few books they are loyally making their way through without interruption.  It has also imported my wishlist as a “reading list”.  That would be fine if I were using the wishlist as an uncomplicated TBR list.  However, I have a KU subscription and usually have 20 books I’m reading, started, or am about to start.  That means I do a lot of looking at book details to remind myself what the book is and where I am in it.  It also means I look for books a lot.  Similarly, I don’t use my wishlist as an uncomplicated TBR list.  I use it as a way to track books in preorder.  So my wishlist is carefully ordered by publication date and I can easily see which book is still in preorder and what has come out.  I also have comments on the books to remind myself what they are and what my thoughts were on the series.  In the Paperwhite, the list order is destroyed and you can’t tell if the book is on preorder or what the publication date is.  You also can’t see the comments you’ve made. So, the reading list is useless for me.  I think it has helped my eye strain.  I can use it when I start binge reading books or series.  That’s good.  But it’s not going to be my favorite device.  It’s like reading glasses.  Something you’d forget, if possible, but are forced to use because your eyes $uck.  If I could configure the Kindle app and my iPad to be better on my eyes, I’d dump this device in a hot second.  As is, I still use it.  Also, it’s crazy slow.",3 people found this helpful

The first computer to display in color was in 1976. By the 1980s anyone could create color images on a computer.

The description did say it was grayscale, but unless you are specifically looking for it, it's easily missed. I have many books in my digital library that are useless if you can't look at the illustrations in color.  Most ironic? Digital photography. I'll now have to buy something else to read those on. It isn't going to be anything Kindle, I promise. My own fault, I know, and I will use it, just would have purchased a small tablet instead had I known about the grayscale only.

I was an early adapter of this e-reader and have adored it over the years. It’s joy was in its simplicity- intuitive to use, quick to switch between store and library. But over the last couple of years it’s become slower, quirkier and clumsier to buy new books or access material you already own. I swear it takes 3-4 more touches to make a purchase than it used to. And it is constantly sending error messages, “Kindle store temporarily not available” and the like. I’d think it was because it was an older device, but I actually own 6 paper white, oasis, and now this 2022 edition. Unfortunately, the older, simpler devices automatically load latest operating versions, so they are uniformly as irritating as the newest version. Screen lighting, battery life, and wireless charging stands are improvements, but actual operating system has gotten worse over time instead of better. It no longer even has a words/list only version so you are forced to see illegible book covers which only serve to take up more screen space and cause you to make more screen swipes.

Decided to just get a new one because if I got a new battery then it quit I would be bummed out. So this was on some sort of sale so I bought it. First of all, seems slow to respond to everything. Thought that was kind of weird since they should have this down by now. If only that was the big issue. Screen often does not respond at all. Trying to go to previous pages is hard, sometimes regular turning page takes several tries. Or maybe the screen freezes completely. When I press the button to restart selecting the restart button doesn't actually do anything so I have to just keep holding the button to force restart. I thought maybe the wifi was causing problems somehow so I turned it on airplane mode and that was even worse. Had to restart repeatedly within a few hours.

I thought I was getting the latest and greatest, but have been so disappointed.  First, it also freezes/goes blank screen way too often. I've only had it a few weeks and I have to restart it several times (and restarting takes forever).  The worst part though, is they took away all of the book organization that I liked.  I got one with tons of storage thinking I could leave all my books downloaded, but it's way too messy now.  Before I kept all of the books that I read over and over downloaded in collections (listed first) so they'd be available even if I was offline (camping, etc). Then all the books that I had downloaded to read or kept for other reasons were listed after the collections. Now, they show up individually in the library even if they're also in collections.  There's no way to 'tuck them away' so it's chaotic and difficult.  It's either remove the download, or have a disaster of a library listing.  What's the point of buying a kindle with extra storage space then??  And just a small thing, but my old library had ""page 5 of 45"" etc when I was scrolling through, and now there's nothing to indicate how many 'pages' are in my library.  If I could buy the same one I got five years ago, I would do that instead after spending a few weeks with this one.",

It will take some hard adjustment as it is a bit of a mystery on how to navigate. Downright frustrating much if the time. Getting to the Home Screen which used to be a click of a button has me swiping nine ways to Sunday in hopes I’ll hit the sweet spot. As usual no printed institutions came with the nearly two hundred dollar device. In addition the older gen didn’t require any Wi-Fi or password another disadvantage I’d say.  On the plus side the screen is larger, you can adjust the back lighting and font size provided you can access the magic swipe.

After you have sold your book collection, and have been using one of these for over 10 years, you are stuck. There are many things to like about this new version. But everyone else has talked about them.This is why I gave this new 2022 iteration a rousing 1 star. There is no cord that comes with this device. If you want the cord that fits the port, you will have to buy one for about $10. This port is different from your other Paperwhite, if you had one, so your old cord and charger will not work. That is listed nowhere in the product description. Moreover, you will also have to buy a charger for another $20. So slap $30 onto the price of this baby.When you do go to purchase said cord and charger, good luck choosing the one that is right for your new device. Amazon has gotten away with one of the most feeble search bars on their website for years. Just try finding the right cord and charger for this new Kindle. You will get pushed a bunch of cords and chargers that are all wrong for you. It took a customer rep from Amazon, and I, about 20 minutes trying to find the right ones. And, honestly, I think we may have gotten it wrong. I went back and ordered a different cord and charger today to be sure. Because I believe he chose the 2021 cord and charger. Even the Employees of Amazon can no longer accurately choose the right products that work with Amazon devices.So, for the inflated price, the ridiculous add-ons, the sloppy marketing and website, and the fact that any customer who reads with frequency will have to buy a new device every 5 years, because their Kindle battery will fail, and has that obsolescence built in, I have subtracted 4 stars. I wish I could have subtracted 10.",22 people found this helpful

However, having owned this Kindle for a month or so, I must say that the font of the new product seems faded and harder to read as compared to my old Kindle; this is true regardless of at what levels the brightness, warmth, and font boldness are set.  I will be keeping the new Kindle as a somewhat expensive backup/repository for my Kindle library (thanks to all that extra storage), and continue using my old one for my everyday reading.

This is fully what I has expected from this kindle! However, there is no way of listening while reading along at the same time on the kindle. I can’t imagine how they are lacking the technology to allow this. I feel I would have been better off using my iPad.I do like the feel of the kindle, the fact it’s waterproof and how easy it is to place in my purse.

It lasted just over a month (we're at the end of February 2022 right now). I'd bought it when my previous Kindle Paperwhite from April 2020 died. When THAT one died Amazon offered me a new one with a 15% discount. I pointed out that it was pretty lame that I was only getting 15% off when the device I was replacing had only lasted about a year and a half. They relented and gave me 30% off. So, I took the 30% discount and bought this Kindle... which has stopped working at just over ONE MONTH OF USE. Amazon is sending me a replacement that won't get here until the end of March or early April. They're giving me a $10 gift card for the inconvenience... ugh. Whatever. There's nothing I can do about it. I'd leave Kindle if I weren't so invested in all of the digital books I own in this format. So, beware: I've had two of these late model, waterproof Kindles crap-out in a pretty short period of time. Amazon has done the bare minimum to make it right. I cannot recommend buying a Kindle Paperwhite. I'm feeling kind of screwed by Amazon right now. Ah well. I hope this helps. Please note: the attached pictures show what my broken Kindle does. It just goes back and forth between the logo screen and a blank screen. I guess it's trapped in some kind of reboot loop. That's it. Ugh.",10 people found this helpful

I went back and forth about purchasing one for years and researched all of them. I finally purchased one, waited forever for it ship, and enjoyed about 4 months of using it. I didn’t use it much as I wound up getting Covid and some other excuses. A few weeks ago, mine bricked itself. It’s stuck on the screen where someone is reading under a tree. No reset, different charger, or any other “solution” I read in any of the support groups or was offered by customer service.I have spent several hours on the phone with customer service which thinks we’re all idiots (or so it seems). They promise to send a brand new one since mine is under warranty and it’s not an issue I caused (it’s a well known hardware issue apparently). I now have two refurbished ones that are marked “refurbished” on the box before you even open it. This whole thing has been a joke. I can’t use the kindle, get lied to by customer service reps, and now I can’t take it on a trip that I would love to read on. No one should be satisfied with receiving a refurbished one (and I’ve read horror reviews of people who had to go through this same bricking crap with their used replacement models until they finally gave up). At this point, I just want my money back and never have to use Amazon again.",8 people found this helpful

I also have more than 5K books on it. I understand that SW gets upgraded. I worked in IT for many years. HOWEVER, a prime precept is that new SW be better than the old. The developers obviously don't read books. I hate the view of the covers but I'll ignore that one since you can switch to a list. What I REALLY HATE is the scroll bar. Previously you could 'go to' an author or title. Now you have to scroll up/down with a bar that is too small and too sensitive to be of any use. Why can't you go directly to what you want. Also the screen is so sensitive that if you accidentally touch it wrong it jumps to the end of the book. There is no way to get back to where you were reading without manually going through the chapters until you find your place. I don't know about you, but I don't remember what chapter I was in. Also, in many cases it takes multiple tries to 'remove download'.  This is just a few of my complaints about the interface. I have looked on other forums and there are many others who feel the same. Why didn't you do a 'usability' test prior to the release? If you will notice, I have purchased many fewer books since the SW release. It's just too much trouble.",7 people found this helpful

Not impressed so far.Dark mode flashes white with every page turn, making it unusable.Touch screen is not very responsive to touch when I'm trying to click a link yet seems super sensitive to page turns so I keep advancing multiple pages - and then it's hard to go backwards. It seems that only the far left strip will turn back a page (or swiping backwards), and touching the rest of the page advances. On the Fire I didn't have to be quite so precise.Couldn't figure out how to x out of a book. Had to Google it. (Touch the top half inch of screen, not swipe.)It's weird and annoying that there is something on the screen all the time, if it's off I want it black.Power button on bottom seems like a poor choice. Also power plug on bottom - I read laying down often, and have destroyed cords for my phone by resting the device on them while charging, so I expect that'll happen here too unless I never need to read while charging.Will give it a few more days to see if I get used to it, and decide whether to keep it, but it's maybe not great when your six year old reader is still a superior experience to your brand new one.",5 people found this helpful

Our Kindle Paperwhite Signature Edition stopped working less than a month after we received it. After spending way too much time troubleshooting, our Kindle has been stuck on this screen (photo attached) for days. No amount of hard resetting worked. We called Amazon to try and resolve and the agent literally told us ""I'm sorry, but all I can offer you is 15% off to purchase ANOTHER Kindle."" You're kidding me, right? They sold us a defective Kindle (one that cost over $200) and it stopped functioning after 3 weeks and NOW the Customer Care agent said our only resolution was to buy a new Kindle. Get out of town.We used to love Amazon's Customer Support. They were always responsive, understanding and quick to resolve any issues. But this is total BS. Don't buy this Kindle. Your money is best spent on an iPad mini instead.",2 people found this helpful

But the software is broken. There is no way to avoid having thumbnails for the books even in list mode. As a result the large page is wasted on displays that are useless for me. Also menu's across the top of the page also are gone in this edition so  some lose of functionality for me.The worst is the fact that I use borrowed for kindle unlimited books as a catagory/colection and the software continues to give incorrect counts and lists of books. Since this broken software has also updated itself to the old paperwhite and oasis the counts are wrong on these kindles also. As an example at the time I had 10 borrowed books the new  paperwhite showed 4, the old paperwhite showed 8 and the oasis showed 17.As a result unless the next call for help results in a software correction the order will be returned.I'ld give it 1 star as the kindle still looks clean although useless for reading.",One person found this helpful

About a month into owning it -- it died.  I waited several week to get a replacement as, I guess, a big demand for these over the holidays.  I received the replacement today and tried to charge it using the Charging stand and found out that that no longer worked either!Amazon will send out a replacement of that in about a month.  -- another wait for this ""signature"" equipment.  I have a feeling that they will want to take the name ""Signature"" off of this model and charging stand because it is sure ruining my love of my Kindle experience.Summary:  In my opinion, stay away from this charging stand -- it is completely superfluous and clutters up table tops.

So you can only have 21 books or newspaper issues on the device.Prior software versions allowed more on device storage.Pick these 21 things carefully because the only way to remove them is by adding a new one that bumps off the oldest. “Remove download” previously removed a book or issue from the device but now it only eliminates the text. The cover image remains.I read a daily newspaper on my kindle and could previously remove issues after reading them. Now my Home Screen  fills up with read back issues and all the books get bumped back to the cloud.After 21 days there are no books on my kindle.I can find them again in the cloud but it is a bother and they are then just queued up to be bumped off again.I got this paperwhite 11th gen because my 7th gen got this software update and became a pain…prior software allowed more books on the device…I could schedule future reads and they would be waiting…I could remove completed books or issues.

In the Paperwhite Signature Edition 11th Generation, You got rid of text to speech and claim that accessibility has something like that but the device needs Bluetooth speakers or air buds. Fine. Once you set those up, there is no control over the book choices. The book is so difficult to maneuver around that the frustration is completely overwhelming. Whoever designed this feature should be fired just for being stupid! If it isn’t broke then don’t fix it! The older versions were very user friendly and your new versions do not work. The format and display are also not easy to deal with.  Worst decision to buy this version and I was OVERLY generous when I gave this 1 star because it deserves a ZERO star!

This seems like a firmware design problem - after owning this less than 4 months, it just started an endless reboot cycle and never gets past the boot screen (with the kid under the tree).  ‘Hard-reset’ doesn’t do anything, and there has been no damage / drop to the device.  Looking online, this does appear to happen to this latest generation of devices.  Cross your fingers and hope it happens in the warranty period (90 days)!.  I had to emphasize to customer support that this had to be a software problem, or a design defect with the power button continually pressed in a bag.  As an engineer, if I had to guess, holding down the power button continuously can cause the device to hard boot in the middle of a reboot causing an un-bootable state.I’m normally a big fan of kindle devices, but this is really unacceptable.  I hope engineering gets ahead of this and fixes it in a future generation.(Update) After arguing with the Amazon customer service reps, they ultimately replaced the kindle.  I caught a similar behavior recently on the new device, but managed to avoid the brick.  I don’t have a case, and if you set the device down standing up, it will trigger and hold the power button, causing a repeated hard-boot, including hard-boots in the middle of hard-boots.  Bad design.  I’m leaving this as 1-star for awareness and encouragement for Amazon to fix the design defect (even just via software).",11 people found this helpful

The battery lasts a long time.. The wireless charging is really nice, especially since the power port is usually the first part of a Kindle to have problems.Cons:. This is my first Kindle with a screen that's easily scratched. They're light scratches, but they're permanent. All I did was put it in my purse.. It can't be held from the top of the screen. The border there is only about 1/2 inch and I'm constantly activating the menus. Constantly.. It's already gone dead for no reason, a problem I've only had on older Kindles after a couple years of use.  Rebooting fixes it but I shouldn't have to do that. I went to bed with it at 60% and woke up to the battery screen on.. The position of the power button means that sometimes when I put it on the wireless charger, it turns on.. A large number of books on it slows it down considerably. I bought the version with more memory, but processing hasn't improved since the older models.All in all, this is not worth spending extra money on.Update 5/25/22: They managed to make this Kindle even more unusable with their recent software update that changed the whole file system. No way to get rid of ads completely (even though I paid for it), no way to hide collections that aren't favorited, and no way to go back to the older version.

I had an old Paperwhite for years and an even older Kindle before that. I got this Signature Edition for Christmas (45 days ago) and it’s totally worth the upgrade. The screen is much better and the warm backlight is the best.Sadly, like other reviewers experienced, it bricked itself. I finished a book, bought the next book in the series right on the Kindle, and boom - stuck on the Kindle/Kid-under-the-tree screen. Tried rebooting, tried leaving it alone, tried plugging it in, tried wireless charger - nothing. I chatted customer service and after TWO questions (Did you try rebooting? Can you access the home screen?) was sent a replacement for free. We’ll see how long this one lasts and I’ll update this review if needed.Ultimately, I realize a handful of reviews may be inconsequential, but I hope Amazon can recall the devices or fix the issue with software. There are a lot of Kindle folk out there that will be real bummed by this. Kindles have always been my old reliable devices. Phones come and go, but my Kindles have lasted me eons.

I could not do continuous vertical smooth scrolling especially in the landscape mode.BTW, I'm happy that the stupid physical page turn buttons are absent on the Signature edition.UPDATE:For me at least it's easy to do horizontal thumb swipe (the stupid tap-turn disabled) for page turns.

Is Amazon so greedy and misinformed that after buying only kindle books since the first kindle was released they still try to sell me on titles I don’t buy? With this kindle , several new updates over the last year have made it nearly impossible to find the cover of the book I’m reading or just finished.  The image of the books I’ve read are so tiny it’s often impossible to read the title or author.  I want a real book type experience where I see the cover of the book I’m reading everytime I open my kindle. Instead Amazon uses it as an opportunity to sell more, sell more sell more. advertising books and authors I have no interest in. Hasn't Amazon made enough profit of off us? Isn’t enough I buy my books and kindle, groceries and gifts, household items and much more? Just let me read in peace without an add every evening when I open my book to relax. Absolutely nothing is worse than having to hunt for the book cover.  The familiar joke with my fellow kindle readers is we can’t easily recall author and title because we see it once during purchase. Tricky advertising diminishes my joy of reading on the kindle.",7 people found this helpful

Before this happened the device worked fine, then one day it was just stuck. Mind you my kindle rarely left the house--it lives on my nightstand because I only get to read right before bed. Amazon replaced it with a refurb and the refurb's warranty goes till the original device warranty. This is a scam. My theory is that Amazon made this edition more fragile so they have to be replaced more frequently because previous kindles do not die if you treat them well enough. To wit, my original paperwhite (bought 10/2012) still works fine---the 3g data even works. [I got this new one because I thought I lost my original one. Found my lost one two months into owning this one]Honestly if this thing dies in a few months I will just go back to my 10 year old Kindle, and may look at ditching the Kindle platform altogether and go back to real books. I did not sign up to be replacing these devices every couple of years. Such a waste. Books at least biodegrade.In the meantime, if you are looking for a new Kindle, do not get this edition. Get one a generation back that does not have the awake/asleep function in the cover. Those previous versions are more reliable than this one.",5 people found this helpful

I can't listen to any of my audiobooks unless I purchase bluetooth ear buds, which are expensive, and I can't use ear buds. I could go on and on. I HATE the thing.",2 people found this helpful
"Kindle Paperwhite Signature Edition (32 GB) – With a 6.8"" display, wireless charging, and auto-adjusting front light – Without Lockscreen Ads – Black",1.0,You can't search or order books with this product,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on August 20, 2022",Color: Black | Option: Without Kindle Unlimited,True,"I'm old fashioned and this was my first e-reader, My wife has used them for years so I decided to finally join the 20th century. The Kindle worked well for the first month or so, but now I find I can't use it to search for books or order books (which is why I rate ease of reading 1 star). Since the Kindle is Wi-Fi enabled and was able to do this stuff in the past, it appears somebody decided that was too convenient. The philosophy of this really annoys me - the device is clearly capable of doing these things so somebody had to actively go in and make it harder. Although I like the reader itself, I really can't reward what appears to be either blatant stupidity or some marketing scheme to make more money (although how escapes me). So, I won't order any more books and I won't use the Kindle anymore. Sure, that's a childish reaction but if enough people acted childishly, maybe somebody will restore the functionality that I bought and paid for. I feel cheated.Kent Lyons",2 people found this helpful

One feature I miss is the auto-rotating of the Oasis. The position of the page does not follow the rotating of the Paperwhite. The USB-C charger is a definite upgrade. The power button is on the bottom, just a little off-center. I don’t think it will be an issue while holding the Paperwhite to read.  I like it much better than the Oasis.

This is the most intrusive device I have ever used and it doesn’t even have a camera.  It is the most carelessly designed invention I have ever seen; it never works how it is supposed to operate.  It changes settings, returns library books, and registers screen presses whenever it feels like it.  Any other company would not have made a device that actively antagonizes readers; any thinking person could have designed something better. It is a horrible, frustrating experience that is quickly souring from any potential improvement over paper.  I really do hate it.",

"Kindle Paperwhite Signature Edition (32 GB) – With a 6.8"" display, wireless charging, and auto-adjusting front light – Without Lockscreen Ads – Black",2.0,Worst touch screen ever,"Reviewed in the United States on March 1, 2022",Color: Black | Option: Without Kindle Unlimited,False,"I thought this would be perfect. I had an old Kindle HD Kindle but the battery lasted only about 15 minutes. I only ever read on it so thought I would just get a Kindle Paperwhite. Worst decision ever! Yes, the battery is good and it is fine to actually read on but every time you turn the page the screen flashes. It takes so long for the menu to respond you think it did not register and touch it again but then it registers both touches and takes you some place you did not intend to go.  Normally when you search you can go into one book or series in the list, then you select the back button to go to go back to your search list, but with the Kindle Paperwhite, that is not how it works. You go back to the original list and have to do the search all over again. When you scroll it sometimes take you into a book instead of the next page, loosing your search yet again. It is the most frustrating device for our times. We are so advanced, why would they make a device that It is like trying to get online with a modem and that flickers like flipping channels on an old black and white TV? I now do all my research on my laptop or iPad to figure out exactly what I want and send to the kindle and hope it comes through. This way I have to go through a few clicks to get to the book, but you should be able to do more. The only plus is the size and weight. That is the only reason to use it.  Otherwise stick to your other devices. I would return it if I could but I waited to long and it was a gift. Maybe I got a dud and should have tried to return it but assuming this functionality is normal I do not recommend for anyone who expects a responsive device or has trouble with flashing every time you turn a page.",2 people found this helpful

"Kindle Paperwhite Signature Edition (32 GB) – With a 6.8"" display, wireless charging, and auto-adjusting front light – Without Lockscreen Ads – Black",5.0,My Reading Headaches Are Gone! *literally*,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on January 15, 2022",Color: Black | Option: Without Kindle Unlimited,True,"I hesitated to buy a Kindle for a very long time to my ruin.At first, I didn't understand why I would need an e-reader. After all, I have a phone and tablet that have great ebook apps. Wouldn't having a device dedicated to electronic books be a redundant waste?Then, I realized that all my attempts to read on my devices resulted in my eyes straining, my head aching, and my mind unable to focus. I bought paper books whenever I could, but a lot of my research materials for work could only be found in digital format. I had no choice but to read ebooks, so I needed to find another solution.And that solution was to buy a Kindle.PROS- The e-ink technology of the screen makes a dramatic difference in my reading experience.I can read for hours without the strain and headaches that a traditional screen would cause. I'm kind of addicted to reading on my Kindle now.- I love being able to discover new books and instantly download them. No more waiting for paper books to be delivered.- Highlighting is so easy.- The battery life is amazing.- The Paperwhite is super lightweight, compact, and easy to hold. I have a connective tissue disorder and holding books can sometimes aggravate my joint and nerve pain tremendously.In fact, I stopped reading a giant, 900-page book several months ago because my hands just couldn't take holding it anymore. I downloaded it as an ebook on this device and might be able to finish it now!CONS- E-ink screens flash black every so many pages or when you tap on to any new screen/menu. At first, I thought my device was broken. But, no, what looks like a full-screen glitch is important to its functioning.Initially, it bothered me, but then I eventually got used to it.  Now I barely notice at all.- The touchscreen has a very slow response. It makes me feel like I'm using technology from 10 years ago, instead of a brand new 2021 release. I like the taking notes feature, but the touch response is so slow that it picks up only half the letters I type.- If you send PDFs or other documents to your Kindle, it can take a long time for them to show up.- It can't run apps. Also, it has a web browser feature that is the slowest thing on the planet. Again, it makes me feel like I'm using dial-up instead of high-speed wifi.OVERALLThis e-reader has saved me from headaches and nerve pain. It is a pleasure to read on. Also, it's very cute.However, its touch screen technology and processing speed will make you feel like you time-traveled to the past.For me, it fulfills a serious need I had and the pros outweigh the cons. Of course, everyone's situation is different.",15 people found this helpful

So naturally I wanted the best one so I didn’t have to buy another for a very long time. Well I absolutely love this new kindle it’s lite and the screen is very clear even if you turn the brightness all the way down. It looks very natural to a piece of paper especially with the backlight you cant even tell that its a light it’s so natural if that makes sense. Anyways I’ve had it for about two weeks and have read a couple books (I’m a slow reader) I really enjoy every feature and I’m still at 67% on my first charge. It goes down about 1% a day which isn’t bad at all especially at half brightness. The wireless charger worked well but you only need to charge it once and awhile but it is a nice feature. 32GB will last you years and years  maybe more lol  The warm light is nice but I haven’t used it much. The auto brightness I turned off but it is a nice feature if your going to be taking it on the go.  Buy one of these paperwhites you won’t regret it. Worth the wait. I absolutely love it! I waited a whole month for this it was the longest I’ve ever waited but I’m glad I stuck it out. It went on sale after I bought it so it’s a great deal if you can catch it on sale. I watched a ton of YouTube videos and thought long and hard about getting it. But honestly I am not a huge reader and I was hesitant about spending the money but I’m so glad I did. If you can’t buy this one or don’t want to spend the extra the 8gb is just as great. Don’t hesitate like me buy it now it’s worth it! Tons of extra features like highlighting and dictionary and all sorts of fun stuff to discover. Hope this helps.,3 people found this helpful

Not that they are horrible, their devices serve their purpose. But it’s become evident to me that they are many years behind amazons products.

Even the optional sleep/wake case is superior to nooks brand case in every way.  I love this ereader so much I’m taking it with me literally everywhere. Nook claims their ereaders last weeks, but I can read for 1 hour and lose 10% battery on my new glow 4.On this here kindle I can read an hour (with backlight on and connected to wifi and lose like 2% battery.Now this one I can see lasting for weeks unlike my nook Glowlights 3 & 4 despite them both claiming the same.I recommend this product to everyone who loves to read. Although I will say most will be perfectly fine with the base model paperwhite  for 140. This signature edition is for the hardcore ones and anyone interested in listening to audiobooks from their kindle because those audio books take up a substantially larger amount of memory than ebooks do. (8gb is adequate for most people for just ebooks)The wireless charging on the signature edition is a nice touch, but it’s hardly necessary with a battery life that requires very infrequent charges to begin with. The base model is perfectly fine if you do not care for these extra features. It has everything else you’ll ever need for less money. I however just had to go with the top tier model. When it comes to either books or gamin, I spoil myself. Haha. If you’ve read this far you’re already interested in getting a kindle. Just go for it.

I do wish the screen was about an inch larger personally, but this definitely works! Also it is able to display the table of contents in PDFs as well as allowing you to select and search for word definitions, again two features that make this a very useful companion to large textbooks on the go. For some reason Amazon still blocks you from downloading many non-pdf kindle store purchased textbooks onto the device. That is a bit perplexing since they probably actually work on this device. Maybe a suggestion for future improvement would be to allow textbook download onto kindles that have a minimal screen resolution and/or screen size, this particular device being allowed.

When I saw they released a new generation of the Paperwhite, I thought ""Sure, I need one of those"". The truth of the matter was I really didn't NEED it, but I'm sure glad I purchased it.I'm a fan of the Paperwhite and I've owned the two previous generations. I read almost exclusively on it. When I ordered this one, it wasn't due to ship for about six weeks, but there was no urgency. To my surprise, it shipped a lot sooner (about three weeks), and it was worth the wait.I kept my previous generation Paperwhite, so it's interesting to compare the two. This new one is slightly bigger which is nice. It's still really easy to transport in a large pocket. It also has an auto sensing back-light which works really well in all light conditions. The other thing I like is the ability to adjust the warmness of the screen. If you're adverse to the really ""white"" back-light, you can adjust it to a much warmer tone. It's also worth mentioning that the battery life is excellent. I've been reading it daily for almost two months and have yet to charge it.Bottom line is if you're in the market for a Paperwhite, just buy this one. If you already own one. I still think you'll be impressed with the new features. Amazon offers a trade-in program for your old one if you want to save a few bucks. I hung on to mine for a spare.

I have used it everyday for the last few weeks for 30-60 minutes a day and still have about 80% battery while reading in a dimly lit room. If you can afford the upgrade it is worth it. I found it will wirelessly charge on the same stand I have for my iPhone so if you have one of those already you may not need to buy the optional charging dock.",One person found this helpful
"Kindle Paperwhite Signature Edition (32 GB) – With a 6.8"" display, wireless charging, and auto-adjusting front light – Without Lockscreen Ads – Black",5.0,Excited to get new Kindle,"Reviewed in the United States on January 22, 2022",Color: Black | Option: Without Kindle Unlimited,True,"My ancient Kindle has died. I was really upset but on the other hand it was 10+ years old. The only other thing I’ve bought was my van and it’s 32 years old.I spend a lot of time reading and I am anticipating years of use with my new Paperwhite. I had quite a library of books I kept as reference on the old Kindle. They were all easily transferred to the new one with room to spare. It was suggested I use the IOS program on my cell phone to make the app do all the work. Wow!! Was that easy. Then I updated the software using the new Kindle. That was easy too!! Having a touch screen is fabulous too. The old Kindle version had a keyboard. If I wasn’t careful about eating/not eating while using it the keyboard could get sticky. In fact that was what I thought was wrong with the old Kindle at first and cleaned the screen and keyboard (using a needle to scrape/dislodge gunk around the keys). Alas, something else was going whack with the old Kindle. I mourned a couple of days thinking all my books were lost and then investigated to see what Kindles were available and their cost. I was delighted to see I could make monthly payments on the new one. I think I should have gotten the case to protect it too. I’ll order it later.",
"Kindle Paperwhite Signature Edition (32 GB) – With a 6.8"" display, wireless charging, and auto-adjusting front light – Without Lockscreen Ads – Black",4.0,Clear update on Kindle Paperwhite,"Reviewed in the United States on January 4, 2022",Color: Black | Option: Without Kindle Unlimited,True,"I've used previous versions of the Kindle and the Kindle Paperwhite.  This newest version is the best one yet.  The improvements to clarity and speed of the pages are impressive.  It's the perfect reading tool, especially for bedtime reading.  I was hesitant to upgrade from the 2019 version since that one does everything I need, but when my daughter gave me the newest version for Christmas, I was upgraded and am very happy.  So why give it four stars?  Unlike earlier Paperwhite models, there is no option to get cellular service for the Paperwhite - so it depends on wifi only for connection.  I wouldn't mind paying a few $$ extra but it's just not an option for the newest Paperwhite. If you need to download a new read while stuck at a location without wifi, you are out of luck.  This is especially a problem when traveling.  I still have my earlier version with cell so I'll take that with me.",

(My paperwhite is almost 8 years old now and the battery isn't staying charged like it used to, so it now only lasts about 30 min before giving me the battery dead symbol on screen.  I normally only use it on long rides or airplane flights, so battery life is somewhat critical.) In parentheses only because it is about an older product and not the current, but may give insight to how long you can expect the newer product to last if made with the same quality and design.  Again, this product is just an eReader and is not a color display, nor a regular tablet so don't expect more than a device to read books.",

I’ve had a Fire tablet for a while now and it was just too large and too bright to comfortably read anything but graphic novels for me. At least for long periods of time.This thing feels magical. The e ink display makes you feel like your holding a magic book that rewrites it’s only page every time you’re ready to move on to the next one. It’s extremely light even with the leather case. It’s comfortable in every way and the warm light feature is great. I’ve already finished two books on it after having it a few days and I’m in love.This is however an extremely niche product, If you’re a big reader and want something that looks and feels like paper this is for you. It does one thing and it does it flawlessly. If you want a tablet get a tablet. This is not a tablet this is definitely an E reader and nothing else (despite offering some other basic features). For me that’s exactly what I wanted and it’s perfect!If you want an e reader and you’re on the fence, just get it. Once it’s in your hands you’ll understand exactly what I mean.",

Trading that device in for this one has been a major game changer for me. I can read for long periods of time comfortably, I find that this device seems to “disappear” more as I become absorbed in the reading experience which was the goal all along.

It came with 3 months free of kindle unlimited and I love the selection they had of books I will likely pay monthly for the subscription.

I use it all the time. With my eyes deteriorating with age, this has become my favorite way to read.The battery life is very good. I can get through a few books without needing a recharge.

I have a lot of books, and I'm slowly downloading everything in case of an Internet outage.The screen is excellent. The size of the device is excellent. The only complaint about the physical device is that the button on the bottom is a little too easy to accidentally press, which puts the device into sleep mode. I do this from time to time, and must wait a few seconds while it wakes up again. It's bad design, but not a killer for me.I love that it can be charged wirelessly. I almost never use the stand to do this, but that's a personal quirk. I do use the stand to hold the device while I read, and it works well both with the flip cover open and when the cover is tucked behind the device.I had been using a phone and sometimes a tablet to read before purchasing this device. It was fine, and I had had some doubts as to whether I needed yet another doodad, but I'm very glad I got this.",4 people found this helpful

So far pretty happy with it. About time they added USB-C. The adaptive lighting is really nice.Have not had a chance to push the new battery life to it's limit yet, but the older ones which were not rated as long were good enough to let me read for the long flights between North America and India without having to recharge.I've been a Kindle user for many years and don't understand the heated complaints of some users about the on/off button position. Same position as usual, which I have never accidentally hit ever.I knew when buying it that they have dropped cellular, which is the only disappointment with the basic design. I travel a lot and can't always count on a WiFi connection if I get a spontaneous desire for a new book.I originally pre-ordered from Amazon weeks before the launch date, but was given a delivery date 6 weeks after launch which was right as I was leaving on a long trip.

To my dismay, the very next year I discovered that they'd released this incredible piece of technology. At nearly $200, I felt I should wait until a sales event, so I bought it as a birthday present to myself on Prime Day 2022 for around $139. This is easily the best purchase that I have made within the last 12 months, and top 5 within the past several years. Not only does the warm light option greatly soothe my eyes, but the size is more substantial than you would assume. It's as similar to reading a physical book as I think e-readers will get anytime soon. Before my Kindle Paperwhite Signature was delivered, I read about 5 books from January-July. In the 2 months since it arrived, I've completed 13 books. It's worth noting that I've always been a physical book person for all the usual reasons (book smell, feel, aesthetic, etc.) And this device has converted me. The portability is incredible, the 32 GB storage capacity is breathtaking (although I don't imagine ever coming close to it seeing as I don't listen to audiobooks or other large files), and the screen resolution in comparison to the 2018 kindle is definitely noticable. I cannot tell you how elated I am to Finally be allowed to put micro-USB behind me in favor of all USB-C charging devices. I'm in love with this piece of technology and would easily count it as my most valued inanimate possession.",2 people found this helpful

The battery last way longer. I don't know if it's a larger battery or if they have figured out how to use less juice but no doubt about it I would say that it lasts 2-3 times as long as the old Kindle. I've found that leaving the Wi-Fi on doesn't even use that much battery.3. so convenient that they finally went over to USB C its the defacto standard for non apple world. 4. Weight is only an ounce heavier and I found that it still will fit into my sling bag and my coat pocket a little bit bigger but not so big as to make it unwieldy5. I think that the new screen is slightly brighter than the old Kindle6. It's been out long enough that I was able to get a tempered glass screen protector and an origami case so all the accessories are available for itNow we get into the negative 1.  it is obvious that Amazon is changing the kindle in small increments right now the technology exists quite easily for them to allow you to whisper sync with audible IE read a book at the same time that you're listening to audible. That they are saving this for the next generation or maybe another generation ticks me off aside from that this unit has everything I need.2. I wish they could get the page turns more reliable. Every 7 or 8 pages it doesn't register the press/swipe.It's bright enough it's waterproof not too unwieldy and the extra space on the screen really makes a difference add more battery life.I'm very glad I upgraded,One person found this helpful

No more running your finger across the screen to get to your page. My only gripe is the backlight is not as bright as the others.

Also, it is very hard to adjust the lighting on this Kindle. My old kindles had a setting on the toolbar. This one does not and I have yet to be able to get the lighting the shade I like.

"Kindle Paperwhite Signature Edition (32 GB) – With a 6.8"" display, wireless charging, and auto-adjusting front light – Without Lockscreen Ads – Black",5.0,A well designed device,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on August 6, 2022",Color: Black | Option: Without Kindle Unlimited,True,"This unit was a replacement for my old Keyboard Kindle that I have had for the last 10 years. I still have it and will keep it although the battery only holds a charge for 24 hours.Touch ScreenThis took some time to get used to but I like it.  I did not like having to touch it with my finger and leave smudges on the screen.  I found it works well with an electro-conductive stylus, eliminating the need to touch the screen with my finger.  Even though I like the touch screen, I preferred the buttons on the Keyboard unit. I considered getting an Oasis but there were a lot of negative comments on battery life so I passed on it.  The one thing I do not like with the touch screen is that it is very easy to touch the screen in normal use and wind up a page of two away from where you want to be.Battery lifeSo far, I am happy with it.  I want to see how long the battery lasts if I keep the WiFi turned off unless I need it.  Battery life was the primary reason I bought the Paperwhite, in that all the reviews were good regarding the battery.  I had to use Airplane Mode to shut the WiFi off where as the Keyboard unit had a WiFi off/ on option on the home screen.ReadabilityI like the Paperwhite's sharp text and white background.  I also like the screen backlight.  Many times I will read at my workstation where the ambient light is low for image editing.  The backlit screen on the Kindle is perfect here.OverallI find that I rather like it after the initial period of ""Where did they put that""? I like the wireless charging as well. I hope it lasts as long as my first Kindle.",3 people found this helpful

Incredible battery life. I am some issues with navigation and believe that those are primarily a function of my unfamiliarity with my kindle. They will get better.

I can now only read them on their restrictive, trashy over controlled PC AP.Remember, you only RENT this product.  Amazon owns it.  You have no choice in how they change options.I used the category option to more easily find the books.  The usefulness of that  option is gone.  It was so helpful since I have thousands of books.See the old model category display.  How you can easily read titles, etc?  And sort?Well they ""fixed"" that.Look at the New version of category display and its very limited options.Do you see an option for only a text list versus little pictures that contain poor details?  I don't.What episode is the book you are reading?  I can't tell from the picture only, but the old LIST option told me.Also notice that the older version was paginated and you could see where you were on the list.  Not now!!  Now you get to scroll through multiple pages having no idea where you are in the list.I used the category option to more easily find the books.  The usefulness of that  option is gone.  Unless you can decipher a small picture that has very limited information that you normally cannot read.Plus the old option gave me only the collection I stored on my individual Kindle.NOW it lists all in the cloud so it is much more cluttered.  This is essentially true since my wife has separate categories created.Why did they eliminate excellent options to be replaced with cartoon options?In questions, people keep telling me the options are still there.  Do you see those options in the photos of the New Kindle?  I sure cannot find them.When I called to asked about this, I had to computer ""chat."" They told me I had to get on my computer to see what was on my Kindle.  They insisted.  Since I often use my kindle in remote places without internet, how am I to do that!?I should not have to be on my phone or computer to use my Kindle.This is crazy!Now the LIST option is only available to display thousands of books regardless of category.  That sucks.This is an electronic BOOK reader, not a tablet, not a laptop.  It is (was) excellent for the intended purpose.  Evidently that purpose was lost by current management and or programmers.Please educate your people about actually READING books and not trying to display comic books in black and white.",6 people found this helpful

Happy now and even though the memory is more than I need for my needs, I am enjoying the reading experience like the earlier models, but now with some great new features.  Happy reader.

Before this I had kindle fires for YEARS, but my eyes were hurting and I was getting headaches. Since I started exclusively reading my paperwhite I no longer get headaches. The battery lasts me a good three weeks about and I read daily for several hours. Some reviews said the bottom button (to turn it on and off) would randomly shut their kindles off while reading- that hasn’t been an issue for me AT ALL. I have a case on mine so the button isn’t as exposed but even before I had a case it wasn’t an issue for me. I love the light adjustments and warm affect on this kindle. I also like that its easy to use and set up. It took me less than five minutes to set it up. Overall I don’t really have anything I dislike except that when reading on the kindle app I can automatically post a full review to Amazon and goodreads but on the paperwhite I can only post my Star rating automatically.

It has a 6.8"" screen and has wireless charging capability plus USB C port. And it also has the new warm light for reading at night. And in the words of my wife, it is AWESOME. She reads a lot at night and finds the warm reading light fantastic. She can also adjust her font a little larger because it has increased in size. You wouldn't think .8 inch would be a big deal, but it is. It still has the 32gb memory, so she can store a ton of books on it.So to keep this short, I would recommend getting this years upgrade.

You can either have it set in a black mold with a yellow tint or white mold with a yellow tint. You also have the option Of leaving the screen with a blue tent.-It’s definitely bigger so words fits more on the screen then the other smaller kindles.-With the 32 I don’t have to worry about any space. I bought the 8 and kept on freezing. I don’t know if it was because it was sent in a package without any patting. I was able to get the 32 at a discounted price from an actual Amazon store and I didn’t have to worry about it getting dropped during shipment.Cons:- It is a bit heavier then the regular Kindle generation 10.- You do need a case for it. I will most likely get a screen protector. I just feel like it might break more easily than my old Kindle. ( so far I have dropped it twice and nothing has scratched)Overall I highly recommend getting a bigger storage capacity than the 8 because I like to save a lot of books. So far I am very happy!,

I love the Kindle Paperwhite BUT I cannot find a solution to the fact that this Kindle does not connect, through Bluetooth, to wireless earbuds. I’d love to periodically listen to audio books. Amazon is anxious to sell you an Audio subscription without the capability of using wireless headphones. There is not a plug for wired headphones or I’d resort to that. My Raycon earbuds work on every other device I own, and they’re less than a year old, so I know it’s not the ear buds. I tried turning both all the way off. I tried connecting 10 times in a row. I tried a factory reset. The software is up to date. I’m out of ideas. May have to return my Paper white and just read on my Fire 8 where the headphones work. Disappointing. I would NOT purchase until they resolve this issue. Unless you’ll never use audio books.",
"Kindle Paperwhite Signature Edition (32 GB) – With a 6.8"" display, wireless charging, and auto-adjusting front light – Without Lockscreen Ads – Black",5.0,"I compare my experience with the Kindle Paperwhite, Oasis and Special Edition","Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on August 11, 2022",Color: Black | Option: Without Kindle Unlimited,True,"I've owned three different Kindles and here's my comparison and what I liked about them:I got the Kindle Paperwhite back in 2018 because I was sick of notifications popping up on my phone and iPad interrupting me while trying to read. I loved that I could focus on reading, read in the dark without bothering my boyfriend and that the battery life was so amazing!I upgraded to the Kindle Oasis in 2020 and loved the elevated experience, but I noticed the battery didn't last nearly as long as my Kindle Paperwhite. Which is incredibly disappointing when the Kindle Oasis is so expensive. To be honest the whole reason I bought the Special Edition version is because I read the battery life was so good and has ample amount of storage in it, probably more than I could ever need in this lifetime.The other thing I noticed about the Special Edition version, that I did not hear a single review mention on YouTube or TikTok,  is how super responsive the screen is! I swear, to me it  seems to respond faster than either of the previous models I have owned before. A super nice surprise. I personally love having the long battery life because I mostly read laying down and the last thing I want is to have to charge it while I'm reading, just too restrictive for me. I would get the Special Edition version if you really love downloading and keeping a ton of books to read for leisure and/or read a lot of books or PDFs for school. I think 32 gb would go along way if I were using this as a student exclusively in place of physical books.Overall, if I had to pick from the three versions of Kindle I have owned, I would go with the Oasis version. If like me, you really hate having to move your hand to tap the screen to go to the next or previous page. Want a more premiere reading experience don't really care that you have to charge more often, this is checks all the boxes.",11 people found this helpful

"Kindle Paperwhite Signature Edition (32 GB) – With a 6.8"" display, wireless charging, and auto-adjusting front light – Without Lockscreen Ads – Black",5.0,"Very easy on eyes compared to phone, tablet","Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on December 21, 2022",Color: Black | Option: Without Kindle Unlimited,True,"I purchased this 2021 model e-reader to replace my 2018 model that was getting glitchy. I have other electronic devices to read on but I don't get nearly the eye fatigue with the e-reader. This newer version has a warmth setting which improves the comfort factor over the older model.  It's more like reading a physical book, but with the advantages of adjustments for different lighting conditions and desired font size, among other helpful settings. So, A+ for that.The touchscreen still has shortcomings. Overall it seems like prehistoric software. When I tap to turn the page, I frequently turn 2 pages instead of one. I don't have that problem using kindle app on other devices. On the e-reader,  I have to hit letters just right when typing in information or the letter doesn't type. Overall, response to touch input is laggy. Scrolling is better than on 2018 model but still scrolling in any direction is slow and awkward. All of these problems are somewhat alleviated by using the kindle app on phone or tablet for all functions except downloading book to the e reader and reading the book. I select, purchase, browse, and organize books using kindle app on my phone. Then I download the book I'm going to read to the e-reader and read it. When I'm finished, I go back to kindle app on my phone to remove book from Home or return it Kindle Unlimited. Then I select the next book I want to read and download it to my phone. Finally, I download the book to the e-reader and read it. Downloading the book to the phone first makes downloading to e-reader more straightforward.The slightly larger size of the 2021 version does enhance reading without any drawbacks that I've noticed. I can read more before needing to turn page and that seems to facilitate a faster reading rate.Depending on the book, you don't see the page number on the pages. There are steps to determine the page number but not nearly as convenient as actually seeing the page number on the page. The same goes for percentage of book finished and the total number of pages in the book. I am reading a book now that doesn't show page # or % of book read on the pages of the book.",2 people found this helpful

I Have a ton of both kinds of books and room to spare.  If you know you will not need the storage, I would advise looking at the Kid's version.The Kid's version of either the paperwhite or the kindle 2022 is the way to go.You get a 2-year ""hassle-free"" guarantee for just a bit more money.  It also comes with a protective pad that is ugly but will work until you get your own.  It even comes with access to a ton of kids' books that you may never need.

What an improvement over the old Paperwhite!  Over the years I've had everything from the base Kindle, Kindle Paperwhite, and Kindle Oasis.

Much bigger screen, in the same size Kindle.  Overall, the responsiveness is vastly improved over even the Oasis that I replaced.  A lightly textured back helps make holding the Signature Edition easy and less fatiguing than the smooth backing of other devices.Wireless charging on the signature edition makes it simple to ensure that the battery sipping Kindle (read: long lasting battery!) is always topped off and ready for a month long road trip with no charger!",

"Kindle Paperwhite Signature Edition (32 GB) – With a 6.8"" display, wireless charging, and auto-adjusting front light – Without Lockscreen Ads – Black",5.0,"New 32 gig Paperwhite, 11th generation","Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on March 23, 2022",Color: Black | Option: Without Kindle Unlimited,True,"I bought this 32 gig version of the Paperwhite to replace my 4 year old 4 gig version. The micro USB charging opening on my old one is loose, so it's very hard to charge it. Only one or two of my many cords will even work, and I have to be careful not to bump it, or the charging stops. The new one charges with a C, which is far superior to the old micro USB type charging cord. I bought the 32 gig version this time because I have a few thousand ebooks, and I like having the ones I want to read already downloaded and ready to go. It will hold a lot more ebooks than the old 4 gig. This new reading screen area is wider and taller in the new Paperwhite compared to the old one. I also like that there's a wider variety of reading screen shades/darkness available to use on the new one. There's a warmth schedule that you can set either automatically or manually for a certain time span.  You can customize the amount of warmth, too. There's also a ""nightlight"" that will decrease brightness over time as your eyes adjust to darkness, and of course there is an adjustment you can use to increase the regular brightness of the screen. I have set my new Paperwhite so that the screensaver is the cover of the book I am currently reading, which is a nice feature instead of an advertisement. The page turn feature is accessed through the font option in the book you're reading, and can be set for page turn animation or just a page change when you tap or brush the right or left of the screen, and mine is working just fine, with a quick page change. I bought a Fintie cover for my new Paperwhite, and it has a magnetic feature so that the cover remains open until I close it. There's a stand I can set up to read hands free, and when the cover is closed, the Paperwhite goes to sleep. This cover is lower than the ereader's bottom switch, so there is no chance I will accidentally trigger the bottom switch on the ereader. I also haven't had any of the glitches on the new Paperwhite that have been reported by other reviewers, my new ereader has worked wonderfully. So far, this Paperwhite has been much more of a quality ereader compared to my old one, and I'm a satisfied customer.",One person found this helpful

I don’t know who designed the technology but they certainly did not make it user friendly. I was recently on a cruise vacation in Europe and had downloaded a variety of books for my trip. However, although I download them I never open them until I’m ready to read each book. I was on a 9 hour flight and finished one book and went to open a new one-it wouldn’t open even though I was able to access the planes WiFi. So there I was without a book for the remainder of the flight. We stayed in Europe at a hotel for 2 days and again the same problem. Once we were on the ship and logged into there WiFi I thought there would be no problem, wrong again, I could not open any of the books I downloaded. I went to the ships WiFi specialists and they did everything possible for 30 minutes (2) technicians, no luck. So there I was 10 day trip, $100.+Worth of books and could not open even one. When I got home I was able to open them allIn addition there is something built in that turns the screen grey every time it gets dark.

Came in Kindle pkging, with little manuals, etc. All looked pristine. Works great. I love the fact it has NO ADS, 32GB, dark and light versions, warmth adjustments. It's taking me a little while to get used to the controls. At first the 'photo' look when shut off was weird until it was explained to me that it's liquid ink... it's not stuck on. It's a bit picky on swiping up and down. I'll have to read up more on how the controls actually work. It's not quite as quick as my phone Kindle app. It's not bad, though. The 'touch' to go page forward or reverse is really touchy. Just by holding it, I can accidentally move pages forward and backward over and over... then have to find my place again. I'm learning to hold it by the straps on the back of the case now. No WONDER they put those straps on the cases! lol. The type is adjustable, clear and readable. I like that it doesn't make any noise. I can read in bed while my husband sleeps (without bothering him). Another feature I really like is that I can tap the top of the screen which calls up a window - where you can see what time it is. If you are reading in short bursts, in between other things - that is crucial. Comes with option to trial Kindle Unlimited. Also comes with a Goodreads account-not sure why I need that, but why not?

"Kindle Paperwhite Signature Edition (32 GB) – With a 6.8"" display, wireless charging, and auto-adjusting front light – Without Lockscreen Ads – Black",5.0,Fantastic!,"Reviewed in the United States on September 9, 2022",Color: Black | Option: Without Kindle Unlimited,True,"I had been debating getting an e-reader for a long time. I've always been a fan of books, but just never had the motivation to read (much less have room for) them. This device changed that in a day. Wow, am I glad I bought this.First, let me start by saying that this tablet is an e-reader, nothing more. If you're looking for color screens, apps, fancy looks, and audio, get a Kindle Fire 10 tablet. This device is only designed to read books (with Bluetooth audio devices, if needed). If you must have audio, a trick I used was to access Audible on your regular tablet or computer, listen to the audio of your book through regular speakers and just read along. This worked great since I had trouble locating my JLab headphones.Next, the touch screen. It is very sensitive (and yes, I agree with everyone complaining about the power button. Just watch where you hold it!). However, it's a minor complaint. The e-ink is amazing. In the right lighting conditions, it resembles an actual page from a book. I had to do a double take to make sure I was still holding a tablet in my hands. The battery life is stellar, I've only gone through only 15% of the battery in 3 days of reading 2-3 hours at a time.  The backlighting can be automatically adjusted to time of day and room conditions, which is a big help when you want to read before going to bed. The warm amber color is very much appreciated.Finally, storage space. If you're a heavy Audible or ChristianAudio user, the 8GB will fill up quickly. I got the 32GB just in case since I prefer reading and listening at the same time.I am super glad I made the jump to an e-reader and am currently reading ""Your Brain's Not Broken"" by Tamara Rosier. Now I can sell some of my surplus books for a little extra cash to people who need them and open up some space in my apartment. Thank you, Amazon! You've really struck gold with this Paperwhite Kindle! Final note, college students, you can get this at a 30% discount with the promo code 30KINDLE. I used it and it saved me a ton of money on this.",

I have maybe a five or six year old PaperWhite that worked OK still.  I wasn't sure if I needed the new 2021 model.  WOW, GREAT.  I tried a Signature out in an Amazon Store and bought it in 30 seconds.Very sharp, sensitive screen and pages turn instantly.  For me, the orange hue is a perk.  I read it's incrementally heavier but i didn't notice that at all.  I often highlight and sometimes take notes, and while typing on a Kindle is never ""good"" the faster speed and more sensitive screen of the 2021 models is an improvement.  Also, the now the ""tap to turn"" always works even with a tiny tap.I enjoy reading at night in a jacuzzi and while I've never gotten a Kindle wet, the water resistance is a perk.I'm not sure if i needed the extra Signature memory, but I absorb quite a few books in a hybrid way between text and Audible.  Audio books can approach 300-400 MB so unless you're careful to keep one or two at a time  they would use up 8 gb before too long.",

Even dimming the Brightness it is hard to read on white screens.The battery life is amazing.  I can leave it for a week or two, depending how much I read.  I don't use the wireless charger, since when I think of charging it I'm using it so just plug it in, USB 2.0.I also chose the unit that didn't have the ads on the close screen so I have a choice between the pictures they have or the cover of the current novel I'm reading.I bought the package that came with a cover and the wireless charger.  The cover is very nice, fits in the charger. Allows the device to turn on when you open it.  The device will auto shut off even when the case is opened.I'm very happy with this purchase, maybe I'll eventually use the wireless charger;apparently you can charge the Galaxy phones on it. I haven't tried this yet.",4 people found this helpful

It's easy to read in sunlight & indoors. It has become a necessity.  I rely on this & so much better than storing physical books in my house! This is 3rd Kindle paperwhite. If you are a book lover, you should try o e. It's not an easy transition,  but after you get used to it, it's pretty great.
