"SAMSUNG Galaxy Tab A7 Lite 8.7"" 32GB WiFi Android Tablet w/ Long Lasting Battery, Compact, Slim Design, Sturdy Metal Frame, US VersonGray",5.0,Great Tablet for kids,"Reviewed in the United States on April 6, 2023",Style: WiFi Tablet | Color: Gray,True,"I purchase 2 for both of my boys. My youngest tablet worked great for about a month. Then out of nowhere, it wouldn't turn on. It was charged and even tried to factory reset it. It never turned back on. You would think I would give it 1 star because of this .. NOPE.I was out of policy and reached out to Amazon who then reach out to the seller. Because I was still under their policy.Within 10 mins, I was refunded and was able to order a new one and send the old one back. Customer service was AMAZING !!!!! I did purchase a warranty to make sure they are covered.",
"SAMSUNG Galaxy Tab A7 Lite 8.7"" 32GB WiFi Android Tablet w/ Long Lasting Battery, Compact, Slim Design, Sturdy Metal Frame, US VersonGray",5.0,Great product and easy to use.,"Reviewed in the United States on April 1, 2023",Style: WiFi Tablet | Color: Gray,True,"Works just like the larger Samsung tablets which I also have purchased. I bought this one for my grandson who is four years old. I bought it about 14 months ago and it has been dropped, thrown and handled roughly and it still works perfectly and looks great. It charges fast and is long lasting. Be sure to purchase a protective case. The soft cases with handles works best for kids. I prefer the hard cases but be sure to get one that allows easy access to the volume controls Some of the hard cases completely seal over the volume controls making them hard to operate and can damage them. these tablets also have touch screen volume control. This tablet is also very fast.",4 people found this helpful
"SAMSUNG Galaxy Tab A7 Lite 8.7"" 32GB WiFi Android Tablet w/ Long Lasting Battery, Compact, Slim Design, Sturdy Metal Frame, US VersonGray",5.0,Nice Tablet at a Great Price,"Reviewed in the United States on March 23, 2023",Style: WiFi Tablet | Color: Gray,True,"This tablet is not slow, regardless of what some of the reviews say. Of course I don't use it for gaming. I use it for everyday things like browsing, texting, checking Mint Money, email, Netflix, etc. It is not *quite* as zippy as my iPad, but it also didn't cost $600. I was concerned about it slowing down when the Android update came around, but it just updated to Android 13 this morning and it's still plenty fast! I did disable as much of the Samsung bloatware as it would let me and uninstalled or hid the other apps I never use. I'm quite pleased with it. I had an old Tab A that was very slow when browsing and it was capped at Android 9. This one blows that Tab A out of the water and even has a larger, brighter screen. I may use this instead of replacing my iPad (which is having issues). I like the 8.7"" screen. The iPad always seemed a bit big, but I wasn't ready to shell out $500 for a mini.Update 4/12/23: For those finding things to be a bit slow, make sure you turn OFF the RAM Plus ""feature"". It slows everything down. Go to settings->battery and device care->memory->RAM Plus-OFF. It really makes a lot of difference!",29 people found this helpful
"SAMSUNG Galaxy Tab A7 Lite 8.7"" 32GB WiFi Android Tablet w/ Long Lasting Battery, Compact, Slim Design, Sturdy Metal Frame, US VersonGray",5.0,Great Purchase,"Reviewed in the United States on March 23, 2023",Style: WiFi Tablet | Color: Gray,True,"Why Buy On Amazon+ I bought this tablet because my outdated iPad mini two finally gave out on me. Anywhere I tried to purchase the device in-person over charged and required me to purchase another phone/internet line on their carrier or mine. Getting one here on Amazon, where I don't need to pay for all the extras over the course of 2-3 years and where I can enjoy it for my simple internet-based tasks just made sense (and was a lot cheaper).Usefulness- The battery life is nothing like an Apple counterpart, but it still holds a decent charge. Carry a battery pack and a charger cable, and you should be fine for the day.+ It connects to hot-spots well, so if you can use the internet on your phone or connect to wifi, then you should be capable of achieving access to the internet without needing to add a line with your carrier.I am very happy about the purchase.",14 people found this helpful

It's not good for extensive schoolwork but can be used for some. I got it to hold my digital textbooks and record my lectures as I took notes on my computer. Any app that works on your phone (Android only) works on the tablet. Really good for travel or for something just a little bit bigger than a phone (it is not very big). I use Bluetooth headphones and speakers almost exclusively and it connects so well. It also had a headphone jack. Its Wi-Fi connectivity was good. It even connects to my sketchy campus Wi-Fi. It has a long-lasting battery life (I could use it for 3 days before needing to charge it in most cases), though certain apps will drain it faster just like any other device.",18 people found this helpful
"SAMSUNG Galaxy Tab A7 Lite 8.7"" 32GB WiFi Android Tablet w/ Long Lasting Battery, Compact, Slim Design, Sturdy Metal Frame, US VersonGray",4.0,Perfectly satisfactory tablet; terrible setup routine,"Reviewed in the United States on February 18, 2023",Style: WiFi Tablet | Color: Gray,True,"The tablet is just fine. But the setup procedure is so frustrating that I almost sent it back. The problem is that after you go through the setup steps that you encounter when you first turn the device on--and the device tells you that you are all set--they download update after update in the background. If you try to download the app for which you bought the tablet--say, Kindle--the device just appears to hang. The same if you try to download a book to your Kindle. If you pull down the notifications panel you get a hint about what's going on, but nothing to suggest that the process is going to bring your device to its knees. It is this sneaky kind of bandwidth theft that I waists my time trying to figure out that really frustrates me. If they had just said, ""Look, we have to download a bunch of updates. It will take about an hour. So just set the device aside and do something else until we finish,"" I would have been perfectly satisfied. It is the way they mislead you that is unacceptable. It's also unnecessary. Stupid!",58 people found this helpful

"SAMSUNG Galaxy Tab A7 Lite 8.7"" 32GB WiFi Android Tablet w/ Long Lasting Battery, Compact, Slim Design, Sturdy Metal Frame, US VersonGray",4.0,Great - for the price,"Reviewed in the United States on February 1, 2023",Style: WiFi Tablet w/Cover | Color: Silver,True,"I really like this tablet for what I paid for it (at the time it was on sale for $99) - it does everything I need.  HOWEVER - it's a bottom of the line product and there are a few places where it shows:Lagginess - booting up, installing apps, opening apps is slow.  However once the tablet settles down and has everything loaded, it runs fine.Touchscreen - a little bit of lag on the touchscreen too.Display- good enough but not incredibly sharp.  Pales compared to say an iPhone or a more expensive android phone.With that said the tablet was extremely inexpensive and is great for basic use.  Simple games, shows, web browsing all work well.  There is an actual headphone jack, which is great to have these days.  It's a good size and weight, not too large to be unwieldy but more comfortable for viewing than a phone.I think this tablet is an extremely good value despite its flaws.  I would buy it again for my needs and recommend it for anyone looking for something inexpensive for casual use.",34 people found this helpful

The build quality and screen clarity/brightness are well up to these tasks, and the 3Gb RAM, which sounds puny, actually handles them quite nicely. I happened to have a 32Gb microSD card lying around, so I popped that in and formatted it easily, thus doubling my storage capacity. Since I'm not downloading movies or installing games, a total 64Gb of storage should be all I need for the life of the product. I tend to replace these kinds of things every 2 or 3 years.

My only downfall is that there isn't a lot of space, so they've started running slower already. But that's something I should've looked into before buying, and I plan on getting an SD card to help with that issue. My daughter has not stopped using it since we've bought it. Definitely a lot better than the previous 4 tablets we have bought.

"SAMSUNG Galaxy Tab A7 Lite 8.7"" 32GB WiFi Android Tablet w/ Long Lasting Battery, Compact, Slim Design, Sturdy Metal Frame, US VersonGray",5.0,Amazing Tablet,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on November 24, 2022",Style: WiFi Tablet | Color: Gray,True,"I originally wanted to buy this at a Warehouse that starts with a “S’ and rhymes with “Ram’s Rub,” because they had it for $100. When I bought it and purchased it, I asked the dude at the electronic gate to pick up my item. He the directed me to the exit door to pick it up. Confused, I went to the guy scanning the receipt and told him what the “smart man” in the green vest told me. The dude also looked confused and contacted someone to help me out. After some back and forth, he told me the guy in the green vest (the same one who told me to go that way), would help me. I walked back to the gate and waited for the genius to show up. He then looked  up my item and saw that it was out and “would not sell me the display model,” as he sternly told me right after. He tried to sell me a different tablet (because he thinks he gets commission off up selling) and I told him that this tablet was the newest model (the other Samsung tablet came out in 2017) and I prefer that one. Ignoring what I said, he then explained to me “Next time you buy an electronic, you need to ask someone if they have it first.” Since there is no employee that works in electronics at this place, was I to bother a cashier or the lady who folds clothes? Or did I need to ask King Green Vest if I can partake of a tablet. I ordered my tablet from Amazon since when they tell you it is in stock, you do not need “make sure it is in stock.”That being said, the table is amazing. Display is nice, 1080p looks good on this small size. Battery lasts awhile, as most Samsung tablets do. The sensitivity may be not to my liking, but it could be due to the screen protector. But I would recommend this tablet for anyone who wants a smaller size and nothing too bulky. Since I have a Samsung phone, I could sync it up and receive texts and calls on it too.",61 people found this helpful

You have to understand that I am a foster parent, and one of the things we do right away is get the new kiddos a small, simple tablet to help with anxiety.  We previously bought the Amazon fire tablets, but for the small price increase, you get a much much much better tablet with the Samsung.  The screens are bullet proof, battery is rock solid, runs an android os which means there is a wide variety of apps and controls available.  Our oldest one is going on 2 years and it gets used, and I mean used heavily.  The battery is still lasting more than 8 hours, the touch screen is worn in the heavy use areas but still working fine.  The cases are widely available and cheap.  I think the cases I buy for them are $10.00.  If you need one right away, the Amazon renewed service is great.  Those tablets are easily as good as the brand new ones and we haven't had any issues.  I purchased these brand new on a black friday deal for $98.00.  At that price, we stock up and get several.  We also run Google Family link and that control app is seamless between these tablets and my iPhone 13.  You just have to open a google email for the kids.

Nothing crazy. With that being said, it's definitely a steal of a product. Last tablet I knew that went for around 100 bucks was a bad joke! This one is a quality tablet for the tag though. Good picture quality. Speaker placed on the top and bottom so when in landscape mode, you get that surround sound feeling/effect. Don't get carried away though. They're still just tablet speakers. Lol. My only quarrel is that it has a tendency to lag upon certain actions like switching apps or pulling up the keyboard or typing the first 2 characters. There seems to be a slight delay. I would say about a ½ to ¾ of a second. Battery seems decent. Haven't really been able to dive into it as far as charging time and battery length. But it does hold a charge something serious though. I've been watching live baseball games all day and I only needed the charger twice for the day.

The other two were knocked off because it won't activate on Verizon's service or a pay as you go service. That ain't good!I wanted a LTE tablet in my vehicle to run Maps and do the random Google search when required so I bought this as it wasn't too expensive and has a bigger screen than my phone. During setup when it came to activating the LTE service a message popped up saying that it couldn't be done and I traded out the SIM for bring your own tablet, pay as you go, one and it popped up a message saying it couldn't be activated on their service.... no bueno.I read other reviews that had the same information but figured I'd try my luck as I've been fairly successful in getting things to function when other couldn't. Trust the reviews, they ain't lying. The tablet itself is good and functions like it's supposed to but there are cheaper versions for a straight WIFI tablet than paying for a LTE one and then not being able to use it. I just said the heck with it and went to a Verizon store and bought the same tablet from them already activated. The model numbers between the two tablets are the same so that wasn't the issue. I didn't bother trying to call Verizon to get this tablet running on LTE, it just wasn't worth my time and I didn't have it to waste anyway.I did keep this tablet and use it for a E-Reader for work instead of my more expensive Tab S7 FE and it's a good little tablet... no complaints with that.

"SAMSUNG Galaxy Tab A7 Lite 8.7"" 32GB WiFi Android Tablet w/ Long Lasting Battery, Compact, Slim Design, Sturdy Metal Frame, US VersonGray",2.0,(Update: Bug is fixed now) 32 GB crippled by Samsung’s Android 12 update,"Reviewed in the United States on December 18, 2022",Style: WiFi Tablet | Color: Gray,True,"Update:  As of the OS update that dropped on 1/31/23, you can now move big apps that you don’t want to take up all of your internal storage to the SD card.  As I say below, this is absolutely vital for the 32GB version of this tablet.  This doesn’t change the fact that it’s generally a slower tablet than some of its similarly priced competitors, but the 32GB version of the tablet is no longer a hundred dollar paperweight if you need more than two or three apps.  I’d up the star rating a bit if the tablet wasn’t more expensive now than it was over the holidays.Original review below:This would be.a decent (if slow) entry level Android tablet but for the fact that Samsung’s update to Android 12 broke the ability to move apps to the SD card.  Since a lot of the 32GB is used up by the preinstalled software, this means you have very little room for adding apps.  You can still store media (movies, music, etc,) on the SD card, but you will still run out of space for apps almost immediately after getting the tablet.Avoid buying this tablet in the 32GB version until Samsung fixes this bug - if they ever do.The screen quality is not very good.  I’m not talking about the resolution (It’s low, but you can look at the resolution in the product description so it’s not a surprise), but I’ve noticed uneven backlighting near the screen edges (which can be annoying watching movies or using dark mode in dark environments) on several samples of this Samsung tablet.  I haven’t seen these issues on competitor tablets even at the same price point, so this appears to be a Samsung thing.Sound quality from the two built-in speakers isn’t very good either - even with the supposed Dolby Atmos features enabled - but is okay for basic media watching.The tablet is pretty sluggish - probably partly from limited RAM (3 GB in the 32GB storage version) and partly a sluggish processor.  Don’t expect to be running newer games at full speed on this tablet, though older and less demanding games should be okay.Even the non-cellular versions of this tablet have a GPS which works pretty well, so you can use this tablet for offline mapping with various offline maps apps from the play store.  Came in handy for a recent Nevada trip.",

As an Android user love that it navigates exactly the same way as my phone. But being able to access free kid games from Google Play Store is what sold me. We have kindle and use kids unlimited  for a while. Seemed that every game we downloaded was just a sample and kids hit a paywall after a short period of play. Then many games were subscription based and that wasn't acceptable. After all was already paying for kids unlimited. On this Samsung we downloaded PBS games for free and the grand kids (5 year olds) have yet to explore everything during last visits. Keeps them busy when needed plus educational.,19 people found this helpful

I transitioned from an Lenovo M8 to this one.  My pro's and con's use the Levovo M8 for most comparisons and a 2016 Apple Ipad for one or two.Pro's1.  Faster than the Lenovo M8, slower than a 2016 Ipad 9.7 inch.  My most used application is Kindle and Kindle is much faster on the Samsung A7 Lite.  I also read the local paper on a tablet daily.  The A7 Lite turns pages very slowly.  Enough so that it's impractical for this use.  I use the Ipad for this.2.  Good selection of apps3.  Able to expand memory using an SD card and some applications can be moved to the SD card.  I have Kindle on the SD card and it performs well.Con's1.  Limited feature set.

Since the screen can only handle 1080p it’s not mind blowing picture quality when streaming or gaming. And more noticeably is how it needs to catch up often with simple things like managing running apps or simply just closing an app. The screen controls are simple enough so if you’re an Apple user switching doesn’t feel very foreign. You can also transfer some data from iCloud to this tablet which has been pretty useful. My tablet doesn’t have much internal storage so an SD card, for me at least, gives me nothing to worry about if I need more space in the future.

I honestly wasn't expecting much as a Tab A, but I really like these! They come automatically with 32g of storage, which is great when downloading a bunch of games and apps that hog storage. Add an SD card and you're golden for a while. In particular was a messaging app that allows us to video chat as a family of 4 - the tablets do not have a lag even with 4 on video at the same time and show a clear picture using the front facing camera. And the battery lasts for what seems like forever - the first day with a full charge, it was used for over 4 hours (per the parental app we also downloaded) with videos and games, and still had over half of the charge. And as far as the size, you wouldn't think going from a 7"" screen to an 8"" screen would really make a difference, but it really does. The colors are vivid and bright. I can't speak for the tech stuff, but as a daily tablet to run games and videos and surf the internet and video chat, this really is great. I'm going to return and purchase another for myself to replace an old Nook.",

"SAMSUNG Galaxy Tab A7 Lite 8.7"" 32GB WiFi Android Tablet w/ Long Lasting Battery, Compact, Slim Design, Sturdy Metal Frame, US VersonGray",1.0,3 three tablets purchased all three tablets failed within a year...,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on March 23, 2023",Style: WiFi Tablet | Color: Silver,True,"I purchased two of these tablets a year ago and both ""failed to turn on"" literally one week after they were out of warranty. It seems as if it was almost designed to happen. Do to the crunch of needing these tablets for my day to day dealings I purchased a new one while I figured out what to do next with the two that failed. This newest one I purchased ""failed to turn on"" in UNDER A MONTH of receiving it!So, I sent all three in for service two weeks ago through Samsung. I was told that each one had to have the PBA-Main replaced, which is a power board/mother board according to the Samsung rep. Not only that but each one had physical damage. ""Dented corners and scratches"" which also led to their failures.I assure you, all of these units were pristine in condition. They were housed in protective cases and had screen protectors on each. The only activity they saw would be comparable to light office work. No adverse environments nor conditions. The kicker is the packaging I sent them in for repair was light years better then what I received them back in.https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09NXW6K6V/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0922DRRBT/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1So longer story longer the newest tablet is under warranty and was repaired without charge but the rub to that is now the tablet has gone form a 1yr warranty to only a 30 day warranty since it has been serviced.The original two will cost $100 each to repair and will receive a 30 day warranty for only the repairs that are made.Moral of the story...the tablets accomplished what I needed to them to do for the time that they were operational. I'm disappointed that they failed and soon as they did and that the cost to repair them is only $20 dollars less than the purchase price of a brand new one that includes a warranty.Will I be buying a new replacement? NO. Will I have them repaired? Also, NO.Hopefully this review helps you in your decision. Buyer beware.",5 people found this helpful

If I bought again I would have purchased the upgrade in ram built in. While the 3 is ok the 32 g is to small . I added 128 to Sim slot , you need this on android.

Also its alarm to wake you up is very strange, for some reason, a couple days when I really needed the alarm it did not set off. I cleaned the cache today and hope it will work better. Also the alarm is not easy to manage, such as, it has very small line to let you snooze for another 5 minutes, my old Lenovo has a big zzz icon you can touch it and continue snoozing.

I know there are Google work arounds which I did not want to do.-Even in a case, the Samsung table screen must be manually turned on each time you want to use it, unlike the Fires whose case turns the screen on and off when flipped open and shut.-Battery life is very low compared to that of the Fires.-Some apps, like the DuoLingo which I use a lot, work wonderfully well on the Fires, just as on my PC. However, on the Samsung tablet they do not work correctly all the time, and in fact force the user into additional purchases unless he pays money or ""lose all the work done so far""-One nice thing about the Samsung tablet is at least the case I had fit and functioned properly.

"SAMSUNG Galaxy Tab A7 Lite 8.7"" 32GB WiFi Android Tablet w/ Long Lasting Battery, Compact, Slim Design, Sturdy Metal Frame, US VersonGray",3.0,A tech step backwards,"Reviewed in the United States on November 29, 2021",Style: WiFi Tablet | Color: Gray,True,"I'm a huge Samsung fan, but this product was a huge disappointment. I was looking to upgrade my Samsung Tab S2, which has a 4:3 ratio screen and a sharp AMOLED display, with the A7.  Here are the issues:1. Screen. The screen is a dull, lifeless, non-sharp TFT display like you used to find in laptops.  The screen looks nothing like what you see on the website or on phones such as the S21.  The 16:9 ratio screen only provides for a 6x5 icon layout, which is not even as good as the Tab S2.  That means a lot of wasted space.  I also fail to see the value of the long narrow screen for anything but movies.  It is not good as a book reader.2.  Weight. The tablet feels bulky and heavy.3. No Samsung email app.  For some reason, the Samsung email app is not only not included, but is also not compatible with this device (and notwithstanding that it has been on prior tablets like the Tab S2 and on phones such as the S9 and S21).  This by itself made the device unaccpeable.  The Samsung email app easily interfaced with Exchange servers and other email providers such as Verizon.  Syncing Exchange contact and calendar folders via the Samsung email app meant that the native Android Contacts and Calenadar apps would be immediately populated with data.  No replacement email app will do that.I don't know the target audience for this product, but it is certainly not anyone looking for a high-performance small tablet with a great screen.",7 people found this helpful

It's plenty fast enough for light workloads, has excellent battery, is lightweight and a great size, and has expandable storage. I've disabled most of the Samsung and Google services and it's very fast and responsive, and the fairly limited internal storage hasn't been an issue for my use case, particularly since I can store media files on a microSD card. If you're looking for a cheap lightweight tablet, this is honestly a really great option.My *one* major complaint is that the display resolution is really too low for the size, with very blurry text rendering particularly on serif fonts. For most content it works fine, and increasing the font size in epubs and such works fine to avoid this, but if you're going to use it to read fixed-layout PDFs or comics/manga with small text, it may be an issue.",6 people found this helpful

"SAMSUNG Galaxy Tab A7 Lite 8.7"" 32GB WiFi Android Tablet w/ Long Lasting Battery, Compact, Slim Design, Sturdy Metal Frame, US VersonGray",1.0,"Was good, then “poof”, an upgrade makes this tablet worthless…UPDATE","Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on September 19, 2022",Style: WiFi Tablet | Color: Gray,True,"After working with at least three Samsung ""technical agents"", I was told that the SD card is a ""known issue"" and there was nothing that could be done about it at this time. I evaluated the use of this product without the use of the SD card and decided that it was useless.  Since the best they could do was offer me a higher priced product that would do what this was supposed to do, I decided that getting rid of it was my best option.  Frankly, the limitations created by not being able to use the SD card make this product pretty worthless, and the Amazon Kindle will work much better for much less money. So, I dumped this tab on the last day.  I will be looking at either the iPad Mini if I can get by with my one drive or the Surface pro from Microsoft if I need the SD. I would stay with Kindle, but the software limitations are super irritating and ridiculous.  Samsung really let me down on this one.This product was working well for me, and I was in the store by programs onto my SD card. Then android came along with an update and suddenly nothing worked. All of the programs that I put on my SD card became nonfunctional and I had to reinstall them. Further, I was no longer able to store any programs or memory from programs onto the SD card. That means, the SD card is useless to me. I contacted Samsung and talked to them and they have confirmed there is no update for this and the only thing I can do is take my tablet in and have the old software put back on it. That solves nothing as any time there’s an upgrade I don’t get the benefit of the upgrade and if I do I lose the ability of the SD card. So why provide a tablet with an SD card up to a terabyte if I can’t use it? Samsung tells me they’re aware of the problem but they’re not able to tell me of any plans to fix it.Of course, you can buy one of the more expensive tablets and you won’t be affected by this issue.",30 people found this helpful

"SAMSUNG Galaxy Tab A7 Lite 8.7"" 32GB WiFi Android Tablet w/ Long Lasting Battery, Compact, Slim Design, Sturdy Metal Frame, US VersonGray",5.0,Best budget tablet for 2021 in my opinion.,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on November 19, 2021",Style: WiFi Tablet | Color: Gray,True,"This tablet is a budget tablet. But with that being said, it offers quite a bang for the buck. 32 gb of internal storage. Which is important for apps. Expandable memory to up to 1 tb to store all your photos, movies, music and more. A good quality screen. A powerful processor, octa core 2.3 ghz runs games with very little to no lag. 3 gb of ram which is so much better than the usual 2 gb. The only drawbacks to this tablet is the screen although good is not as good as previous tablets in the series. But it's good enough. And there is no flash on the camera. I only liked that for the flashlight feature. This tablet has a hefty battery that will run for you all day without a charge. And one of the best things about this tablet is the dual stereo speakers on either side horizontal that makes movie watching like being at the theater. Get this tablet!",52 people found this helpful

My son likes to watch some of his children’s shows on it and the sound quality is great. Since its storage capacity is low, I bought an SD micro card to add more storage in the event I needed it.

She had the Amazon kids fire tablet for a few years but then I decided to get her a ""big girl tablet"" for her 8th birthday. She was limited with the fire tablet and I wanted her to be able to use her school learning apps on her tablet. I know it can be a little scary to give them a tablet with access to the entire Internet. However, the samsung is a good size tablet for her. The family link app is great and setting up all the parental controls on the tablet was easy. I speak with her about being safe on the Internet and I was able to set up the tablet to do things like request my approval before she can download things. Overall, I think it's a great tablet for a kid and would be great for an adult as well for basic use.Update: soon after purchasing this tablet we noticed the camera kept crashing. I would restart it and try other ways to fix but the app still crashes and the camera has pretty much not worked since we bought it. Very disappointing because she uses the camera to call her dad, family members and friends and it doesn't work. I didn't want to send it back after setting it all up and everything else has worked great.",9 people found this helpful

It won’t turn on and won’t indicate a charge. We’ve gone through all troubleshooting with Samsung. Since it’s out of the 1 year warranty period it will cost us $180 to fix per the Samsung tech. Nothing I can do about it other than write this review and hope you steer clear of Samsung altogether. We are a household full of Samsung tech including TV, Refrigerator, watch and 4 tablets. You should also note, Samsung began making it impossible to put anything other than media (videos/photos) on the external memory (SD Card). This makes the internal memory fill up with the apps/games and you can’t put them on the SD card to free up space. Altogether a miserable experience with this tablet.

However, as a last ditch effort, we took the tablet to a local Verizon store. As others have written, they tested the tablet with an activated SIM to confirm that the tablet was compatible, and then activated a new SIM out-of-band and then installed that in the tablet.This is for a Galaxy Tab A7 Lite tablet,  ASIN B0971TGSRJ that purchased new from amazon.com. Verizon says the SMT227UZAA module number printed on the box is a Verizon compatible tablet but the IMEI # on the box and on the tablet is not in Verizon's database and Verizon says it won't work on their network and they cannot activate the tablet. The model number displayed on the Android Settings->About page is SM-T227U without the ZAA suffix.

These are nice devices that are good for basic stuff including playing audio and video media.  They have above average audio.

I found a few problems - the most annoying was the inability to move apps from internal to external SD.  The capacity for 32 GB was pretty bad once you install streaming software like Netflix, HBO and Prime.  These apps will not work on the SD chip.  I read there's an off market app manager to move apps to the SD chip.  I don't know why Samsung hamstrings their internal drive.  I had all my photos and documents stored on my SD chip.I went to the Samsung website to try to find a fix for this tablet.  I have to mail it in for repairs. There are local repair shops in my home town.  The cost to analyze the tablet is $80 credited to repair. I went through the entire process to reboot and restart.  I followed all the advice Samsung offered.I contacted Samsung and went to Tacoma to get in line and have my tablet evaluated.  Their cost was $49 credited to repair as well.  After an initial look, they decided it would cast me $179 for a repair because the issue was neither the charge port or the battery.  It was the motherboard. The tablet is toast and now is a throw away.  I gave it to recycling.Later,  I ordered another that was 64GB. Then, I discovered it was a 64GB SD chip and a 32GB internal drive.  My new device is the same as the old one with a larger SD chip.I like what the tablet can do when it works.  It's a good size to use to travel and I like that it's only a wifi. It's a little better to read emails or kindle than on a cell phone.  My S21 cell phone does all the photos, texting and calls I want.",3 people found this helpful

"SAMSUNG Galaxy Tab A7 Lite 8.7"" 32GB WiFi Android Tablet w/ Long Lasting Battery, Compact, Slim Design, Sturdy Metal Frame, US VersonGray",5.0,The Good and the Bad,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on September 20, 2021",Style: WiFi Tablet | Color: Gray,False,"THE GOOD:It's the only Galaxy Tablet that's small and ideal for reading (like a paperback novel).  There is no competition other than Lenovo possibly that really competes unless you want to spend $$$ for an Ipad Mini.  Great with Amazon Kindle, and the Readly App ($9.99 a month for unlimited magazines, US/UK.So you get 3GB AND 32GB Storage.  Is it enough?  If you're buying it for games wellllll probably not.BREAKING NEWS!But just recently and by recently I'm talking as of September 2021, Samsung has sent an update to the A7 Lite which now enables you to switch APPS to your SD card.  (Their ad states this, so either they made good on their promise, or the lawyers finally worked out a copyright issue they had in the US).  I load maybe 4 to 6 games and still have plenty of space in addition to all my streaming.  It just takes a moment to make sure your storage (photos, music, docs (to MS Office's Cloud service One Drive), are off the actual unit.  A 64GB mini SD isn't that much maybe $20 and should be enough along with the cloud services you probably already use.Everything (other than the load time for Asphalt 9) works great.  I use this Tablet quite a bit for work.Case??  I don't use one.  If I was traveling with it, I might, but the whole deal with this tablet is how light and small it is.  Just my thing, if I break it, I got this for $129, I'm sure if it isn't, it'll be on sale again soon for the same price.  Battery lasts a long time and the charging is pretty quick, a few hours, it's not speedy but it works.  The case isn 't plastic like the Fire Tablets, it's metal/aluminum and the build quality like all Samsung devices is impeccable (I accidently sat on my Galaxy Flex A laptop and not a scratch).Sound: Great, better than my 5th gen Ipad, 2 speakers.  Being Deaf in one ear, allows for Mono audio, appreciated Android devs!Useful-Runs my Lights, temperature, automated household appliances.  Also works fantastic with my Fire TV as a remote (keyboard)THE BADPALM REJECTION-There is none.  You have to use your nubby bulbous pen straight and you can get used to it.  (I""m left handed so I'm not sure if right handed people would be more effected, I imagine it's the same).  I'm writing this review on my Samsung Galaxy Flex A Laptop which allows me to use a Surface Pro pen, I just wish Samsung would have allowed this via their Bluetooth connection on the A7 lite.  But I get it, they want you to buy the S series for $400 more.  Btw of which none are 8"" tablets.I use this at work (information technology)  for note taking, it's small and portable to write quickly onto my one note (once I got used to the way I need to use the pen).SMUDGY FINGER PRINT MAGNET-Either get a solution of 2 drops of dishwasher fluid 1 part Alcohol and 2 parts water in a spray bottle, and a glass wipe (Dollar stores), or buy the portable lens wipes (Target has the good ones for about $3.99 USD).  You'll be using them a LOT!LOAD TIME FROM STARTUP-I don't mind that I have to wait for it to load, but when I wait for it to load and then go to enter my passcode and then have to wait for it to load AGAIN, that's just some software dev having a bad day and deciding to take it out on the user.OVERALLBad points aside I prefer this tablet over my Gen 5 Ipad.  Mine blown that this little light thing has 8 cores if you think about not too long ago dual core was pretty amazing engineering.",9 people found this helpful

Screen colors and clarity...I watch a lot of YouTube videos and I discovered that the colors are excellent and the videos are very vivid. The screen is bright and clear!3. I purchased a Stylus with a Disc Tip on Amazon and it handwrites well in Samsung Notes, Squid App and HW App.4. A 3.5 Jack for wired headsets, great for listening to music apps, I prefer this to Bluetooth headphones.5. It accepts a SD Card up to 1TB. I installed a 256gb with my music files, etc.6. With 32gb Internal, I just installed useful Playstore Apps and I still have about 13.5gb left. I didn't install any games.7. Although this is a BASIC TABLET, it performs well and it is a great deal at 129.00.8. Battery Life...I was happily surprised because the battery lasts all day, even when I watch a lot of videos.9.

"SAMSUNG Galaxy Tab A7 Lite 8.7"" 32GB WiFi Android Tablet w/ Long Lasting Battery, Compact, Slim Design, Sturdy Metal Frame, US VersonGray",3.0,"Almost great, but fundamentally flawed","Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on August 3, 2021",Style: WiFi Tablet | Color: Gray,False,"At the time of this review, this tablet is listed for $129. Some reviews here are complaining about the screen, but the hardware is an excellent value for money. The screen may not be the highest resolution, but it's good enough for most media consumption uses and it is bright. The lower resolution will probably only affect you if you are reading relatively small text.  The build quality in total is very high for this price point. It's a thin, primarily metal, body that feels pretty solid in your hand.The problem with the tablet (and the reason I returned mine) comes down to a limitation put in place by Samsung's software. Samsung has acknowledged that the ""US Variant"" of their galaxy tablets do not allow formatting SD cards as internal storage or moving apps to external storage. This means that your app storage is limited by the built-in device storage. This tablet has 32GB of storage, but about 15 of that is taken by the system and you are left with only 17. This simply is not enough space for apps on a tablet bought in 2021.To be clear, this is not an android limitation or an app limitation, it is a limitation put in place by Samsung.  If you look around online you will find advice from people (who presumably don't own this tablet) telling you how to move some android apps to an SD card, but that advice does not apply on this device. Even if the app developer has explicitly enabled the ability to move an app to external storage and even if you have moved the same app on another android device, it will not work here. Not even enabling developer options or trying to use ADB to move apps will resolve this problem.There is a 64GB version of this tablet available from Samsung that is currently bouncing back and forth between a list price of $199 and sale price of $149. If you are considering this tablet, I would highly recommend spending the extra $20 and getting the higher model It has twice as much storage, but since the system reserved space doens't change, you effectively go from 17gb for apps to 49gb for apps. This is much more workable given the SD card limitations.","1,641 people found this helpful"

"SAMSUNG Galaxy Tab A7 Lite 8.7"" 32GB WiFi Android Tablet w/ Long Lasting Battery, Compact, Slim Design, Sturdy Metal Frame, US VersonGray",5.0,Kids love them!!,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on January 18, 2022",Style: WiFi Tablet | Color: Gray,True,Tired of kids using my tablet so got them their own.  The screen clarity in the specs bothered me (as it was much less pixels that my Samsung S2 Tab) but I was pleasantly surprised that the screen clarity is quite GOOD!!  There is really not much difference between their tablets and my older tablet.  So that is a BIG PLUS.  Price was great too..almost half of what mine cost years ago.  Great value in Tablets.  Would not hesitate to buy again.,3 people found this helpful

"SAMSUNG Galaxy Tab A7 Lite 8.7"" 32GB WiFi Android Tablet w/ Long Lasting Battery, Compact, Slim Design, Sturdy Metal Frame, US VersonGray",3.0,"Not bad, but Samsung seems to be removing features....","Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on April 1, 2022",Style: WiFi Tablet | Color: Gray,True,"This is a bit of nitpick, but I suspect others have questions about this, so I think I'm doing a bit of public service by pointing this out (if I'm wrong, I hope someone points this out).1.  Overall, the quality of the tablet is quite good, given the price point.  It is probably the best of the ""budget"" tablets, but it is also more expensive than its competitors (thinking mostly of Lenovo M8), so I guess that's fairly even.2.  One particularly disappointing feature is that the ""smart view"" functionality seems to have been discontinued.  There used to be an icon called ""Smart view"" in older Samsung tablets that enabled screen mirroring via Miracast.  Not sure if it's gone from Samsung tablets across the board or just from budget models, but, while, apparently A7 Lite used to have this feature, it is no longer present (at least) in the current version.  No ""obvious"" means of mirroring screen now, and it might be the way of the future, alas.#2 is not a dealbreaker for me since Miracast still works on Windows machines (and an older Samsung tablet) and I'm perfectly happy with what this tablet was bought for.  But that it has disappeared and that a lot of (apparently) outdated websites that ""helpfully"" show how to use this functionality are still around providing misleading information is a bit disappointing.  If a major corporation like Samsung does away with what I gather was a very popular feature, it should make sure that people know if the functionality has been removed.Edit:  Samsung tech who answered my phone call was insistent that the screen mirroring feature is still there and, if the feature does not show up after updating everything (and doing a factory reset and updating everything), that means something is wrong and that I should return it for replacement.  It didn't show up after updating everything, then doing a factory reset then updating everything.  So I am doing exactly that and will report back if the situation changes when the replacement device comes in.Edit #2:  The replacement device came in, but exactly the same problem.  Repeated the same process as I was told by the tech the other day, and still the same thing.  Called Samsung again, and another tech tells me that the previous tech was wrong and that the feature indeed has been discontinued for all Samsung tablets (i.e. only phones now have that feature).  A lot of contradictory information out there, including from Samsung techs themselves over past 48-72 hours.  So it seems that the final word is that there is no screen mirroring capability on Samsung tablets any more, cheap or expensive, it seems.  Samsung really needs to get the story straightened out!  Like I mentioned in the first version of the review, screen mirroring is not a feature that is essential to me, so it's not a deal breaker by itself, but it is convenient enough feature for me that not having it is really disappointing.  It seems that Samsung is not what it used to be if its own tech support ppl don't seem to know what's really going on with their products.  (I'd figure that screen mirroring is popular enough feature that people will want to know about this! :( )",4 people found this helpful

Mind you, I have already tried a few cheap Android tablets already, some from no-name brands and some from well-known brands... all of which I immediately returned after such a horrible experience. Basically anything available under $100 is such a compromise - these tablets are usually made from all plastic, with a super slow chip, a mediocre touch screen, economy-build quality, and a slow and unresponsive operating system. In other words, the literal definition of CHEAP.However, the Galaxy Tab A7 Lite is none of those; for a little over $100 you get a much better experience overall! The build quality is nice, the aluminum body doesn't look or feel tacky, the touch screen is pretty responsive, and you get a smooth Android experience. Even if this is Samsung's lowest-priced tablet, it is a capable performer and a pretty good value. While it doesn't have 4k HDR and isn't powerful enough to play many AAA games, that isn't what I bought it for and that isn't what it was meant to do. I needed a simple, capable Android tablet and I found what I was looking for here; This is the difference between being ""cheap"" and being ""low-cost""!When there are deals (which is often) you can pick up the Tab A7 Lite for about $100-110.

"SAMSUNG Galaxy Tab A7 Lite 8.7"" 32GB WiFi Android Tablet w/ Long Lasting Battery, Compact, Slim Design, Sturdy Metal Frame, US VersonGray",5.0,"Surprisingly good, although perhaps not worth it at full price","Reviewed in the United States on October 28, 2022",Style: WiFi Tablet | Color: Gray,True,"For context, I purchased this tablet on sale for $109.00. Additionally, I have been using Samsung Galaxy S series phones for a decade, previously used a Samsung tablet from about 2013-2015, and currently use both a Fire HD 8 (2020 model) tablet and a Fire 7 (2019 model) tablet. Finally, I purchased this because I needed a tablet with access to Google Play Services for a specific set of purposes.First of all, it's important to keep in mind that the Galaxy A series is Samsung's ""budget"" line of tablets and smartphones, and this is the cheapest of their tablets. The performance is not going to be as good as the flagship Series S or Series Z devices; if you have, for example, an S22 as your phone, you should not expect the performance of this tablet, the screen, etc to match that. It also is not going to meet the specs and quality of iPads, Surfaces, or other high-end tablets. That being said, Android tablets overall are much better quality than they were several years ago, which my experience with this tablet has confirmed for me.The screen is good--much better than I expected. Everything is clear and sharp, and there's basically no pixilation. It does have a lower pixel density than a lot of other devices, but more than most budget Android tablets. The screen can also be slightly difficult to view from certain angles, although that shouldn't be an issue for 99% of use cases; it can also be a bit difficult to see in brighter lights. In terms of physical qualities, it's basically the same as the screen on my S21.The sound is also better than I expected. It doesn't seem to carry as far as other devices--once again, not a huge issue--but it's loud and clear. The fact that there's an audio jack is appreciated, and one can always connect a speaker or headphones via bluetooth.The extra 1GB of RAM compared to my Fire HD 8 is definitely noticeable in most cases, although this is still not what I would call a speedy device. If you're just watching video, listening to audio, and reading, this will be irrelevant to you outside of saving a second or so when you open an app, pull up the keyboard, or turn on the tablet. I have not played any games on it, but I assume that more demanding ones would have some noticeable difficulties on this.Battery life seems great so far. The tablet supports fast charging, but the included charger does not.The tablet is lightweight, although compared to my Fire HD 8, it is not as comfortable to hold. The materials used are also very nice, and it doesn't look or feel like a budget tablet. It's small enough that fitting it into most bags or purses shouldn't be difficult. The fact that storage is also expandable up to 1 TB is appreciated. The charging port is USB-C, which is basically standard nowadays, although many budget devices still use micro-USB, so it's worth mentioning.The cameras are adequate, and are fine for Zoom, Skype, and other video sites. I have not used the microphone, but I assume it's also serviceable.There are seemingly some interesting options to connect this to a Samsung phone, although I am not using those. Still, this could be a nice option for some people.Unfortunately, there do not seem to be very many good cases available for this model. There do appear to be a lot of ""heavy-duty"" cases for it though, which is nice if you're purchasing this for a young child.Overall, if you can get this on sale--especially if you *have* to have access to Google Play Services or otherwise can't or don't want to use Fire OS--this is definitely a great choice for a tablet. It will get updates and remain usable for far longer than similarly-priced and cheaper Android tablets from Onn, Chinese manufacturers using the names of old American brands, and the like. That being said, if you're primarily looking for a device for consuming content--which is what the overwhelming majority of people use tablets for--I'd still recommend the Fire HD 8, especially during one of the many times per year that it goes on sale, as I don't feel that the differences are worth the extra $50.00-$110.00 the A7 Lite will cost. Still, this is probably the best inexpensive Android tablet on the market today, and is a fantastic option to consider if you're looking to purchase one.",456 people found this helpful

Period. Wasn't planning to use it for anything else. After two days, I find myself using it for almost everything, including texts and phone calls (I have a Samsung A52 phone, so I can ""mirror"" calls and texts with the tablet). I am 63, and my eyes and fingers don't work as well as they did even a year ago, so I guess the increased size of this device makes a significant difference. I've also decided to redo my music collection in a non-lossy format (flac) so it takes up a good bit more room than mp3 or vorbis, but the music quality is noticeably better (at least to my ears) and if I need more space I can buy a bigger sd card. I thought maybe I should have bought the version that includes cell phone functionality, but I'm glad I didn't. I'll still use my cell when in the car or riding my bicycle for music. For calls using the tablet I either use speakerphone or a bluetooth headset or earbuds. Having both devices increases flexibility. VERY glad I bought this, I should have bought one years ago!

"SAMSUNG Galaxy Tab A7 Lite 8.7"" 32GB WiFi Android Tablet w/ Long Lasting Battery, Compact, Slim Design, Sturdy Metal Frame, US VersonGray",5.0,"A Samsung Galaxy Tab RAVE, from a tough reviewer.","Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on October 28, 2022",Style: WiFi Tablet | Color: Silver,True,"I have had a Samsung tablet since 2015 that I have used every single night (black in the photo, white is new one), sometimes for several hours before bed. It has been BY FAR the best performing electronic device I've ever owned. So when it came time to buy a second tablet for work purposes, I navigated back to Samsung Tabs. After debating the choices for GB size, screen size, and optional pen use in the family of Tabs, I decided on this one. I choose it because while I need performance with office apps, social media, and other apps, I don't need it for heavy graphics use, as in heavy graphics gaming. But as it turns out, it works with hardcore photo editing apps like a champ, no hesitation in speed or performance at all. And the price? There's a lot of value for the money here.What I think: I've had this a month and it's a performance superstar, just like the old one. One giant plus is that you take it out of the box and turn it on, it's already charged so you're good to go within minutes. Set up is so easy that any novice could do it. Wifi connectively is seamless, performance is smooth, takes gorgeous photos, screen colors are rich and crisp, screen refresh is on point, the size is portable, fits a huge variety of tablet covers, holds a charge, Android system assures access across all devices, and the sound quality is very good.  My experience is that Samsung designs ""forward"" for the needs of the everyday consumer (me) which ensures that their devices perform reliably day after day despite the increasing demands of ever-evolving uses. Some devices are designed to obsolete as soon as you open them, but that is just not the case here.I'll always mention any downsides of any product, but I have yet to find a single flaw with this tablet. Just like the last one, I look forward to having it for a long time to come. Highly recommend.",20 people found this helpful
