I was attracted to the screen size have had a 17 inch screen for so long. Set up was easy enough although it took me a few days of tweaking to get the color to my liking. The only thing I didn't like was the sound quality of the built-in speakers.  Not good at all as several other reviews will attest.  I ordered the Amazon brand speakers ( $18) to fix the sound issue.  Other then that no issues at all. I would recommend especially at $99.,
"Sceptre 24"" Professional Thin 75Hz 1080p LED Monitor 2x HDMI VGA Build-in Speakers, Machine Black (E248W-19203R Series)",5.0,**PLEASE READ BEFORE BUYING**,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on May 19, 2022","Style: 24"" 75Hz Blue Light Shift | Pattern: Monitor",True,"I have bought sceptre monitors in the past, and I stand by them as a great budget monitor company if you want something that's reliable and inexpensive. I purchased these monitors as secondary monitors and vertical monitors for my setup. From my experience, I knew that these monitors would be good for work other than gaming, so I primarily use them for watching videos, discord, or just as an extra screen for when I am doing work. I overall enjoy these monitors, but I have two major issues that I had first when I got them.I love the monitors, and they could be a 5-star product if they tweaked a couple of things. I will talk first about the main advantages of the monitors first. Firstly, for $150, you are getting a monitor with decent viewing angles and a good size with 75hz refresh rate viewing. For the price, it is a very good monitor alone for office or schoolwork. It does its job very well and anybody who is doing basic work or maybe some console gaming would have a good experience with these monitors. Furthermore, they are VESA mount* (more on that below), and it has a good display, with a speaker that although quiet, does the job well without sounding blown out. Overall, it is a good monitor, and anybody who wants something basic will enjoy this monitor.Here are the cons from my experience, as it had a couple off the start. I first opened the box to find that it talks about its return policy on the box. This was extremely concerning since it is almost impossible to send this monitor back. Please keep everything (including box and packaging materials) for the first month you own the monitor. The second issue I had was the mounting brackets you get with the monitor. For one thing, the monitor uses a separate monitor arm, that is screwed into a bracket that comes out of the monitor. If you plan on not using any desk mounts or VESA mounting, then you will have no problem with this monitor. However, I wanted to mount this monitor to a VESA desk mount to use as a vertical monitor. My first issue came when I tried to mount the monitor, when I tried to mount the monitor to the arm by screwing in the screws provided with the arm. The first issue comes with the hardware included with the monitor, there are four standoffs and two monitor screws, but the arm needed four screws, so we already are set back. I found some old monitor screws that fit, and when I mounted the monitor, I realized that the monitor wouldn't fit due to the bracket secured on the back, which sticks out of the monitor to make more viewing angles. Again, this won't be an issue for those who are planning on not using any VESA mounting, however, it makes the process a lot more difficult for those who are planning on doing any mounting of their monitor with a third party device. It took me like 20 minutes before I realized that the standoffs that are included are for VESA mounting, which although makes some sense, also makes me question why to include the mounting bracket externally when it could have been included inside of the monitor since there is a cutout section that fits it.I see this question a lot, and I feel that I should address it here for those who want to game on this monitor: get a different monitor. First, this monitor is a 75hz 5ms, meaning it refreshes the screen 75 times in one second, and it responds 5ms after the information has been sent by the PC. There are plenty of 144hz monitors with a 1ms response time for this price, and I recommend that you look for something at that price. If you want something to game on for the long run, get a 144hz monitor at the same price, it'll work better overall, and be around the same budget.Overall I highly enjoy this monitor. I give it four stars since it works very well for what I need it to do, and although it has its flaws I wouldn't want another monitor. It could have been five stars, only if the price was a little bit cheaper. The price does go up with the blue light shift that occurs, but the $133 option is still a little overpriced, I would personally price this around $115 and it would be the ultimate monitor for the price. Overall, if you want a monitor for office work, then please consider this, it's a great monitor.",275 people found this helpful

"Sceptre 24"" Professional Thin 75Hz 1080p LED Monitor 2x HDMI VGA Build-in Speakers, Machine Black (E248W-19203R Series)",4.0,1 Annoying trait costs it a Star,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on February 18, 2023","Style: 24"" 75Hz Blue Light Shift | Pattern: Monitor",True,"I love this little monitor for the price. Perfect for using as an extended desktop for a laptop with an HDMI cable. Great picture quality and the ability to tweak the blue light for nighttime usage. The one thing I cannot figure out how to fix, that costs it 5 stars is that when the current input (HDMI 1) which is plugged into the laptop goes on sleep mode, the input automatically shifts to input 2 (HDMI with a Firestick). The process to switch it back is relatively simple but requires multiple button pushes on the back of the screen and if input 1 is not active immediately will switch right back to input 2. A remote would have made this process a lot easier, but this does not support one.  Same goes with volume.

"Sceptre 24"" Professional Thin 75Hz 1080p LED Monitor 2x HDMI VGA Build-in Speakers, Machine Black (E248W-19203R Series)",2.0,A Decent Option with Disappointing Sound and Design,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on March 27, 2023","Style: 24"" 75Hz | Pattern: Monitor",True,"First of all, let me just say that this monitor is so thin, I'm pretty sure I could snap it in half with my bare hands if I wanted to. But don't worry, I won't do that (yet).The good news is that the picture quality is pretty decent. I mean, it's not like I'm watching a movie on a 4K TV or anything, but for the price, I guess I can't complain too much. The 75Hz refresh rate is also nice, although it's not like I'm playing any games that require lightning-fast reflexes or anything. I'm mostly just using this monitor to watch cat videos on YouTube.Now, onto the bad news. First of all, the built-in speakers are a joke. They sound like they're coming from a tin can that's been kicked around by a bunch of angry toddlers. I mean, I wasn't expecting Bose-quality sound or anything, but come on, Sceptre, you can do better than this.And speaking of sound, let's talk about the noise this thing makes. Every time I turn it on, it emits a high-pitched whine that sounds like a thousand tiny mosquitoes buzzing around my head. I've tried everything to make it stop, but no matter what I do, it just won't go away. So now, every time I want to use my monitor, I have to wear noise-cancelling headphones just to avoid going insane.Finally, let's talk about the design. I mean, I get that it's supposed to be ""professional"" and all, but come on, Sceptre, you can do better than this bland machine black color. Why not make it hot pink or neon green or something? At least then it would be a conversation starter.Overall, I'm giving this monitor two out of five stars. It's not the worst thing I've ever bought, but it's definitely not the best either. If you're looking for a cheap monitor that won't make your ears bleed, this might be a decent option. Just be prepared to wear earplugs and invest in some bright-colored paint.The best monitor parameters depend on your specific needs and preferences. However, here are some common parameters to consider when choosing a monitor:1. Screen size: The size of the monitor determines how much screen real estate you have to work with. Consider how much desk space you have and how much screen size you need to comfortably work.2. Resolution: The resolution of the monitor determines how sharp and clear the image is. Higher resolutions like 4K or 1440p offer sharper images, but also require more powerful hardware to run smoothly.3. Refresh rate: The refresh rate of a monitor determines how many times the screen updates per second. Higher refresh rates like 144Hz or 240Hz offer smoother motion and are preferred for gaming and other fast-paced activities.4. Response time: The response time of a monitor determines how quickly the pixels can change from one color to another. Lower response times like 1ms or 2ms are preferred for gaming and other fast-paced activities.5. Panel type: The panel type of a monitor determines the color accuracy, contrast, and viewing angles. There are three main types of panels: IPS, TN, and VA. IPS panels offer the best color accuracy and viewing angles, while TN panels offer the fastest response times. VA panels offer the best contrast.6. Connectivity: The connectivity options of a monitor determine what devices you can connect to it. Common connectivity options include HDMI, DisplayPort, and USB-C.7. Ergonomics: The ergonomics of a monitor determine how easily you can adjust its position. Consider features like adjustable height, tilt, and swivel to find a comfortable viewing angle.Overall, the best monitor parameters for you will depend on your specific needs and intended use.",

"Sceptre 24"" Professional Thin 75Hz 1080p LED Monitor 2x HDMI VGA Build-in Speakers, Machine Black (E248W-19203R Series)",3.0,A Budget Monitor that Mostly Works OK - Not Recommended,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on November 9, 2022","Style: 24"" 75Hz | Pattern: Monitor",True,"I have had this monitor for only a few days, and I am not very impressed with it.  The monitor control buttons being in the back where you have to blindly feel for them and just remember which one is which is a terrible design.  All of my other monitors have the buttons under the front edge where they are so much easier to use.  Having two HDMI inputs is nice, but the actual steps to switch between inputs are cumbersome, and the speed to switch screens is slow.  Not a big deal for the occasional change, but if you want to switch between inputs frequently while sitting at your desk, this is not a good monitor.The worst thing MAY be the speakers  - they are absolute garbage in both sound quality and volume (but see the last paragraph about the screen flashing on and off).  Turning up the volume in system settings on the monitor does absolutely nothing to increase the sound at any setting above 50%.  What you can hear sounds like a 20-year old laptop sitting on the floor of a school bathroom - tiny, echo-y, and very hard to understand.  I have several other monitors with built-in speakers, and these are by far the worst I have every heard.  The other monitor sitting next to this one sounds absolutely fantastic by comparison.  I have good speakers on my desk, but I was hoping to get rid of them to save some space - no way with this monitor!The picture quality seems decent - sitting side-by-side with a much older HP monitor of the same size and definition, both displays seem similar in brightness and color accuracy on an average browser window, but when comparing a screen with lots of high-contrast dark and light, this monitor is very washed out.  I have tried adjusting picture and color settings, and nothing improves the lack of a good black and poor contrast.  In fact, increasing the contrast setting just makes the blacks even MORE gray!But I am quite worried about the reliability.I set this up yesterday and left it on with the laptop in sleep mode all night - I didn't make any setting adjustments.  This morning the laptop woke fine and the monitor came on as expected, but as soon as I reached around the side of the monitor to find the control buttons, the monitor started flashing on and off, like a light with a loose or broken wire.  When I pulled my hand back, it was fine, but I could not touch the monitor at all without it flashing on and off.  The power light was not going on and off, so it was not that, and I tried changing the input to both HDMI ports with no difference.  Once I opened up the OSD, the flashing stopped as long as the OSD was up, but started again when I hit the Exit button.  After about 15 minutes of playing with the settings, I noticed that the monitor was no longer showing the problems when I touched it.  And it seems to still be working normally about an hour later.  But I am extremely worried about what was causing this issue, and how long it will be before it starts again.  If I wiggle the HDMI cable on the back of the monitor, it sometimes blanks out (but no where near as touchy  as it was in the beginning), so I guess the fault is there and I will have to return the unit.  What a pain.",36 people found this helpful

Great buy specially for gaming!,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on March 24, 2018","Style: 24"" 75Hz | Pattern: Monitor",True,"I have a GTX 1060 laptop, set up is easy and there was no need for me to calibrate anything, I even dare say this monitor looks better than my own laptop screen at 1080p.At first i thought it didn not support 75Hz and the colors were washed out and it was too bright, also on the nvidia panel it said 1080p at 60Hz however this is what you gotta do to fix it.""CALIBRATION""1. Connect via HDMI2. Open Display settings and make sure that they are set so that only the 2nd display is turned on, do not put duplicate or extend.3. Open Nvidia control panel and go to ""Change Resolution""4. You will see two lists, one will say HD, UHD etc, the other one at the bottom will say ""PC"", (changing the first list will project your laptop screen to the second screen however your laptop is 60Hz and the monitor is 75Hz that is why its limited to 60Hz and colors are washed out, changing the second list will basically use your laptop to power up the monitor at full 75Hz 1080p with the right color calibration.)5. On list two ""PC"" change the resolution to 1080p and 75HzAnd there you go, now you can use your 75Hz monitor for gaming, make sure to change the settings indvidually in games to 75Hz or they will still run at 60Hz and the colors will be washed out.Now onto the review*** REVIEW ***The screen resolution is full 1920x1080p at 75Hz, the colors are very accurate, it looks no where near like a TN panel, I would say its in between a TN panel and an IPS panel but closer to IPS.It comes with speakers which are ok for the price but I recommend headphones or your own speakers which are probably better if you got this for gaming.This is what comes in the package- Monitor- 4 screws for mounting- Two screws for setting up the monitor (non adjustable height(- HDMI to VGA cable- VGA to VGA cableI really recommend this monitor even if not for gaming, its a great price for what you get and it even comes with two cables.However one thing to note is that the difference between 60Hz and 75Hz is hard to notice in games. Playing Witcher 3 and Rise of Tomb Raider at locked in 75FPS wasn't anything much more amazing than 60FPS. However it is still an improvement.One last thing to confider if you’re debating on a 75Hz vs 144Hz monitor- If you have a graphics card such as the GTX 770,970,1060 Most games (witcher, call of duty, battlefield wont go back 80 fps on ultra / high graphics) so you wont be able to take advantage of a 144Hz monitor, so I suggest this one. UNLESS you play on medium/low settings.- If you have a graphics card such as a GTX 770,780,980,1070 and above, I suggest the 144Hz monitor since these can run most tiles at well above 100FPS so you can take advantage of the monitor.*** UPDATE ***Earlier on the review I said the difference between 60Hz and 75Hz was negligible, I take it back.I played on my laptop which is limited to 60Hz and it feels bad and slugish compared to 75Hz, once you go higher refresh rate you can never go backIts one of those things you dont realise until its taken away, great improvement.",899 people found this helpful

I've had these 2 monitors for close on a year now, wanted to wait to write my review to make sure they worked well. With these two monitors added to my setup, it's much easy to multitask and use two separate systems once. I use one for playing console games and the other for PC use like video editing.  The resolution is great, allowing me to read small text/chat boxes in my MMORPG games without pixels making the text distorted. Refresh rates is on point and even when using Live View on Capture software there's no lag on the screen!  The side buttons are easily navigated once you know what button does what and having 3 (two HDMI, 1 VGA) video inputs means you can change sources if you need to without much trouble. The bezel around the monitors are low profile enough that the screens don't seem overly large without giving you plenty of viewing surface.  The biggest downside for me is that the speakers for these monitors are in the back of the monitor near the bottom and are incredibly weak! At 100, the volume is still so low I can't hear very well, so I'm forced to use headphones which starts to fatigue the head and ears after several hours of editing. The monitors do come with audio jacks in the back, but I feel that speaker quality shouldn't force us to default to external speakers/headphones.  If you don't mind wearing headphones, or play games with headphones for Party Chat/game audio it's not a deal breaker, and as I said I mostly edit videos/ play games on these so headphones are part of the whole deal, it'd just be nice to not be forced into headsets when I don't want to.  Other than that ONE issue, these are great monitors and considering the price (especially if you're getting more than one at once like I did) I'm more than happy to deal with headphones. Highly recommend with cautionary information about built in speakers.",5 people found this helpful

The base is all plastic and carries no weight like your normal and high-end monitors. The ports are facing straight back rather than pointing down, which puts strain on the cable and ports. The power cable is rather flimsy and thin, I'm afraid the interior wire will break after repeated connect and disconnect.

My office has much larger ones and thought this was a sign I should finally upgrade and get the same screen size at home as I do in the office.  But since my old monitors lasted a LONG time without paying a lot, I wanted to repeat that experience.  Lots of research and talking to other people led me to similar conclusion:  not a lot out there at a cheap price for larger sizes for people that just need a large working screen and not concerned about graphics and gaming.I had not heard of the Scepter brand before so I was a bit dubious.  But as I talked about my search with others, some programmers mentioned they HAD heard of them and were reputable.  They were about the best price and reviews largely good, so the programmer endorsement was what I needed to pull the trigger.I'm very happy with these monitors!  Easy to set up.  Great resolution and color.  SO MUCH LIGHTER than my old ones.  I had to adjust the tension in my mounting arms accordingly.  I went with the standard, automatice calibration and haven't felt the need to fiddle with additional settings.  I'm an account/project manager that deals in spreadsheets, project management tools, Microsoft suite (Excel, Work, Outlook), and Adobe Creative Suite (Acrobat, Dreamweaver, Photoshop), and other custom tools for digital design, programming and management.One thing I liked, and needed, is that the mounting screwholes on the back of the monitors are on the BOTTOM of the screen...rather than the middle or towards the top, which seems to be more standard.  This actually helped me get the monitors to the height I wanted with the mount I have without haveing to replace that too.

I was thinking that the monitor was defective when I saw it, but, after some homework, figured out that the problem is caused by faulty ""overdrive"" feature (or maybe not faulty?  never actually saw this feature before).  The control for ""Overdrive"" is under ""System"" and it's set to ""medium"" by default.  Turn it off.  Then the problem of blurry screen will go away and after that, the monitor is great.  (While I can't speak to the durability of this particular product, I've had generally excellent experience with Scepter monitors, all of which (I've had 4, including this one) were very durable over 3-4 years that I've used them.  At minimum, they products are worth it, IMHO.*Original review below:The short version is that the monitor is great (it is, fwiw, the most economical FHD monitor available), but some of the features don't seem to be working quite right.  One specific problem that came out right away was that the ""Overdrive"" feature is not working properly:  when you hook it up to your computer, you will find that objects on the monitor get blurry momentarily when you scroll.  After some searching, I found out that this is due to the overdrive feature that's supposed to speed up the response time...except, in this case, it's just making objects blurrier as they move with the mouse scroll.  The overdrive is set to ""medium"" in the factory setting.  You want to turn it off as the first thing you do.  After that, you should be happy.",24 people found this helpful

It's not a terrible monitor for what you paid for. In some ways it's better than the LG in some ways, brighter whites and slightly more saturated darks. One issue I have with it is that I can't get the 75Hz refresh rate that is on the box and in the manual. Another issue I have is that it's not as crisp as the LG, when watching videos the image is slightly more crisp and cooler as far as color. Overall this monitor is a great beginner monitor if you buy it at the $90 that I did, just make sure that if you are running a dual monitor setup that you have a stand that let's you adjust the height of the monitors individually because the VESA mount is low on the monitor and that most likely will put it at a higher viewing angle than your other monitor... trust me I know.",

However, upon assembling the monitor to the neck and base, I'm finding that it tilts slightly forward (pointing the display at a downward angle). Tried taking the neck off again to see if I could adjust the angle, since the product description says it should be able to tilt in a range of +5 to -15 degrees. Could not manage to make the monitor tilt backward.Even with all the other features—hdmi and VGA ports, audio features, etc—if I can't adjust the angle for basic ergonomic purposes, this can't be my monitor. Likely going to return, unless the seller can manage to resolve this issue.EDIT: So I tried to change the tilt again, this time using the neck to ""wrench"" the metal joint. It made me nervous the whole time, since it felt like I was potentially applying excessive force and about to make something snap. But the angle did change.

I gave away the 4 in NJ, prior to moving to FL.  Thinking that I still had 4 in FL, I gave 1 of those to my brother for his security system.  Upon arrival, I realized I only originally had 2 in FL and now I was left with 1.  I struggled with 1 monitor for 4 months.  I wouldn't purchase another because the pandemic supply and demand had pushed prices too high for my retirement income and I wanted the monitors to match.  I happen to see this one at a discount which brought it into my budget range so I jumped on it.  It isn't much more than my 2018 purchases however, the last few I bought for FL all have built-in speakers and 2 HDMI ports.  Whaaaat?  So very much worth the price and I highly recommend this monitor.  The pictures are wonderful.  Can't comment on sound since I just found out that they have speakers and haven't used those yet.

Black levels are poor, picture quality is acceptable and backlighting is shockingly very even. The led backlighting either isn't zoned or at least doesn't strike me as zoned (I don't remember whether or not this was advertised as zoned but I suspect it wasn't). With all that said, I didn't expect these to be amazing monitors. As general purpose 24"" budget displays these are pretty good. I haven't used them to game so I can't attest to the sync on the 75hz mode.I purchased these for a home office setup where I'm looking at emails, spreadsheets, command shells and web browsers all day peppered with the odd VTC call. These do those tasks admirably. I'm sitting 34-44 inches away from these screens 10-12 hours a day and my eyes haven't started to feel any strain so that's a plus.Build quality on one of them is displaying (ha pun not intended) a bit of bezel separation. I only noticed this about 2 weeks into ownership but it isn't enough for me to go through the hassle of unmounting it from my monitor arm and swapping it out if an RMA were approved, but it is enough for me to drop a star.I will also note that there is no real re-enforcement to this chasis. When mounted to an adjustable monitor arm I would recommend only rotating,swinging or pivoting by grabbing opposing bezel corners rather than opposing bezel edge as otherwise you will introduce a bit of flex.  This is something I always check when mounting new monitors for the first time and holy heck did these not even pass my minimum comfort zone for rigidity on even the lightest adjustment when going by the edges - corners only for sure.Other than the bezel separation these panels hit my expectations for a inexpensive general purpose 24"" displays with dual HDMI inputs. I haven't performed any calibration on these displays so my ""acceptable"" rating on their picture quality could potentially be improved upon and I've used preconfigured picture settings.",

I could actually fit a larger monitor in the space available, but it seems like they all have several inches of space between the bottom of the monitor and the stand it's mounted on and are not adjustable. Previously, I actually cut/modified a stand in order to fit a larger monitor in this space. Unfortunately the Sceptre monitor doesn't have an adjustable stand, but at least it has less useless area between the bottom of the monitor and bottom of the stand!I've only been using for about a month now but for a smaller low cost monitor the picture quality is quite good. At least I think so. Should mention that I'm using this for running older PC games (Age of Empires, Sims 3, GTR2, etc.), word processing, working with photos, etc. Driving sims like GTR2 and GT Legends might push the graphics limits but I'm not on You Tube streaming movies or online w/IRacing.I have an older set of speakers (from the friggin' 1980's that not only still work but work very well - Logitech makes/made some awesome stuff!) so no idea how good the monitor's internals work but should be nice to have them as a backup.Overall it appears to be perfect for my needs but YMMV.

The chargers get somewhat warmer to the touch, but not hot, yet,  after a couple of days of use. It makes me wonder if this is going to fail over time,  as these types of charger setups usually do - or if and when they will get warmer  to the touch, etc. The cords leading up from the plug in wall 'charger/pack' is small as well- I am not an engineer but it appears that they are as minimal as possible and are running the converted power ( D.C.?)  to the back of the monitor, which is also causing me some concern.  They are not what I consider heavy duty by any means- more along the lines of a cellphone cord strength,  running from the wall to the back of the monitors. I assume this is a design so they can change the chargers out for different country power systems. etc.At the end of the day- I will keep the monitors but will touch the packs from time to time. Hopefully the wires do not move much as I would fear a short circuit that you get with a cell phone cord with a lot of use.Buyers will need to keep the boxes as it says specifically states on the boxes that they are needed for any warranty returns, etc.BTW - it did come with a generic HDMI cord, a small set up manual, 4 screws and 4 extension screws for mounting options; the screws are minimal as well...",One person found this helpful

Out of the box, I noticed that its pretty light, frame is minimal and pretty thin. Has multiple mounting options with the stand, or the standard bolt pattern on the back for use with a desk mount.  Included one HDMI cable.  Was pretty much plug and play.  I opted to adjust the RBG values slightly to match the hue of my somewhat older monitors (I use a triple display option for work).I like that it has two HDMI inputs. I have my work computer and my personal computer for gaming hooked up to both HDMI ports and can switch the input as necessary.  It does auto-detect the input connection; if both machines are off and you power one on, it will switch to that input automatically, which is a pretty common, but very nice feature.  I do with the button were placed in a slightly more accessible place.  Currently, this monitor is in the middle of the 3 that I use.  If I do need to press the buttons, they're on the back and I have to move them around; it would be helpful if they were top or bottom mounted, but I suppose that would cause the screen to be thicker to accommodate buttons on the narrow side of the frame.  So not a huge complaint, just a wish-list item.Picture quality is sharp, has pretty good contrast.  I have the 24"" size and the native resolution defaults to 1920 x 1080.  Pretty good blacks.  Pretty good color presets.Overall, I have no major complaints at this point.  Its a good size for a home-use, office display and at $100, was a pretty good deal.

For under $120 this monitor well surpassed my expectations initially, as for longevity, we'll see. Great picture quality, thin appearance, and pretty small bezels. Came with HDMI cord (wasn't expecting that) and spacers for wall mounts/other mounting kits. Usable UI for adjustments if that's your thing. I honestly just set it up, plugged it in and bobs you're uncle. Again, it was only $104 when I ordered it, so this review is based on that. What else can be said? 24 inches is 24 inches, 75 hertz is 75 hertz, colors are colored and cords do cord things! For the price, it's definitely recommended and expectations where exceeded. Don't buy a monitor under $120 and try to review it like a $500 god-like gaming accessory.So to recap, the monitor monitors, cords cord, and the stand stands. Cough into you elbow, stop driving 100mph and don't go to Walmart just to browse the electronics during a pandemic.Update- Jan 2021-turns out that you shouldn't sit near anything valuable while in vr. Still worked great even after I had smacked/punched it accidentally in vr......well at least the first 8 or 9 times anyway. The last hit did it in for good unfortunately but clearly not at all any fault of the brand.

Easily configurable to a myriad of needs.That said, it is a TOTAL PAIN to mount.Now, if you want to simply use the included pedestal base, fine. No problem, the installation is fairly simple and straightforward.The REAL problem comes when you want to use the VESA mount. I suppose if you intend to use a variable frame wall mount, it should go well. It's mounting on a swing arm bracket that proved difficult. If you do not have 1/2"" spacers and long mounting screws, you will have to take more drastic measures to make the mounting plate fit properly. I need about 30 minutes, a Dremel-style power tool and a metal-cutting wheel to cut the pedestal mount bracket off, then, using a metal-grinding bit to smooth out the rough bits. If you do this carefully, it will go quickly and cleanly. You just have to be careful and TAKE YOUR TIME.Once I was able to mount mine, it worked beautifully from the minute I turned it on. It has a line of buttons up the right-hand rear, with the power button on the bottom.I have this connected to an Acer Nitro 5 17"" tablet with dedicated nVidia GTX1650 4GB video card, so I can us my laptop with a wireless mouse and keyboard without squinting at a typical laptop display.

I work in an IDE (i.e. fancy programming text editor) that uses a dark theme, so the backlight bleeding is very noticeable with the dark background- Washed out colors. Just general lack of vibrancy in the colors and muted overall- Color accuracy? visually, based on how washed out the colors are; I'm going to wager the color accuracy is not good. NOTE: I haven't measured, but let's be real here.- Speakers. It has builtin speakers. They work. That's about the best compliment I can give them. Use headphones.Overall Opinion--------------------I personally got this monitor for my home office. I work as a software engineer and work from home frequently. This is my second monitor, alongside my 5+ year old 900p Gateway TFT LCD monitor.First off, my old monitor performs better in all the above mentioned short comings. Vibrant color and no visible backlight bleeding. I don't know how much the gateway monitor cost originally, as I got it from an old neighbor who was moving out :)So, even compared to monitors of years gone by, this thing is underwhelming.That all said, for productivity use, I can't complain that much. The muted nature actually seems to reduce eye strain perhaps. As we say in the software world, ""It's not a bug, it's a feature!"". The backlight bleed, while annoying, is easily forgotten once I'm actually focused working on something. Color accuracy and vibrancy doesn't matter to me. My general use case is: programming, IM, email, documentation writing/reading, web browsing, and general productivity usage.Conclusion-------------At the end of the day, it's a 24"" 1080p monitor for just shy of $100. If you're planning on using it for gaming, photo/video editing, general media consumption, or anything in that area; I'd suggest spending a bit more for a better monitor.On the other hand, if you just want something for general office/productivity usage. I mean, it's under $100 and it works. So I'd definitely recommend it for that use case.",4 people found this helpful

"Sceptre 24"" Professional Thin 75Hz 1080p LED Monitor 2x HDMI VGA Build-in Speakers, Machine Black (E248W-19203R Series)",3.0,All around decent with a few shortcomings,"Reviewed in the United States on April 8, 2020","Style: 24"" 75Hz | Pattern: Monitor",True,"I bought this monitor mainly for the attractive low price, like most Sceptre monitors. I wasn’t too fussed about the refresh rate of this monitor since this is a second monitor that isn’t used for gaming, mainly work/productivity. Looking at the pictures from Amazon I didn’t realize the low placement for the vesa mount, so it wouldn’t line up with my other monitor (Asus VG248qe) horizontally, so I decided to use the monitor in portrait mode being it was for work not gaming. My initial impressions were decent, colors were a bit washed out and undersaturated, but with some adjustments of the color settings the monitor looked decent and gets the job done considering what you pay for itA couple things to note:1. Not ideal for horizontal dual monitor setups with different monitors. Unless you check the VESA mount position on the other monitor or use one of the monitors in portrait mode, the monitors will be slightly askew2. Not ideal for gaming, unless you play casually every now and then and don’t care too much about frames or picture quality, mainly due to the reason of the low refresh rate, pity full colors, especially noticeable in deep blacks or darker colors, and whites which have a blue tone to them, and although it is a 1080p monitor it’s true resolution is questionable it has sort of a hazy grain no matter what I try and do to fix it.3. Because of the lack of a display port and the odd refresh rate cap you have to make sure you buy the right cable as VGA doesn’t have the ability to surpass 60hz and only certain HDMI cables can reach past 60hz so make sure you buy the right one.Summary: it’s an all around decent monitor, although I personally wouldn’t use it to game, it still has the potential to be decent in game. With this monitor you truly get what you pay for, if you plan on getting into gaming more seriously I say take the investment of getting a higher end monitor if possible as it’s 100% worth it, otherwise go for it",3 people found this helpful

I'm using this on a boat running navigation  software on a Raspberry Pi 4. For that purpose, it should work well. Screen has good clarity and does get rather bright when set. Including standoffs for vesa mounts to clear the stand mount is a nice addition. The speakers are a joke for anything but a very quiet home-desk where you're sitting less than 5' from it. They aren't very full sounding, and even at max volume they get drowned out by any background noise. Luckily having an audio out jack helps with this. The only other thing I would've liked to see though would be a remote to adjust the settings instead of having to reach around to the back. Until you have a feel for them, or keep the manual handy, you have to fumble a little to get through the menu. Even just a basic menu-up-down-enter remote would've been good.For the price, it's a decent 1080 monitor, very lightweight, and multiple inputs is great. If you want to use it for more than a monitor, add a cheap set of speakers and it'll do better. If you get a good sale on it, it just makes it better.",

These are easy to view, no real latency (studdering pictures), we watch HDMI videos on them, under WIN10 and ZORIN (unix like OS), both of them perform very nicely.Low Power consumption!Why these - because they will run off a 12v battery.

Tune it using your computer instead.3) Minor complaint, the frame of the monitor is plastic.

I reached out to customer support via phone, we went through the troubleshooting process and confirmed it was a defective monitor and to email for a warranty claim.Once I emailed they made me go through the exact same process, and actually tried to suggest I installed the monitor incorrectly at first. After several emails, they finally said they’d replace the monitor.Their warranty replacement is different than most vendors. They require you to send their device back first. It took about two weeks for them to send me a box to ship the clearly broken monitor back. The first box they sent me was apparently lost by fedex, which just caused additional delays.I had to ask them three separate times to provide the return label. Why didn’t they just provide that in the box they sent me? Who knows.Once they finally received the monitor, I had to follow up with them AGAIN to ship out the new monitor.FedEx delivered the monitor to the wrong address. The support team currently is not providing any updates or resolutions to the issue.It’s been about two months since their monitor stopped working, and I still have no resolution. While I understand part of the challenge was with fedex, they’re the ones who chose to use them, and they are the ones who need to fix this.The experience with the support staff has been awful. They are slow to respond and make you jump through hoops to get anything done. I bought two monitors, one was faulty. So a 50% failure rate from my experience and terrible customer support.

Went with this because it was the best value in terms of size vs price. I'd also purchased these for clients in the past and heard they were happy with them. After seeing the complaints about the colors being washed out, I gave my monitors away and decided if there were any problems with these I'd either live with it or fix it.Out of the box the monitors were fine. The only complaint I can come up with is that the VESA mounts are lower on the back due to the slim design. After looking at settings, I determined that for me as an IT manager I didn't need to recalibrate the screens at all. Granted, I spend most of my time looking at text documents, configuration pages for network equipment, and the accounting software my company uses. I couldn't speak to color calibration for individuals doing video or photo production.One thought on the others experiencing washed out colors - HDMI out on a computer kind of expects a TV. Televisions and Monitors will sometimes have different ranges for black levels, which can cause the screen to look washed out. If you're experiencing this, check the control panel for your graphics driver. You should be able to adjust black levels and fix the issue. This has been a driving factor in my preference for just about anything over HDMI. (Display Port is king, for what it's worth.)",484 people found this helpful

I work from home, am in college online, and play some PC games. What I used to do (and was hoping to continue doing) was keep my work laptop connected to the two monitors during the work day, then just switch my work laptop with my personal one and continue using them for school/games.However, ANY kind of disconnection makes it an extreme hassle to get these set back up. I mean any. I disconnected the HDMI cord from my work laptop the first day, and it took 2 hours (of constantly restarting and reconnecting) to get the displays set back up again. I resolved to just use these for work, but I genuinely may have to return them. Even when I just turn off my laptop at night - every morning when I go to turn it all back on at least one of them will not connect (picture is from this morning, just turning my laptop on. This has happened every morning since I’ve gotten these monitors.) and it wouldn’t be as big of a deal if it was just as easy as disconnecting and reconnecting the hdmi cords to reset the displays. But it’s not. I have to restart my computer with the monitors disconnected and powered off, then when my laptop restarts I have to take it off its port and reconnect that, then turn power the monitors on, then connect the hdmi cables. And it takes at least 3-4 times of doing it in that exact order before the monitors finally register that they’re connected and extend my laptop display. That’s an hour every morning just tinkering with a monitor. Which sucks because I spent so much time mounting these things.I’ve never had this issue with any monitors I’ve had in the past. I’m not sure what causes the disruption. I even tried replacing the HDMI cables thinking that may be the cause. But spending an hour each morning restarting my computer to try and get the monitor to register that it is, in fact, connected makes the picture resolution/other perks null and void in my opinion. If you can keep your main monitor/computer constantly turned on then maybe these are good monitors for you. Otherwise I’d suggest another monitor.",One person found this helpful

Plugged one into docking stations with VGA, the other with HDMI cable - both connected flawlessly and went right to the correct signal.  They also were correctly detected by Windows and setup automatically to 1920x1080 resolution.As these are being used for IT work, not really pushing the gaming capabilities, but the text and images are displayed very crisply.  Brightness seems just as good as my ASUS gaming monitor that cost over $50 more.  So the value is definitely there.Want to give kudos to Amazon Customer Service.  When ordered they were on back order - expected to get restocked on 3/28, but monitors showed up on the 27th - though smashed.  Contacted Customer Support right away and they issues return shipping and ordered replacements.

I bought one for my wife and it is still working great. I actually had monitor envy, so I bought two for me (dual screen worker).Approximately 70% of Amazon review for this product are fabulous while 30% had various issues...my second experience with these monitors places me firmly into the latter category.Similar to the reviews I read, the screen would go black or would not connect at all to either HDMI port. The two new SCEPTRE monitors had bad HDMI ports: Monitor A had 1 of 2 ports that worked and Monitor B had no working ports. To be fair...1. I tested both new monitors on 3 different laptops (2 Mac, 1 PC) all of which worked 100% with the existing old monitors - these were supposed to be simple monitor upgrades.2. Used 4 different HDMI cables (2 provided with the monitors and 2 currently in use with my current monitors).3. I also tried 2 HDMI to Mini Display cables as well as 2 different adapters - all of which work with other external monitors.4. The one port that did work was loose and if the cable shifted or accidentally got knocked, the monitor would go out.I did reach out directly to SCEPTRE and they were kind, nice, and responded promptly. This was an Amazon purchase so the return was quick and easy.All in all, I do believe this is a good product and a great value. I hope you are in the lucky 70% category. I also hope for SCEPTRE this issue is quickly resolved.",10 people found this helpful

The IPS panel looks great and is very thin. The instruction manual says that it is a 14ms gray to gray response time. I played Rocket League on it and it ran smooth, I did not have any problems with the response time. The frame is thin but not that much. The audio in and out is a blessing if you want to connect your speakers to it while having more than one monitors, it helps with cable management.  Having two HDMI on the back is great, I would have prefered a DVI instead of the RGB but that's a bit of nitpicking.The monitor does have some bad design choices though. Like someone else said, the AC adapter is bulky and takes a lot of space. I look forward to getting two more in the future to mount them in a VESA mount but I will have to get a multi outlet with enough space for all of the AC adapters. Another thing is that the buttons are on the back. If they could at least put the power button on the front, it would help a great deal. The on-screen display is ok. It gets the job done but since the buttons are on the back, you have to remember where the buttons that navigate the menus are. You need to remember which one is back and which one is accept. A simple label on the OSC reminding you of their order would have helped.I would have given this monitor a 4.5 out of 5 stars but I had to round the score.

Presets for color but you can also dive in and adjust to your taste if you're trying to really dial it in. Me? Nah, the ""Cool"" setting is doing just fine here. No controls for sound.Sound: That's a ""no"" for me, dawg. 4 stars (not 5) because the speakers are so shot. Super hollow and tinny sounding. Plugging in headphones? Go straight into your macbook because even plugging beats into this screens sounds like tin trash cans.Random note: I feel like it needs a minute to dial itself in each time I use it. As if it's like ""hold up, we starting? ok cool, but let me stretch real quick."" Then it feels like it's real on point.Yeah, it's bangin. For $90, get after it.UPDATE: I now have my xbox one in the second HDMI port. Works perfect. Had to adjust the screen color/settings a bit to get it to flow smoother and get all snug. Now we up here.

I spent a significant amount of money on curved MSI 32"" 1440p displays as the primary gaming monitors but wanted something smaller and less expensive for the secondary monitors for displaying YouTube videos, Netflix, web pages, etc.After receiving the monitors and using them for a week I have to say I'm really quite pleasantly surprised with both the image on the displays as well as the fit and finish of them. Right out of the box I was pleasantly surprised with the very good packaging and the light weight and thinness of the displays themselves; I've found no dead or stuck pixels so far.Additionally, as you can see, I needed them VESA mounted and when I initially saw the back of them I moaned because they have a mounting stud sticking out of the VESA area for their stands. But a few seconds later I realized that lo-and-behold Sceptre had included standoffs and hardware necessary to accomplish a VESA mount! They even included a small screwdriver! They could have cheaped out on including that hardware (my expensive MSI curved displays did and are not VESA mountable out of the box) but these little guys didn't. Good show, Sceptre.I haven't used the stands so I cannot comment on those, but text is clear, color is good and the built-in menus are simple and effective. I have to say, for a monitor at this price-point I'm pretty impressed.",32 people found this helpful

I put this monitor head to head with my AUZAI 24 inch 1080p monitor and the Auzai though only 1080p put it to shame. The picture quality on this monitor is not very good at all. The speakers are a complete waste and the headphone jack barely sends any signal at all. The dual hdmi inputs are nice but the placement on the monitor makes it difficult to mount and really requires a 90° adapter. In standby mode the screen stays back-lit lighting your room at night if on.In short even for such a great price this monitor is barely worth it. The Auzai was a far better deal at around the same cost even though it only has 1 hdmi no speaker or headphone jack and is supposedly lower resolution.

Convinced him I had so sent to web site to fill out an RMA request that needed to be sent in along with the pictures I took of the monitor. Told me the RMA would take 3 to 4 days to get processed and approved. Then have to ship it back on our dime and it would take about 3 weeks to fix it. In the mean time my boss has to use some other monitor.Most companies I deal with replace defective equipment and send a return shipping label for the old part. If you don't ship it back you get charged for it. But this company thinks it's OK to make you return their defective product on your dime and leave you without equipment for a month while they decide if they will fix it.Well they finally decided it was the monitor and not the PC or cables and had me send it in to be repaired. They did send me a box to return it in and did pay for shipping both ways. However after several weeks and getting the monitor back,I put is on a brand new PC and tried it with both a VGA cable and an HDMI cable and it is doing the same thing I sent it in for. When windows puts the monitor to sleep, when it powers back up it is unusable as the picture shows.Right now waiting to see what they are going to do.Got an email this morning asking me to try a few things. It still isn't right. Some companies don't know when to cut their losses. They have probably spent more on shipping, repairs and time then it's worth not to mention customer satisfaction and goodwill.",14 people found this helpful

Once I got used to it, it looks totally fine and I don't have refresh rate problems (though I don't play any heavily frame-reliant games, mostly just Dead by Daylight and simple indie games).

Especially-nice is the wall-wart DC power supply - I've always had heavier 3prong power cables going to monitors, and on a 3x stand they can be rather bulky and tough to hide - these, instead, are very thin wires for power, which were very easy to hide. Hypothetically, if the wall-wart ever fails, it ought to be easy to replace, rather than chucking the screen for a bad supply.Also like the dual-HDMI for future flexibility.As other reviews have mentioned, the sound is acceptable for the ""oops I forgot to switch to my receiver output"" sound, rather than having no sound at all, and definitely would be sufficient for office computers rather than having desktop speakers for email sounds.Would definitely recommend these to anyone looking for a simple screen solution.",One person found this helpful

I write this while using a ASUS monitor that is over a decade old still going strong, just a slightly fading backlight.The black bars began whenever the monitor was shut down for a long period of time, and would take a good 30m-1hr to clean itself of them, so I began keeping the monitor on indefinitely - and now the bars after a month of that fix are spawning on their own volition.

It is fuzzy and looks blurry when it comes to projects or photos. If you are using it browse the internet then fine it is cheap and you have more space but the colors and quality are NOT for photos, editing or anything along those lines including audio timelines as will make you life even more difficult. Now if you use it as a place to move documents etc so you do not have to expose all the time on a hot key to find something then great and that is now my purpose. I keep my social media, emails, music and i messages on this screen so the 85 I spent is worth it.

I bout 2 back in 2018 and a third in 2020. The first two I bought have been amazing and where a step up from what I had previously. In 2020 I decided to get a third one, having purchased a new GPU. The third one, was not as high quality as the other two in picture. The colors don't pop the way the other two do. I thought this was a setting issue and configured the third to match the other two in at least color. Unfortunately that did not work. It seems that the newest monitor has just more blue in it than it's older counter parts and it drives me nuts. I've tried everything I canthink of to match the colors going as far as to only use DP to HDMI cables but nothing works. If you have purchased these in the past and want to get more to match what you have be aware this might be an issue.",

Picture quality is great, even though I have an excellent video card. Sound without my headset connected to my tower is a tad low and disorienting (even with the volumeat 100%, but with any speaker that issue could be fixed.

If you don't know much about gaming or monitors, ghosting is when the pixels on the monitor cannot change color quick enough to keep up with what the PC/Console is doing.In short, when playing games, you will notice pixels (black pixels especially) create a blurring effect along your screen. This can be partially fixed by using the Monitor's 'Overdrive' function, but it still remains either way.Aside from the ghosting, the monitor is very good.A fair warning, however, is to make sure you look at your PC/Console.

The only downside to this monitor is longevity, I am writing this review about a week before a year of use with this monitor. I use this monitor heavily, practically every day, numerous hours of the day (bc I have no life lol), so that should be also factored into this.The one negative thing I can say is that the pixels tend to ""linger?"" a little after I've used it for so long (Kinda hard to explain but basically, if you have a black circle flying across a white background, this circle will be more like a bunch of overlapping circles flying across the background, not sure the cause of it, but it can sometimes make certain games have a slight additional motion blur that is mostly noticeable on high contrasting pictures.) Doesn't make the monitor unusable, but something to take note of, may be worse in another year. Does 75 hrtz, 1080 p no issues with that, sweet spot in terms of size as well for 1080 pWould I recommend it? If you can spend the extra money, buy something a little better for longevity, if that's what you're going for. On a budget? then this is an okay option.",2 people found this helpful

They are quite light which is nice.However, two of my three units have dead pixels, and I'm debating returning them all and getting a different brand, since I'm not confident they're being tested adequately before being boxed up, and I don't want to go back and forth ten times to get units without flaws.

Almost looks like a Low End 2016 Samsung picture when dialed in right. However! Do not use the HDMI cable it comes with. It looks super high quality and everything but I'm willing to bet the bad reviews in the 1 star section is due to the HDMI cable. After 10 hours of use the screen flickered and got no signal on everything I tested. I realized it was the cable because I used the same setup with a different monitor I had with me. I changed the HDMI and viola! Wonder how many people returned this poor monitor over a bad HDMI cable.,

When I went to Fedex the label didn't cover the full cost of return, so I had to pay an extra $20 (Yes, 20 with a zero!) just to ship the product back to the seller. 5 days after it was delivered (with Fedex proof of delivery), seller still said they couldn't issue my refund because they ""can't scan the item back"".

Plugged the new hub in, same issue. At this point I began to suspect the monitors but how could 2 be bad?! Plugged computer into my TV and it immediately extended the desktop. At this point I went back and checked out the monitors. I was using the supplied HDMI cables. There is a plastic bezel around each input that extends out about 1/8 inch. The plastic around the HDMI input pushes up against the plastic bezle and makes it so that the HDMI cable is not fully inserted into the monitor. I pushed it in hard and the monitor turned on. I then had to literally break and Dremel around the HDMI plug in the monitor to create clearance for the plug. This level of stupidity by the manufacturer is incredible.  I would like 4 hours of my life back please. 🤦‍♂️",7 people found this helpful

It's working great so far and I've found no reason to be concerned about its durability and continuing quality.  As good as anything else you'd find in this price range.",

The connections to the PC are good. I was afraid of getting this brand but after reading many reviews and pull the trigger and wasn't let down.",

The outer packaging advertises the item inside and is held closed with clear shipping tape.

Once opened the product is tightly packaged in a Styrofoam shell with a static cling screen protector.  It comes with screws to mount on the stand, mount on a wall mount and even a magnetized Phillips screwdriver (that was a major plus for me bc I can always use a new screwdriver) as well as an HDMI cable and power adapter.  The size of the 24"" monitor is very nice, with barely 1/2 inch trim around the screen.  I work from home using a laptop, so I was very excited to work with the monitor but when I plugged it into the power strip...nothing.  I plugged into the wall...nothing.  I plugged it into another outlet on a different wall...nothing.  I took it to the bathroom and plugged it in...nothing.  Kitchen - nothing. Living room - nothing.  I contacted their customer service via email that very night.  They replied within 24 hours, asking me to register the item and provide them with the model and serial number.

Since the screen was on the cheaper side, had VESA mounts, supported HDMI at 75Hz/1080P, and came with great reviews I figured it was a great deal. Out of the box the quality looked decent and came with everything needed including tools for assembly.I was soon disappointed when I connected it to my laptop. Initially I noticed that the screen was over scanning (the images extended beyond the edge of the screen). The desktop extended past preventing the use of several windows features, and programs would span both screens when clicking the maximize button. Secondly the text with many applications, including Microsoft Office suite was very blurry. I expected some blurriness since this is not an IPS screen, but this was bad.I tried messing with video card settings, using different video cards (laptop has two), using Windows screen calibration and ClearText tuning and different video cables - no improvement. The monitor settings are very limited so they provide no help.Ultimately I ended up returning after Amazon Support was unable to diagnose the problem.  If you're looking for a cheap screen and don't care about image quality then this is a good deal. If you care somewhat about image quality or  have a hard time reading computer screens - do yourself a favor and spend a little extra on a decent screen.",8 people found this helpful

If I fired it up, the screen Sceptre would turn red but it wouldn't start up. It would sometimes say that my USB wasn't plugged in. I tried both of the 2 ports but neither one worked.

It has tons of other issues and they became apparent after the return period. It flashes between a yellow and blue pall. Sometimes it goes black except I can still see the cursor, but I have to turn it off an on for it to work. Also, I don't love the yellow cast when it's in the eye saver mode, but maybe that's just how it is. What drives me crazy most about this monitor is how hard it is to change any of the settings, especially the volume. Would love to just have buttons to turn it down instead of finding the app on my MacBook where the sound is originating from and turning it down that way.

Sound does come through the HDMI cable, and the monitors become a speaker selection.However, I also have these monitors connected to a desktop computer using the HDMI2 ports.  The desktop has DP and DVI output, so I am using converters to HDMI to connect to the monitors.  I then connected a 3.5mm audio cable from the desktop to one of the monitors for sound, but there is none.  It appears, from looking at the instruction manual, that I would need to be using the VGA port for that Audio In Jack to work.  I could put my DVI to VGA adapter on, but that would be sacrificing picture quality.  My daughter usually uses USB headphones with the desktop, but I am disappointed that the Audio In Jack isn't working the way I hoped it would.The buttons for these are on the back along the right side.  Yes, this is visible in the listing pictures, but I didn't really pay attention to that.  IMO, they would be better on the bottom edge, or front bottom edge.  Because these monitors are hooked to two sources, I need to be able to switch the inputs.  This now means I need to be able to access the back buttons, which is not as easy as I would like when the monitors are side by side.  I need to leave a gap between them, and turn one a little to access the buttons.  Just an inconvenience.Overall, however, the picture quality looks good so far, so that is an improvement from my older monitors.  The speakers sound like what you would probably expect from built in speakers.  Similar to the laptop speakers.",

Good refresh rate, picture isn't spectacular but it's definitely good enough. I use it for a mix of gaming and multitasking for online classes. Build and materials quality is surprisingly high for the price point. My biggest issues with it are a. the built in speakers and b. the fact that the monitor doesn't ask for the right resolution in a lot of games. The last issue probably won't be an issue if it's your only monitor, but it tries to use my native resolution from my laptop in a lot of games. Not a deal breaker but gets annoying when starting new games for the first time. The first issue is a little more annoying. I have to disable the audio driver for the monitor every time I start up a game, and in Warzone the chat audio will come out of the monitor by default while the game audio comes through my headset. Obviously, the speakers aren't great, but it doesn't bother me as I don't use them. Overall good for the price with just a couple issues.",

This is great, but due to the regular monitor mount standoffs are required when using a vesa mount. This itself is no big deal, so long as one is prepared to use the standoffs.The next catch, is that the top left, and top right vesa screws thread into some nuts that are actually threaded into the case, rather than directly into the case. This does not seem like a big deal, but when mine broke (my fault) and I needed my vesa mount back, those 2 screws came undone. This meant that to get my mount back I had to dissassemble the rear monitor panel and use a wrench to hold onto those two nuts.",2 people found this helpful

I am not going to babble on all of the cons and I am just going to give you my personal experience. So, a little side note is I received this monitor instead of a different model. I paid cheaper for the old model, and they ended up just sending me this so I'm not complaining about that. After a week or soI noticed one dead pixel, and now I have around 3 after half of a year. However, I personally am not too bugged out by these. I don't focus on them and they only show up in certain situations. But, if the pixels are going to bother you, dont buy this. I personally love this monitor. And the price? It's crazy how great this is for the price. I originally was skeptical about Sceptre as I had never heard of this brand and thought I might give them a shot. Now after half of a year with one of their monitors, I am ordering a second for a dual monitor setup. I ordered a different model than this original one, it was only around $10 more. I have to say, this gets the job done especially for the price. Give this a shot, especially if you want to save your money for other things or even two of these. Great buy, and trust me it is worth a shot!",

They came in, one had two giant dead pixels out of the box. Ordered a replacement. It came in, but the colors didn't match the other good monitor. Yes, I am a nerd, I made sure my graphics card and display settings were the same on both monitors. Ordered another replacement, plugged it in and the colors match the first replacement, leading me to think the original monitor (the one without the dead pixels) had the color issue. Whatever, I was happy the colors finally matched, that was going to drive me crazy.Except the 2nd replacement has a problem displaying blues. There are faint vertical lines when display most shades of blue. Hard to explain, but it looks choppy. Not sure what this phenomenon is called, it's as if colors are binding but I know that's not what it is. Remember the old CRT TVs? It looks like that when displaying blue. My guess is it's some sort of power issue. And yes I double checked with different HDMI cords and inputs/outputs. I'll be replacing this one too, hopefully the third replacement is the charm. Oh, and guess what, I just noticed a dead pixel on it too. Ugh.So far two working monitors with no problems other than one of them doesn't display color properly (who knows which one does it right). And two faulty monitors, one with dead pixels, the other with some sort of display issue and dead pixels. That's not a very good percentage.It is worth noting that with the most recent replacement the shipping box and the product box both had dings in them.The ones that do work I do like. But I can't handle looking at colors that don't match, that's not acceptable. But otherwise these monitors aren't terrible. Big, sturdy, and they do look good.

"Sceptre 24"" Professional Thin 75Hz 1080p LED Monitor 2x HDMI VGA Build-in Speakers, Machine Black (E248W-19203R Series)",5.0,Fantastic Display !  but one audio gotcha,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on January 30, 2022","Style: 24"" 75Hz Blue Light Shift | Pattern: Monitor",True,"No DVI input to monitor.  So purchased a DIV to HDMI adapter cable because wanted optimum video resolution.  (old PC has only DVI or VGA output ports).  With the Amazon adapter cable OR VGA cable; nearly perfect picture.  Very / very bright.  In fact had to reduce backlight and brightness settings to use in bedroom / office.  Monitor self detects input or can change manually.  OSD has about any setting you could possibly want. With VGA cable used 3.5mm audio input cable.  Works good.  When using the DVI to HDMI adapter cable got a surprise:  As soon as plug in HDMI to monitor; no audio thru internal speakers.  Turns out DVI does not output audio AND standard HDMI supports integrated audio; thus cuts off the 3.5mm audio input.  (no sound with DVI to HDMI cable)  For now reverted back to VGA so speaker audio would work.  Still pic quality is outstanding with 1920 X 1080: 75Hz resolution using either then DVI to HDMI cable or VGA.  Now internal monitor speakers are not boom box quality, but OK to watch an occasion You Tube or other presentation.  Will have to think about it, but might try small Soundbar along with DVI / HDMI cable or just use with VGA as is.  (resolution is same)  OBTW .. I like the blue tint settings feature;  had no idea what that was, but adjusting 10% blue light reduction really does make it easier on the eyes, especially in a darker room by reducing stark white backgrounds.  (much better)  In any case;  Very Pleased with this monitor purchase.  Highly recommended.",4 people found this helpful

The colors are bright, clear and sharp from the manufacturer. I didn't need to adjust anything.  This can be mounted on the wall or used with the included stand. All the hardware is included for mounting or screwing in the base. The included a good quality full size Philips screwdriver.I like the size. It's a big screen screen compared to what I had. It's bigger in both height and width. I've had other screens that were this size, but more wider and less height.  It looks like a TV screen. It's very lightweight. We bought this because we have several of their TV's and have had them for years.  They sell good quality  inexpensive TV's  with good picture quality that hold up well. so I decided to try their monitor when my old one suddenly died.  I didn't know they sold computer monitors.  In the past, I've always bought HP or Dell monitors.  I'm pleased.One thing I really like.....the screen resolution can be kept at optimal settings, but there is an option to make the text bigger.....like on a cell phone.  The text can be made a little or a lot bigger.",

Decision was based mostly upon the success and beauty of the smaller 20"" model I bought recently to support my Camera Security system.  I love the 20"" model so much that this larger 24"" was a no-brainer, especially for the price!Beautiful screen and resolution.  Supports HDMI which also includes audio for the built-in speakers.Super easy to take out of package and install in a couple of minutes.One thing I do not like about the Sceptre series is the Volume control buttons on the right-hand rear of the units.  It's a bit clunky, but certainly not a deal breaker.  Besides, I hooked up my external speakers with subwoofer to the audio out jack of my PC and the keyboard has volume control on it so this is now a non-issue.Great price and beauty.  Def recommend!",

Arrived in a timely manner, packaging was great, set-up a breeze. Whenever I open a box and see ""hardware"" I immediately drop a swear word or two. I did in this case as well but the step-by-step instructions were crystal clear and they even include a small screwdriver with magnetic tip - who does that?! It was so easy! I was thinking ""I really need to write a review for this thing"". And the icing on the cake was the card they include with CS phone number and website for support. Not hidden on the bottom of an owner's manual but a separate card that called out their support resources. (not that you'd need them; it's that easy to set up) That sealed the deal.

Because of COVID-19, I am mostly working from home and have a work laptop.  I am using this monitor as a 2nd monitor on the laptop.

One of the things that I like about this monitor is that it is very light weight and has a very small border around the screen.  Both of these are nice when using multiple monitors.My only complain is that the buttons to change inputs are on the back rather that the side or bottom (or better yet, the front).  This makes it a little harder to reach the buttons in a multiple monitor setup (not at all an issue if only using one monitor).",
