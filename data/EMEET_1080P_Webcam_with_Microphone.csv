The 90-degree view also ensures that you can easily capture everything you need during video calls.I love that this webcam comes with a privacy cover that ensures your security and peace of mind. This feature is especially important when it comes to sensitive information being discussed during calls.The setup process for this webcam is incredibly easy and straightforward. Simply plug it into your computer and it is ready to go! This makes it perfect for anyone who is not tech-savvy and needs a webcam that is easy to use.Overall, I highly recommend the EMEET 1080P Webcam with Microphone to anyone in need of a reliable and high-quality webcam.

As with most things, you get what you pay for. I don't use the built-in mic, so I can't comment on that, however the picture quality is just a scooch under ""okay"". I use a C920 at a different computer and its picture quality is comparatively excellent, but it did cost over 4x the price of this one, so I can't really complain! Make sure you get the eMeetLink software to make some adjustments (brightness, contrast, saturation, white balance, etc.) but don't expect $130 performance/software from a $30 webcam!",One person found this helpful

You just plug it in and it's ready to go. The camera view is pretty wide and natural sunlight makes the picture look super washed out, but looks pretty good in lower light. I use an edison bulb overhead at night and the quality looks really good. The cord is very long and plugs directly into your laptop with usb, it will not connect via bluetooth or wifi, which is fine for me. I am still learning about webcams and video quality, but this product suits my needs for the time being. Happy with the purchase.Update: after doing more research I now wish I had taken the time to find a webcam with narrower FOV because this camera shows too much of my background on cam and also distorts my features. It's still a great starter cam, but if you need it for modeling purposes or online spicy work then look for a webcam that has a narrow FOV closer to 60 degrees.",32 people found this helpful

Had to adjust privacy settings on a 2nd Windows machine to allow Zoom to access the camera before it would work - so beware that Zoom doesn't give you an error message other than something like 'cannot access camera' if your Windows privacy settings for the camera excludes Zoom.Picture quality is more than adequate, though not as good as the built-in webcam on my Dell Precision 5520. Really, no complaints here.  Again, be aware that Zoom shows you a very poor quality image - the 'Camera' application on Windows 10 will show you a much better image from your camera - so don't use Zoom to evaluate the camera.I was a bit worried that the audio level on the camera was too low. For starters, there's no opening on the case that I can see for a microphone.  (Some investigation would indicate that the entire top surface of the camera is coupled to the microphone. I have no idea how this does not produce distorted audio unless they have some kind of filter to handle it...)  And even with the input level turned up all the way (helpfully described in the included manual - see image), it doesn't record at a level that is as high as my 5520's built-in mic does. See Audacity image showing audio levels where first I was recording with the camera mic, then the 5520's built-in mic. But in actual testing (over Zoom), the actual audio level is less but not enough to require the other user to have to change their volume setting. The scenario I'm trying to avoid (with an old external camera) is that the audio level is too low so that your meeting participants have to adjust their volume (up) just for you when you are speaking.Physically, it sits nicely on top of my Dell 27"". The mount does cover the first 10pixels or so at the top of the screen as it hangs down about 1cm, and the monitor has a fairly thin bezel.  If I made a small square of material to put in there (maybe 2mm thick), I could probably get it to set up a bit higher and not block that bit of the monitor.  (Another camera I bought and returned had a similar mount, but would not actually sit in a stable way on top of this monitor due to the way the back curves from the top to the vertical back of the monitor.)Bottom line: this one is a keeper.** UPDATE **I have discovered that in a bright room (in my house, our South facing common room with lots of windows), the light levels are fine for people, but not for the camera. The image is completely blown out and not usable. Apparently there's no auto gain control.  Also, there's a question about this on Amazon, and the seller replies that there is not manual adjustment for this. So, don't plan to use this in a bright room or outdoors on a bright day.

I bought it because it seemed simple to use, looked like great video at 1080p hd, dual speakers, low profile, good price. Since it's a PLUG-N-PLAY, why not put these words first on the user guide so users don't have to figure out what all the documents are for, in addition to indicating on user guide a #5. eMeetLink for Windows/MacOS to learn how to adjust the camera.....ughhh, it was so disappointing to spend over an hour figuring this out only to find out, the webcam installed itself as soon as you plugged it in. One guide had me find the device manager and 'UNINSTALL' the webcam off my laptop, unplug,, then plug it up again......WHY???? On the EMEET website there are 5 downloads for the C960, with a couple of them having ZIP files that I extracted, and some having a different webcam model number on it. THERE IS NO SOFTWARE TO DOWNLOAD TO ADJUST THE WEBCAM. Adjustments, from what I can tell, are in the media app you're using the webcam with.....and that seems limited.This is my first review of this product. Tomorrow I begin the work week and will be using the webcam, which is why I bought it in the first place. I'll provide a review after using it for this first week. Hopefully I won't have to return it. YES the 90degree view is awesome and/or can be intrusive in a small place. Another issue was the ""Quick Start Guide' #4. Mount to tripod......well, why not put optional here. I had to find a YouTube video to figure out how to put on my laptop's screen. This C960 webcam better be worth all the time it took me to figure this out.10.7.22Adding to my original review....I used the webcam all week and I received good comments on video/picture quality and microphone. I also used it at night in low light, the image was great, no dullness, no darkness, I almost didn't need to use my video ring. The picture was clear and defined. At this point the only downside is that you can't zoom in. So although you're sitting a foot away, it appears like you're really far back from the camera. It's wide zoom, with from what I can tell, no way to center yourself in the middle of the screen. It looks a bit weird when everyone seems to be in a perfect position, centered in the middle of their screen and I'm sitting so far back....when I'm actually sitting as close as they are. Haven't decided if I'll keep it yet because of this.11.8.22 /Update - Reduced it to 2 stars.Ended up returning this one. Ordered model C970. Not a good experience with this one either. The picture wouldn't stop flickering and had to use the video ring a few times. Some of the same issues stated above with the C960, but this one was horrible in low light. It has an adjustable FOV and installed software to adjust the image parameters, but clicking on the menu items was almost impossible and did not line up with the cursor. I had little patience for this one after dealing with the first one, so I returned this one to. Order another brand (Logitech), quick delivery, simple plug-n-play, with adjustable FOV. I appreciate the size of this one over the two Emeet models. The width and height are not distracting. Fits easily on laptop screen top. Emeet models both had easy fit attachments as well.

I don't get it -- especially since I see screenshots in the reviews from people who fill their screens like you'd expect to with a webcam, and because my husband has the same camera, bought a year earlier, and he looks normally sized on screen. Another reviewer said the camera fine if you want a wide view of a conference room or want to show several people at a table. But for one person, I just look goofy. The camera is plug-and-play and easy to use, but since you can't adjust how tiny you look on screen, it's just a no-go for me. I'm going to buy something different.",41 people found this helpful

This is a VERY WIDE-ANGLE LENS. Meaning - if you want your head to be proportionally located in the center of the screen, the camera will need to be mounted within a foot of your face.

I'm sitting comfortably where I would normally sit - any closer and my eyes would hurt. This camera puts me wayyy back and I'm used to having my face be more squarely in the frame.SO - if you like this wide-angle lens, this webcam is for you. If you enjoy your ENTIRE room behind you in the frame, this is for you. If you like fisheye lenses, this is it.The lens quality is decent.. but you need proper lighting IN FRONT of you in order to get the best picture.

The camera lighting adjusts really well to the room lighting and you really don't need to have a light on to be able to see things in the camera during the night.I can't comment on the mic or mic quality as I have a headset and don't use the webcam microphone.The stand for this webcam was a bit confusing to use at first and I wasn't sure it would be able to stay balanced on top of my monitor but once I got the hang of it, I think it works quite well. I'm happy to say that you can adjust the angle of the camera quite easily without having to take it off your monitor or worrying about it falling. I like that the camera cover requires you to actually touch it the entire time you're opening or closing it because I know the cover won't fall down over the camera accidentally if I don't push it up the whole way.

The price was right on this eMeet C960 Webcam so I gave it a try.  I was shocked at how bad the color rendering was with the camera.  Using Zoom with a bright green greenscreen and a navy blue shirt, I became a floating head in the rendered screen.  The color vibrance and differences between the colors were not captured by the C960 webcam.  I looked dingy but the camera otherwise focused just fine.  If you plan to use this camera with a greenscreen, this is not the camera for you.  See my attached photo which shows a direct comparison between what my old Microsoft Lifechat camera captured vs. the eMeet C960 Webcam for the color of my greenscreen.  The vibrant green that the Lifechat camera captured was accurate.  The grey dingy green that the C960 captured was inaccurate and resulted in other colors also being similar enough to it that either the greenscreen was not detected or everything except my face was considered the background color.  This is an ok camera (not great) for no green backgrounds but not at all ideal for greenscreen situations.",2 people found this helpful

It is supposed to be plug and play, I gets.On the latest version of Windows 10 (this is what I have now when I got this camera, so I can't speak to prior versions), you have to adjust your ""Privacy"" settings to get this device to work, even though Windows see it. While that is not the fault of the camera, this point could have been included in the manual included in the box (there are two of these which say the exact same thing on the front cover but they are actually for different languages). I finally got on the phone with tech support, and they didn't even know this. I saw a comment on Amazon.com that mentioned this Privacy thing and that prompted me to dig into that setting.  So I wasted a lot of time on something as simple as that.  Tech support is supposed to call me back within 24 hours, which means I hear back on a Monday, since I called them on a Friday.  Useless.Second, and even more important, is that the video coming from this looks like crap.  There is no way to control anything. The image is over exposed and noisy.  The camera in my laptop works way, way better than this, so rather than using my desktop (which allows me to get the camera much higher up and hence gives me a better angle) and I going to go back to the laptop. Argh.The mount they put on this webcam does not inspire confidence. It is a weird mount for a monitor, as you can't lock it down. It does stay put, though, but it makes you wonder if you are missing something. The tripod mount is simple to use as you just screw it on. The webcam can angle down once mounted. If the video image were better, then this webcam would be great.  But it is not.The mics on this seem to be ok. They were working from the get-go and Windows didn't block that.  Hey, Microsoft - why don't you block audio too since you are blocking video by default?  How stupid are you guys?  And why didn't  you pop up an alert to say that the new camera device I just installed is blocked by default?  That would have saved me a ton of time.  What are you people thinking over there?  Ah, you're not!  I see.The only good thing in this story is that this is the only camera I could find on Amazon that would ship to me in a useful time frame due to Covid-19. Now, you can't find any webcams and they ones you do see are priced out of this world.",10 people found this helpful

The eMeet C960 unit had a high rating, many detailed reviews and a low price point, so really, what did I have to lose?This little honey of a unit arrived around noon today. I immediately unboxed, plugged the integrated USB into my laptop, and followed the simple Windows set-up directions in the enclosed booklet. It took all of 3 or 4 minutes from box to completed install.I tested the camera by starting an instant meeting in Google Meets. After a little tinkering with positioning the camera - love the hinged mounting method - and my small 6"" ring light, I am finally projecting a clear, well auto-lit picture with true color human/object rendering.

If any amount of light is coming from behind you it will dim as well.And item that should be considered, since this is a plug and use item, is the ability of the computer system to be able to adjust the zoom, especially if it can correct both focus and lightening. Otherwise to solve issue, one has to purchase a tripod to bring the camera closer instead of balancing it on their monitors when their work computers prevents them from downloading the Emeetlink PC Software.",11 people found this helpful

Just plug it in and it's ready to go.  Great!  Not everyone here is ""techy"", so I wanted something everyone could figure out.  The picture quality is a little Grainy.  Not what I expected from a 1080. The microphone seems to work ok when you are within 1-3 feet.Today, we used it in a Conference room setting. Everyone was sitting about 8 away from the Camera, and it was REALLY Grainy.  Not a good picture at all (kind of embarrassing) I expected the Microphone to perform poorly at that distance......and it did!.....lots of ""what?""s and ""can you repeat that?""Overall, this Camera/Microphone is just OK for a single user.

It has some sort of wide lens that from 2 feet away makes your head maybe less than 5-10% of the area captured.  It will capture floor to ceiling and at least 15 feet L/R at a distance of 12 feet or so.  Its purpose is definitely not a 1on1 camera for meetings- it should specifically be used to show an entire room.So if you're trying to use it to show a room, furniture or large items perhaps- this is the camera for you.  It would be a fantastic camera for indoor security for instance.  If you're trying to use it for zoom/meetings, it's not great.

Pretty clear picture! Decent sound from the built in microphones (this really surprised me)! Left to adjust itself, in some apps, you can end up washed-out or pale looking, as it seems to over brighten a bit. Conversely, this makes it better in lower light than many others. In apps that give you a lot of manual adjustment possibilities (like Skype), you can really improve the look. In other apps (like Zoom), it's easy to end up too pale, because the app lacks adjustments. There are in-between webcam effects and control apps you can use, but this camera come with no software, so keep that in mind. You plug it in, Windows 10 recognizes it, and it works automatically, plug and play! That's superb, but it means the ability to adjust things depends on the apps you use with it. Overall, this was a solid purchase. Just consider how you intend to use it. Windows Camera sees it, Skype sees it, Zoom sees it, OBS sees it, etc. It has a wider angle of view than many webcams, so I'm sitting a bit closer to it than I did to my old camera, to show less of the room behind me.

I don't normally write reviews so bear with me.There isn't really much I can say personally, but coming from a buyer who was recommended this by a long time user. It's definitely a great camera for those who want something simple and cheap to use. Even if you're a streamer.It's also probably the best camera you can find for cheap if you plan to use it for VTubing (Virtual YouTubing). Heck, it even has a leg you can use for it, so if you have a nice desk, you won't need a little tripod or anything if you got a good spot for a camera.As for its built in Microphone thing, I can't say anything about it because I never tried or ever had the need for it. Also, the framerate can dip but that's with anything, especially if you're running other programs. But overall the framerate is consistent.I recommend this to anyone on a budget who just wants a solid camera to get the job done. Naturally you get what you pay for so don't expect a miracle, but it does exactly what it promises (just because I gave it 5 Stars doesn't mean it's without flaws). Just have proper lighting on your face if you want to use it for VTubing.",

I haven't even started improving the picture quality w/outside settings in OBS etc yet....because I'm already sold! I imagine when I do start playing around w/settings - it'll be an improvement on already HQ picture/video quality.

If you are using Microsoft teams, Teams tries to default the audio to the webcam audio which might not be that good, I would recommend setting to using the external webcam and the computer audio in your settings2. The clip to attach to the top of the monitor\laptop is not very strong and while I have'nt noticed too many stability issues,I would have liked a clip which clasped on the monitor more firmly3. the base does allow it to tilt up and down a bit but not a lot which doesn't allow for a lot of customization.That said, it works great for both teams and zoom meeting so there are no regrets about this purchase.",2 people found this helpful

The viewing angle, at 90 degrees, is a bit wider than I'm used to but it creates a very clear picture and is especially good in low light, as compared to the built in webcams in all of my laptops. It's night-and-day clearer than the Dell and Acer laptop built-in cameras, especially if at night when there's no daylight.It works well with win10, and also linux. I've used it with Ubuntu, and MX Linux computers, where it's also been plug-and-play. The only quirk is that hot-plugging it on my linux laptop doesn't work so well, so I have to reboot with it attached. But only in linux -- it hotplugs fine when running windows.The mount clip works well with both thick desktop LCDs, thin laptops, and I've even clipped it to a music stand that was laid flat. A tripod mount would've been nice, but even if it had one, I don't think I'd have used it yet.The 1080p resolution is nice, compared to the laptop's built-in camera.

This is quickly overshadowed by the absolutely horrible audio quality from the built in microphone; which for some godforsaken reason was placed BEHIND the webcam, with max sensitivity on the input for the microphone you have to be yelling to even be heard through zoom... IF the microphone works at all. Often times the microphone will fail to function properly through zoom causing you to unplug and plug it back in to momentarily fix it; only to then find that now the HD option for the webcam is no longer functioning and will only work through original ratio; which looks horrible. And so, until you then close out of zoom and either restart the app or your system the webcam will not return to working properly. All of this is so overcomplicated that even when the device DOES work as intended, the microphone is horrible; however 6/7 calls a week I find that I'm being reminded by my peers that my microphone isn't working and I resort to using other devices as an audio input. This device is not worth the money; spend a little extra and get something that actually has software available for the system you are using it on....oh and the camera can not adjust manually or to anything close up; so if you're actually showing something on screen besides YOURSELF, you are SOL.TLDR: this webcam is mediocre at BEST.... when it works.. which isn't often.

I certainly wasn't expecting greatness at this price range, but the difference between that webcam and this emeet is night and day.this microphone on here is extremely clear. the other webcam made it sound like i was underwater. I'm no audiophile, but it definitely feels comparable to the built in microphone on my macbook pro (16"", late 2019) or my oneplus bullets type-c headset. I use the webcam about 2 feet away from my face for zoom calls and it works great from that distance, but I'm not sure how well it performs from longer distances or if you have a lot of noise in your background.the video quality isn't anything to write home about. It's acceptable and there's no fisheye effect which is nice, but otherwise the video quality is probably about the same as other webcams in this price range.

Unless you know what is better, you don't know what you're missing. The image color, sharpness and lighting of my S10's front camera was exceptional when viewed on my 32"" ZOOM link; while the C960 was as described: hazy, diffused; and even out of focus, no matter what distance I moved in or out to correct. Been a photographer for decades; and I've never seen a plastic lens on anything that compares to the real deal: GLASS. Too bad, because hookup and install was the only thing that was worth 5 stars. But the two stars I gave everything, was being generous.

I ended up putting an old 720p camera in it's place bc I couldn't rely on it.This may not be a problem with all of them and I did not spend a lot of time troubleshooting. This was just the only issue I noticed with it so if you have the same then please leave a review so people are aware.

If I find it's not the camera I will update this review.Other than that issue the camera came fast and worked right away and setup easily.

Same thing - colors were the same, no software downloaded upon plug-in to try and make setting changes. I will be going with a brand name for the next purchase. My husband has a similar camera - Logitech - and it's been working great for almost a year now.",

I have HD security cameras that are 120 degree field of view, and they are not this distorted.Another problem is, if there is any point source of light in the image, the whole image will be very dark.  My previous webcam had no problem with this (it is failing, thus the replacement).

Not terribly practical.I tried moving from one side to the other... nope. I did try moving to the camera and away... still nope.I was fuzzier than my shiba... and he was behind me yawning and then napping.There is no way to change the focus or settings on this camera - I tried going to their website and they have no software or anything to help with this webcam. There is no ring to focus with (it is fixed for looks only). I tried several times to restart it, I tried several ports, I even tried uninstalling and installing again. And as they say, we can always restart the computer. Nope, nada... nothing. Still fuzzier than my dog - and unless you are a samoyed, that is hard to do.So I am sending this back and will continue to use my iPad, which gets wonderful pic and sound, but the drawback is it is just tiny for the zoom meetings I do.

However as a streamer my lighting conditions change regularly (sometimes pink, blue, or other LED colors.) The auto white balance will cause my skin to look green or blue or red  depending on what color I use and doesnt correct itself when the lighting color changes, I've already wasted HOURS trying to fix it through the settings of my PC, my capture card and the lighting setup in my room. It doesnt matter what setup I have it always looks bad.I also am not a fan of how wide angle the camera is.I've had better luck with my playstation camera. Only problem is it is proprietary, so I can't use it on PC.Because of the white balance and the focal length (which is fixed) I wouldn't recommend this to anyone who is a streamer.

I would LOVE to return this item but it's outside the return window and Amazon won't budge on it. I recommend buying elsewhere and checking that you don't need additional software to adjust the settings.UPDATE: after expressing my disappointment about the situation, the manufacturer got back to say that if I download the app and send them a screenshot of the receipt that they'll reimburse me via Paypal. We'll see!UPDATE: Downloaded the webcam settings app, and it doesn't work as the manufacturer outlined in their tutorial.

If you're looking for something temporary and cheap, this is a good option, but don't expect it to be quality for long.  It will fail.  Honestly, just spend the extra $ and buy the name brand.  You will wind up saving money in the long run.",

Their response was: ""the lens material of the camera is all-glass, glass material can have a larger angle of view. You can adjust the distance between the image and the camera so that the angle is not too wide.""Anybody try to get a close-up with a fish-eye lens?? They look terrible.

I've tried this with two different USB-C adapters, in all four of my laptop's ports, thinking it might have been that but it's not. (One was an Apple make, one was by QGeeM for reference.)

OS (Ubuntu-based Linux), I had to change resolution settings within Cheese and Zoom in order to see the full field of view.

I usually love Logitech and their products but most of their products are rather expensive. I bought a Logitech webcam from Bestbuy for around 40 dollars. It was a 720p webcam with no auto-focus. I tested it out and was instantly bothered by the image quality. I thought that I was going to have to drop a large sum of money in order to get a camera with good image quality.Searching on Amazon for Logitech cameras I found an ad for this camera. I really was hesitant to get a ""no-name"" camera brand. In fact I was so hesitant that I avoided buying it. I thought about it for a good week, knowing that a 1080p Logitech webcam was 70 dollars. I finally decided to buy the EMEET 1080p webcam for 30 dollars to see if it was worth anything.I was amazed by the quality of the webcam if I am being honest, the picture quality is sharp, microphone is great (not too sensitive, not too drowned out either). I also love the fact that this comes with the optional cover for the camera as well. The price point on this is perfect, even cheaper than a worse Logitech camera was a great win. There is a nice autofocus too- I've noticed that it blurs out anyone walking behind you (when in a Teams or Zoom call) while keeping all the focus on the person in front of the camera.What I don't I love about this camera: the cord length. The USB cord lenght I believe is only about 3 feet, which for people like me who love cable organization, is not nearly enough room to tuck behind monitor and run down to the back of the desktop to plug in.This is a great product, I would buy again and I would reccomend!",
