"Logitech MK270 Wireless Keyboard And Mouse Combo For Windows, 2.4 GHz Wireless, Compact Mouse, 8 Multimedia And Shortcut Keys, For PC, Laptop - Black",5.0,Pure Simple,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on March 13, 2023",Size: 1 Pack,True,"I have been using this M&K combo for 2 months now.  Yet to run the included batteries out with daily usage and not turning the units off.  (AA and AAA) batts.  Durability: Don't drop it on the ground.  It has some flex.  Normal usage you're fine.  Noise: Key noise is about average.  On the quieter side of things, but not ultra quiet.  Longevity: Easy to clean, batteries last a good while/easy cheap to replace.  Connectivity: Just plug in and go.  No drivers, no bells and whistles.  Nothing to bloat up your PC  Why I bought it.  And IMPORTANT NOTE.  I use this to run a multimedia/server machine hooked up to my big screen TV.  I'm 7 feet away and don't want to trip over cables.  Don't have a mouse pad either.  The important note is this: Unlike some optical mice, this mouse works well on most surfaces.  So I'm on using the couch beside me to move the pointer about with no issues.  Keyboard is also a comfortable size to type, and to have just sitting beside me on the couch.  Cons: I wish it had a back/side button on the mouse.  It does not.",3 people found this helpful
"Logitech MK270 Wireless Keyboard And Mouse Combo For Windows, 2.4 GHz Wireless, Compact Mouse, 8 Multimedia And Shortcut Keys, For PC, Laptop - Black",5.0,Good keyboard with one problem,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on March 14, 2023",Size: 1 Pack,True,"When my 8-year-old K800 finally began to miss keystrokes I started to look for a replacement. The MX Keys stands out but has no buttons for volume and the calculator. It lacks the legs that are used to create a tilt and the notebook-like keys may not be something I want. Clicky keys, found on the G915 and other boards, seem to have a problem with failed keystrokes. I have experienced problems with double-strike keystrokes using the G915.I decided to try out the K270 and was not disappointed. It feels solid and has short-cut buttons. The keys work well, and the combination of keyboard, wrist pad, MX mouse and large mat looks impressive. I have used the keyboard for over nine months.The problem with the keyboard concerns power control. I have two displays and wanted the PC button to turn them off without putting the computer to sleep. Unfortunately, the keyboard itself causes the displays to start back up after about 5 minutes. An old, corded keyboard I tested does not do this and a thorough check of wake timers did not help. The button is now used for sleep mode.",One person found this helpful
"Logitech MK270 Wireless Keyboard And Mouse Combo For Windows, 2.4 GHz Wireless, Compact Mouse, 8 Multimedia And Shortcut Keys, For PC, Laptop - Black",4.0,"great set, until it stops working properly","Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on March 15, 2023",Size: 1 Pack,True,"I am going back and forth between the office and home to work. This is a great set for this as I have a similar set up in both offices with a riser for my laptop. Having one dongle for both the keyboard and mouse frees up the few USB ports for other items I may need to connect. After about 4 months, I noticed the mouse was getting sluggish on occasion. It was not as responsive as it first was, I replaced the battery. I was hoping to get a longer battery life from the mouse, I do turn it off when it travels so buttons are not pushed wasting the battery life. I read other reviews saying use a mouse pad, I have one in both places. Unfortunately, the mouse is very laggy and is not always very responsive to movement. The keyboard has no trouble and after about 6 months is still working perfect, no issues. I just wish the mouse would work better. Tried to find support through Lenovo, the store purchased from and I am having trouble finding their customer support information.",6 people found this helpful
"Logitech MK270 Wireless Keyboard And Mouse Combo For Windows, 2.4 GHz Wireless, Compact Mouse, 8 Multimedia And Shortcut Keys, For PC, Laptop - Black",5.0,Very basic but trouble free.,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on April 9, 2023",Size: 1 Pack,True,Doesn't rely on the unifying receiver and it's buggy software so this is a very stable platform. No worries about interference from Wi-Fi or other devices in the vicinity. It's a really bare bones keyboard and mouse so if you're looking for fancy features like the back lighting RGB lighting or any of that kind of thing look somewhere else. If you want a basic keyboard and mouse that seems to be pretty much bulletproof you can't go wrong here.,

This set was perfect for that because it’s as small as it’s going to get for a full-size keyboard.  The mouse is also very small, somewhat uncomfortable to use if you need it for long hours. I wish it was a bit bigger and more ergonomic.Pro tip: I was looking for the usb dongle inside the battery bay of the mouse where is typically stored, but it wasn’t there.

I ordered the MK270 keyboard and mouse.  The mouse works okay but the keyboard has been sporadic and now doesn't work at all.  I've put in new batteries and just purchased another USB Unifying Receiver.  Nothing works.  Before it died, it would sporadically accept typing and then would pause and then rush the typing leaving out letters.  I will never purchase another Logitech wireless keyboard.  From other reviews, it doesn't sound realistic to try to contact Logitech if you only get a bot and then are put on hold for a long period of time.",4 people found this helpful

"Logitech MK270 Wireless Keyboard And Mouse Combo For Windows, 2.4 GHz Wireless, Compact Mouse, 8 Multimedia And Shortcut Keys, For PC, Laptop - Black",5.0,"Decent layout, good range, find the USB connector in one side of the box!","Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on February 19, 2023",Size: 1 Pack,True,"I have used 2 of these units...The initial challenge is that the USB wireless adapter is easy to miss... it was in a side of the box next to a side flap, but nothing on the box said ""open this side"" or made that side seem special at all.  If you open the other side of the box, you can get the keyboard, mouse, and paperwork and never find the USB adapter.  There is a spot to keep the adapter inside the mouse (inside, past the bottom cover), but that's not where the adapter was during shipping.During use, this set has great performance at the ranges I have used.  I have used it with a projector with about 15 feet of distance from the receiving PC.  I have also played games on a different computer using one of these sets.  The keys may not have the response or feel that gamers may want, but this set works.  I have not had issues with pressing multiple keys at the same time games.  (Key rollover... problems occur on some other keyboards with combinations such as Shift+W+A... easily caused by running forward and to the left in a game.  This keyboard has not had any key combination problems so far.)",11 people found this helpful

My only complaint is the mouse doesn’t have any extra buttons, only the standard left click/right click/middle wheel button and while the keyboard does have a start/pause button and volume control, it’s missing the next/previous buttons. It’s not a deal breaker for me at all, just would have been nicer.The most important thing is that it works, and this does well.",

Keyboard has a great feel. The mouse is smaller than what I'm used to, but I'm now used to it, and it also works great too. Only problem I had was, it was shipped in its original box without a protective Amazon box around it. Box was in rough shape, but product was fine. One flap was torn completely off. Good thing it wasn't the flap holding the USB transmitter. If possible, get it shipped inside an Amazon box, just in case.",One person found this helpful

This is very much the case with this wireless keyboard and mouse combo, specifically model MK270, with 2.4 GHz. It took me less than five minutes to set this combo up. It was well protected in packaging, however, it was also easy to unpackage with a USB receiver that is small and frees up desk space.I use this same model at work. So, when I got to the point of needing a new combo at home it was a no-brainer to turn to Logitech again. This offers a full-size keyboard with a somewhat compact mouse that is comfortable and easy to use. This isn't a high-tech Logitech combo - so, I'm not sure that hardcore gamers would be happy with it but for most productivity needs it should work absolutely fine.The mouse is designed to work for both right and left-handed folks. The cursor is smooth and effective.I like the tilt legs with the keyboard. The keyboard is designed for 36-month battery life. The mouse is designed for 12-month battery life. Both offer on/off switches. Initial batteries were included.This combo has a 10-meter range and that's accurate (I tested it). It's compatible with Windows 10, 11 or later along with Chrome OS. The combo has a three-year limited warranty.This is really a very solid wireless keyboard and mouse combo. I've seldom been disappointed with Logitech products and that's true here.

I would probably give the mouse 5 stars and the keyboard only 3 stars, while it works pretty well something like 95-99% of the time, there are instances when it just won't respond.  I will type and nothing appears, sometimes it is just delayed, and sometimes what I am typing never shows up at all until I close out of everything, turn off the keyboard power and turn it back on and it finally gets going again.  Interestingly it will sometimes work in one program but not another at the same time.I appreciate having the standard 10-key and the quick buttons up top, for instance I use the calculator button frequently.  I have also been pleased with the battery life, as of this writing I've had the keyboard for over 10 months and don't recall needing to ever change the battery. I expect it to last much longer, and while I don't think it is unusual for wireless keyboards to last for a long time on one battery, I do appreciate that it isn't sitting there draining power needlessly.",24 people found this helpful

It must be RF interference from the NUC.  I've always had good service from Logitech products in the past so this was surprising.

"Logitech MK270 Wireless Keyboard And Mouse Combo For Windows, 2.4 GHz Wireless, Compact Mouse, 8 Multimedia And Shortcut Keys, For PC, Laptop - Black",3.0,"Excellent price, but it is low quality.  USB Receiver has very small range.","Reviewed in the United States on December 6, 2022",Size: 1 Pack,True,"This is a very cheap keyboard and mouse.  I got what I paid for.  My rating is based on quality, not cost.  It is a good keyboard for the price, but it does not come close to the quality of keyboards that cost a little more.  That is why I give it 3 stars.  I do not use my desktop often, so I did not want to spend a lot of money on a new keyboard.  I can live with this keyboard and mouse, but if I were purchasing for a desktop that I used often, then I would recommend buying a better quality keyboard and mouse, that will most likely cost more money.First the USB receiver is not good.  They claim 33 feet, but that is if there is absolutely nothing in the way.  I had it plugged into the back of my desktop computer beside my desk 3 feet from the keyboard and the keyboard would not work.  The mouse did work fine.  I plugged the receiver into the front of the desktop so that it would be in front of the desk and there were many dropouts and delays.  Finally, I plugged in a USB cable so that the receiver would be 2 feet from the keyboard and it worked.  So that is the setup that I will use with this keyboard.  If you have any object between the keyboard and the receiver, you will most likely need to buy a USB cable to bring the receiver closer to the keyboard.Second, the keyboard is very noisy and is not as comfortable as my previous Logitech Keyboard.  The mouse is optical, which is good for a low priced keyboard and mouse, but it is not as smooth as my previous Logitech mouse.My previous Logitech keyboard and mouse did cost about $60 and lasted many years.  It was smooth, comfortable, and quiet.  This $20 keyboard and mouse doesn't come close, but only cost me $20.  So as I said earlier, if you will use the keyboard and mouse often, I would recommend a more expensive, better quality keyboard and mouse.  If you will only use your keyboard and mouse occasionally, then this mouse and keyboard will be fine.",

I have a tenedency to place my iced tea on shelf above pullout keyboard shelf, so condensation and dripping has ruined past keyboards. (thank goodness I invested in cover). Otherwise this keyboard is great. Can take a pounding! My 9 year old Autistic nephew loves  learning games and tends to get a bit overexcited when he plays them. He hasn't learned to completely control his reactions, thus he will strike the keys too hard. Also, I like the spacing of the keys. Does well for my arthritic hands and fingers.

I work from home and tend to operate from my couch with the wireless keyboard laying on my lap + multi-monitor + touch pad and mouse.  This gives me freedom to move the keyboard around my workspace and you get used to the feel in time.  Keys are kind of spongy but otherwise fine.  Most annoying thing about it is when I pick it up with one hand I often accidentally hit the sleep key because the media controls / sleep key bar is so close to the edge they are easy to tap.  I have the keyboard on my lap in use probably at least 8 hours a day or more - even weekends - and it seems to be holding up after at least a year of use - battery seems to last forever.  I like to remove the Shift Lock key entirely from my keyboards and these are at the right price point - no guilt tearing the caps lock off - lol.

You can google logitech's issue with double clicking and you can find it goes back to some years ago.I am hoping that this mouse (M185) won't have the issue of double-clicking as it is not unifying-compatible.To the manufacturer, can you make this combo with M130-sized mouse?If this mouse double-clicks also, I will not buy a logitech mouse again.",3 people found this helpful

"Logitech MK270 Wireless Keyboard And Mouse Combo For Windows, 2.4 GHz Wireless, Compact Mouse, 8 Multimedia And Shortcut Keys, For PC, Laptop - Black",3.0,"really robust, it survived several punches before breaking","Reviewed in the United States on June 8, 2019",Size: 1 Pack,True,"after a lot of research,  which i always do even on cheap products i stopped on this.I mean it's from logitech, a lot of reviews(amazon and tech sites) are saying it's the best in it's field and price range and has survived years without any problems or even wear.When it arrived i plugged it and started using it within seconds, it felt so responsive and good to type on, lightweight and so on and so on.And sooooo robust, it even survived several rage punches before breaking and it's still 'working'.I'm typing on IT right now.Only downside is it can make perfectly balanced adult to emotionally break down.To back up my accusations let me tell you a story:I was emotionally mature person, which enjoyed coding.Well...before I started using this satan's acolytes regularly.I went to my summer house and took my pc with me, and left wea3(;it survived one more punch just right now)were was i.. yes, i left my regular keyboard and mouse at home, and it was the most unhealthy thing i have done for quite a while. It started .........lagging(i meant to write two dots here, the rest was provided by keyboard), a nd it was not normal lagging, it was specially targeted at my nerves, it exploited every inconsistency i had in my head. And it takes roughly 3-4x more times to get something done, if done at all, and after, you have to check back to ensure that keyboard didn't censor or add some of it's preachings  to your 'art'.besides that, the Keyboard has other characteristics as well, which includes but is not limited to:Zoning out, it stops responding, and does nothing, and after recollecting it's thoughts, it tries to fit in like it never left, just like a person when they don't listen to you and then laugh awkwardly after you finish, and it types whatever it thought you were typing, which ?/%$s up your code, or whatever you'fdre typing. (*sighhh, just did it again and i was staring at screen waiting for it to come back) Just a couple minutes ago it bugged enter key and went down several meters below my text before i turned it off.The Keyboard likes to take it slow, even postpone some actions sometimes, e.g: you try to alt+tab, nothing happens, then you do it with mouse, and continue your workflow and bam, it changes back. I won't start about mouse, but I will tell you that It will make you doubt you precision, and sometimes it scrolls up when you scroll down, and wise versa.In conclusion the keyboard with mouse forms a deadly duo.And not to appear too whiny:it does not behave like this sometimes, it ALWAYS behaves like this.I installed logitech software, tried chewing on and changing batteries, even though it said battery is good.installed logitech unifying software, which was supposed to fix unifying receiver problems, i't el(keyboard is really punchroof)it didn't even see my unifying receiver, said plug in your receiver and try again.unplugged all devices which could interfere with its connection,tried every usb slot, still same.I would say I want my mental heal backlnm ,kj(i don't know how much more it can take)but i know it's impossible, so the least I can do is to let society know  .. i want my money back!if you are reading this it means i somehow managed to hit that submit button with my mouse",5 people found this helpful

"Logitech MK270 Wireless Keyboard And Mouse Combo For Windows, 2.4 GHz Wireless, Compact Mouse, 8 Multimedia And Shortcut Keys, For PC, Laptop - Black",3.0,OK but could be better,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on July 27, 2020",Size: 1 Pack,True,"I liked the idea of having a single dongle to use with a wireless keyboard and mouse combination.  But the mouse has a pretty low-end feel in the hand, and the glides on the bottom are much grittier-feeling than those on the bargain Microsoft wireless mouse I've been using.  The wheel on the Logitech mouse also has sort of a gritty feel to the scroll, while the Microsoft makes a satisfying clicking sound as it ratchets, smoothly, on the scroll.  After about thirty second, I decided not to use the Logitech mouse, but to stick with the Microsoft and two dongles.Now, granted, this is a bargain-basement keyboard and mouse, so, if money's tight, it'll get the job done, but if you can afford better and you're a heavy user of the keyboard and mouse, then this might not be what you want.The keyboard is better than the mouse.  I'm using it to type this review.  But I don't personally like it.  I do like the fact that it has an on-off switch, so if you're planning to be away from your computer for a while, you could turn it off and saver batteries.  It's a little detail, but it's nice to have, and why not?They key placement if fine, but the key travel is much longer than I've gotten used to with my laptop.  That's definitely a personal preference issue, though, so it doesn't say much about whether or not YOU should want this product.I like the fact that the keyboard is no-frills.  I don't want or need an expensive keyboard with precision-engineered keys that make some special sound or have lights in them or behind them.  I want a keyboard that lets me type.  The separate number pad would be important for users who work with numerical data a lot, but its essential for me for one reason only--it allows me to make a long hyphen in Microsoft word by pressing the Ctrl and the ""-"" key on the numeric keypad simultaneously.  Otherwise, I would probably never use it, but I do use it for that function when I write and make textual references, so I always look for a numerical keyboard, and this keyboard has it.If someone would just design a basic keyboard with that one extra key, I'd probably buy it, though.But for me, the long key travel makes this keyboard a bit cumbersome.  I'll probably get used to it.  I think it's what I was used to once upon a time.  But I also use a laptop, and I've noticed that transitioning from one keyboard to another is actually a big deal, ergonomically.  If you use two different computers, you might want, as I do, to make the two machines feel very much the same to you.  Again, this is especially to be considered if your keyboard is a major part of your experience of using the computer.  For some people, it's not.Now, to be fair, as I type, I'm already adjusting to this keyboard, but I still feel confident that I could find one better suited to me.",2 people found this helpful

The keys give a satisfying feedback with each keystroke, and it feels sturdy for the price. The main things I dont like are that it's a single reciever for both devices and the mouse is overly sensitive. I have both a laptop and custom PC that I switch between, and because of the unified receiver with this combo, I use a different wireless mouse for the laptop. Sure, I could just connect this one and also have a second keyboard connected to my laptop but why? I understand the unified receiver is probably meant to take up less USB ports, but even most laptops have at least 3 USB ports now. Basic motherboards for custom PCs usually have at least 6, not including what your case may have built in. I know it may fit some nomadic laptop users' needs, but it's just not a desired feature for me.Mostly, though, my annoyance with this set come from the mouse being WAY too sensitive. I don't mean it flies across the page with the flick of my wrist; that's adjustable in the OS settings. Anytime I try to click on something (hyperlinks, buttons, applications, etc.) the mouse is so sensitive that it interprets the small, natural wiggle in my hand as I click as actual movement and typically tries to drag-and-drop or otherwise not register as a generic click. I've had to try to click things up to 5 times before it registered correctly. It's incredibly annoying when it happens. I've tried using a mouse pad and other surfaces to no benefit either. Plus, my other mouse that I use with my laptop does fine on both said laptop and custom PC on all surfaces, including fabric. It's just this mouse.Lastly, the range is mediocre depending on what your setup is like. I use my 55"" tv as a monitor and my tower sits on the entertainment center approximately 6 ft away. The receiver does well when plugged into the USB ports on the front of my case, but connection lags terribly if in any of the ports in the back (about another foot back).TL;DR: Great for price, mouse is extra sensitive, single unified USB receiver for both mouse and keyboard, range could be better.Pros:- Great price- Pleasing haptic feedback from keyboard- Battery life (going on 3 months at the time of this review)Cons:- Mouse overly sensitive- Unified receiver for both devices- The range is mediocre- No backlightIn the end, I'll be investing in a new mouse at the very least.",6 people found this helpful

"Logitech MK270 Wireless Keyboard And Mouse Combo For Windows, 2.4 GHz Wireless, Compact Mouse, 8 Multimedia And Shortcut Keys, For PC, Laptop - Black",5.0,One thing to look out for if you plan to use with a ComputeStick,"Reviewed in the United States on October 12, 2020",Size: 1 Pack,True,"This is a typically-good Logitech wireless keyboard and mouse.  I've had several in the past, so not my first appearance in this rodeo.  I've never had a complaint about them, and this isn't a complaint.The unit was purchased to use with an Intel ComputeStick STK1AW32SC I've had lying around for a few years.  I found that there is a great deal of RFI (radio frequency interference) that overwhelms the USB dongle, regardless of what they say about 2.4GHz dropout prevention.  This makes the connection intermittent, and both the mouse and the keyboard are impossible to use.  BUT the problem is easily corrected, and it's not Logitech's fault; I'm sure Logitech was not expecting this unit to be used practically on top of an Atom CPU :)The problem was solved by plugging a 24"" USB extension cable into the port on the ComputeStick, and plugging the dongle into the USB extension.  That got it far enough away from the ComputeStick (it's currently lying about a foot away) that there was no longer any problem with RFI.  A similar solution would be to use a USB hub and plug the dongle into the hub.  Given the frequencies involved, my guess is any USB extension cable of at least 6""-12"" in length would solve the problem; I just went with the extension I had on hand.I have not tested the unit with the Raspberry Pi, but previous experience with other wireless devices and the Pi suggests this is not an issue (or not as much of an issue) with the ""full size"" Raspberry Pi.  The dongle won't plug directly into a Pi Zero (no USB A port) so it's a non-issue for the half-size Pi.Again:  No operational issue once I got the dongle a short distance away from the ComputeStick.  Good keyboard/mouse combination; would buy again.",7 people found this helpful

This is almost always after a period of no activity, so I originally assumed it was a sleep thing, but it can happen fast enough that sleep most isn't the issue. Some research indicates this is a common problem for this model and seems comes up due to signal issues between the keyboard and the receiver (the mouse does not exhibit the problem). Any line-of-sight blockage - even if the receiver is otherwise at very close range - can create the issue, as can transmitting distances as short as 5' or so even if there is no LOS obstruction.Cycling the on/off switch on the keyboard is generally an instant fix - otherwise, you wait it out and see how many characters it dropped. The more lasting fix (other than using a different product) seems to be to have a USB hub that is in LOS and near the keyboard and connect the USB receiver to that.",

The BIOS screens do recognize them however, but nothing else does w/o the full OS running.The mouse is tiny, not fit for adult hands.  That part is actually a plus for me: These were intended for my kids use and so fit their tiny hands well.

It has the legs to tilt the keyboard up and make it more ergonomic. I’m also unfamiliar with “sleep mode” on the keyboard/mouse. So far, it’s a great buy at such a decent price and it’s working/advertising as described!I will update any changes while utilizing this product!",

I bought a USB-C hub adapter along with this Mouse/Keyboard combo so that I can plug the dongle and second monitor into the hub and only switch out one connection for all my peripherals. Well, the keyboard was working great, but the mouse was very laggy/jerky. It was very frustrating, even for mundane tasks like clicking the save button or closing out a program. I came to the reviews and saw one with the opposite problem (mouse works but not keyboard) and it mentioned line-of-site connectivity. So I took the dongle out of the hub (connected on left side of laptop where the only USB-C port is located) and put it on the right side (where my mouse resides)... Lo and behold!

Overall, it's been a reliable daily keyboard. I use it for both doing work and gaming. For the price, you can't go wrong with this keyboard and mouse bundle. Although I did notch off a star because some of the buttons can become a little difficult to press after wear and tear. For some reason, the left CTRL key is hard to press unless it is pressed at exactly the right spot which is the center. I've opened up the keyboard and cleaned it. Checked to see what's going on with the left CTRL key but it still does it. Another ding is that the printed letters, numbers, and symbols can be scrapped off. The letter C on the C key is coming a bit off.One thing I really have to praise this keyboard, is the battery life. I've been using the same battery since the first day I began using it.

I had previous experience with the Logitech products, since my wife used an old combo (I think it's the MK190, but a version that isn't sold anymore). We had problems with this combo in the past, but Logitech replaced it with no stress at all, and it's still working after more than two years.So, the MK270 surprised me. It's not  the cheaper one, and it's not shabby. The material has much quality, and the keys touch is comfortable. The Logitech products are very power economic (so your batteries usually endure a lot), and I expect this one to be the same, since it has an auto shutdown function when you're not using it.The size is good, a little bigger than my old one because there is an additional row of function buttons (play/pause, volume, home, email, sleep and calculator). You can turn on and off both mouse and keyboard using a button. Mouse is comfortable, a little smaller than my previous one but the perfect size. The click is not so loud, and the scroll is pretty smooth. The sensitiveness is also pretty sharp.

I opened the box, removed the battery tags for the keyboard and mouse, and plugged the dongle into my USB hub. When I turned on the keyboard, mouse, and Win10 laptop, everything worked without a hiccup!  Zero adjustments were required in the laptop's settings.The mouse is small, about an inch smaller than what I was using. I've found that I have fewer CTS issues with smaller mouses. The mouse is light and responsive, even without a mousepad.The keyboard has a soft clicking sound that gets louder if you hit keys harder. For those who do not type aggressively, the board is rather quiet. The keys feel spring-loaded for feedback, with a nice depth to the keys when typing. My laptop has almost no depth or feedback, which is why I use an external board. I'd definitely recommend this for purchase, whether connected to a laptop or desktop.",12 people found this helpful

I have several of them. In general I can highly recommend them! However, one was received without a second tact switch below the LHS shift key, causing it to stick unless hit exactly correctly. I've updated my star rating from 2 to 4 because this was probably an isolated incident. Other keyboards of this model did not have this issue.Original review: In most respects this is an excellent keyboard, and I would give it five stars except for one glaring deficiencies. Left hand shift key should be equipped with two tact switches under it, because it is needs to respond to a press anywhere on its surface. However, it only responds to presses on the extreme left of the shift key. On removing the key to find out the reason for this problem, I found that the right hand side of the shift key was lacking a tactile switch, and thus It was doomed to failure if pressed on the right hand side. I am unsure whether this is a manufacturing defect, or a choice made by some numbskull MBA in the hopes of removing a couple of cents from the manufacturing cost of the keyboard. If it is the former, that speaks of poor QC. If it is the latter, then it may be a sign that this otherwise excellent brand is starting to slip downhill.",One person found this helpful

I also should mention that I usually leave the keyboard and mouse on through the week and physically turn them off on the weekend. I plan on leaving my new one on 24x7 to see how long it lasts before I have to change batteries.",

Buy LOTS of spare batteries.,"Reviewed in the United States on June 26, 2021",Size: 1 Pack,True,"(Note: I've only used the keyboard from the bundle.  Haven't tried the mouse.)Nice Features:- Keyboard is extremely light; it's no harder to lift than a TV remote.- Keys are comfortably spaced (at least for me.)  Other ""light-weight"" keyboards are often cramped.- It's a complete Windows keyboard.  No messing with an ""Fn"" key to use the numpad or function keys.- Key action is good for an office keyboard.  It lacks the responsiveness of a high-end mechanical keyboard, but most users should find it comfortable.- Batteries are easy to remove and replace.  It takes AAAs, so finding new ones isn't a problem.The only downside is battery life:- The keyboard gets about 24 hours of life out of one set of batteries.- There's no automatic power-saving feature, only a manual on/off switch.- There's now ""low power"" indicator.  When the batteries run low, the keyboard starts to drop key press/release events.  This is very bad for some games.",

A wireless mouse and keyboard that work reliably and have good fit and finish. Yes, both feel kind of cheap and I wouldn't want to write a book using this keyboard.

Battery consumption is fantastic and exactly what I expect from logitech. Feel of components is at best good which is fine for the price though I wish it had a little bit more range... The mouse works fine when it comes to range to my knowledge but the keyboard can cut in and out from time to time. It's not like it becomes unusable but it does seem to struggle around maybe 8-10ft which can be a problem if you want to use it to turn use it comfortably from a couch when being the mod during movie night.

However I really miss having just a little bit of palm support. I had a small keyboard that this is replacing, but that one had just the tiniest palm support and it made a huge difference. In any case I bought one of those padded palm supports to supplement this and so now it’s fine. Had I known though I would’ve gone with the next model up that says it has a palm support.  That seemed so much bigger but I guess this is just a tad too compact. The main thing though, is it needs to work with the mouse as a combo. it paired perfectly.  plugged it in and instantly I was able to use it with my docking station.  Does what it needs to do.  I agree with other reviewers that the mouse is surprisingly tiny.  But didn’t notice that as much as the missing palm support on the keyboard.  So in the end it felt overpriced for what it ended up being because I had to buy the palm support separately but it works.  So, good enough.  Would buy something else next time though.",

I prefer wireless connections over guaranteed accuracy, so I was fine with this. The keyboard needed a USB Extension to get the receiver closer to my monitors since the actual tower is super far from the monitor I use. Once I got the USB extender for the adapter, all the input lag and missed inputs fixed themselves and it is working as intended. Be cautious, if you value high fidelity for typing, this has a ~.05% chance of missing keystrokes unless the USB receiver is close. After 3ft it started to stutter on me. Additionally, when my PC was processing a lot of things, it seemed that the range of the USB with high fidelity input dropped, thus why I opted into shortening the range by extending the receiver closer to my monitors. I use 3 monitors, so likely a normal consumer will not need the extender, but besides that it’s perfect for my needs.Mine came with batteries, so that was a convenient plus.

When I broke my first mouse from the same set (by repeatedly dropping it - oops... clumsy :)), I ordered a second set and it arrived very quickly - on Christmas Eve! - like a Christmas miracle :))) A miracle because the product is marked as ""out of stock"" until a month from now (and I was willing to wait!), but it still arrived quickly. The product itself is really good - both, keyboard and mouse are very comfortable, work great. The price is right and the packaging is awesome (I love how they thoughtfully put the USB part into the flip on packaging so that people don't miss it. I would know to look for it inside the mouse, but not everyone can guess that - so, it's quite clever to put the USB part visibly into packaging itself - can't miss it). Batteries are also supplied - great deal. The product works great and can last and last if you don't abuse it like I tend to by dropping things... My husband has the same set, and I am very happy with my replacement set too. Highly recommended!",

These are not for gaming.  No part of these are good for gaming.  They're wireless, which usually means a slight input lag, the keys are big and clunky and the mouse lacks all features you would want in a gaming mouse.These are great for work, though!  They complement my surface pro nicely and the full size keyboard is great for when I'm doing dual screen work where I have more space to spread out.  Overall, I love the mouse but the keyboard keys sit a bit higher than I normally like and I wish they had that lower profile but that's probably more my issue of not reading the product as opposed to a downside to the keyboard.  I've had this for 3-4 months now and I haven't seen any wear nor have I had to change the stock batteries and I've accidentally left these on so they must have a decent sleep or low power feature when not in use.Recommended for those who like higher set keys on a keyboard!",

What I mainly wanted to add is that I have seen a lot of folks who had trouble with the keyboard, and I wanted to address that. The keyboard and mouse are very sensitive where you put the USB dongle vs. the mouse and keyboard, and what port it is in (power?). I saw the same symptoms others wrote about, with the keys lagging my input, and was able to correct it by moving the USB dongle to another port.Normally this would mark the unit as a problem, but again, this is the only such wireless unit I have found that does not eat batteries, so in my mind it is worth it.

Shame on you, Logitech! Returned, ordered exchange - same thing goes again - rubber pegs are missing. That makes no sense!Otherwise, good (could be good!) cheap keyboard.

I opened the mouse again and removed the little unlabeled black thing again. Apparently someone figured that would be a good place for it when shipping.I noted a male plug, searched around the back of my computer for a slot for it, plugged it in and everything works great.MY POINT IS - If the manufacturers would include that tid-bit of information on a card in the box it would have saved me (and I'm sure other neophytes), I lot of frustration.",

The mouse, however, is horrible.  For starters, you have to download a separate program to control the mouse....except it only adjusts the mouse speed and lets you turn ""smooth scrolling"" off or on.  But a totally separate program install for a ""combo"" product.  And there is a ""firmware update"" for the set according to Logitech....but when downloaded there are no recognized products.  Crazy.The mouse's main problem is that it is ridiculously inaccurate.  As others have noted, trying to drag in a straight line is nearly impossible.  I'm not using this for gaming either, as some of the other reviewers have noted.  I'm talking about trying to use this mouse with Excel spreadsheets.  Dragging to highlight or copy/paste, etc. is very frustrating.  The mouse is always just a hair off, so I am consistently one row off for example, and trying to drag a little lower sends you past.  And it seems to double click Excel when switching windows, which minimizes it... a lot.Best advice, unless you want two dongles and do a separate keyboard and mouse, spend the few extra dollars and get a Microsoft or better combo.  This is truly ""get what you pay for"" with a nearly useless mouse (but again, the keyboard is great).  And before anyone points it out, the mouse is 18 inches from the dongle, so if there's interference I can't see how (and keyboard has no lag or issues at all, same dongle).",2 people found this helpful

My findings are as follows:(1) Instructions in the packaging were minimal.  Normally that would not have mattered as it is just a wireless keyboard and wireless mouse, right?  Since there were no instruction I went online to troubleshoot when the keyboard would not work.  I was almost certain the disconnect was on my end!  There was some help through the manufacturer's website  but there was beginning to feel frustration because it wouldn't work!  After almost an hour with no connectivity on the keyboard, I changed out the new batteries that came in the box...magic it worked..(2)  The keyboard itself is light weight and kind of flimsy.  It is serviceable but I am not impressed with the quality.  Keys are not back lit but it is functions properly at this time,(3)  The wireless mouse is kind of a joke.  It is smaller than a standard mouse and is very flimsy, light weight and just feels cheap.  The first thing I noticed is that the spinner does not work smoothly.  I am almost certain that it is going to break BUT again it is serviceable today.  Note: Previously I was using anther full size Logitech mouse.  It appears that I will have to tie up a second USB port if I want to use that one.  Bottom line is that the keyboard and mouse are functional (thus the 3 stars) but they have the feel of something cheaply made.  I got what I paid for on this purchase.  I have not decided if I am going to return it or keep it.  I definitely would try a different model or spend a little more money on another option",

In fact, I was thinking Logitech was around for a while and could have done much better. It claims to have programmable keys, but it didn't come with software, so I assume I have to figure out on my own where to download it, or whatever they are programmed to do is all you really get by way of choices. Which isn't really ""programmable"" by definition. Just the standard home button, email button, and calculator button. Also a PC power button which I assume controls the power options in the start menu but so far doesn't work with my computer (Windows 10).My two biggest gripes are:1] The height adjusters on bottom of the keyboard don't seem to raise or tilt it forward very much at all compared to other keyboards. It's seems to be about 3/8 of an inch lower. So not very ergonomic.2] There is no light to indicate when Num Lock or Scroll Lock is on. How much money could they have possibly saved in production to need to leave that out? I use my Num Lock key all the time, so it is pretty annoying when I can't see what state it is in by just looking at the keyboard. Same with Scroll Lock which I use to turn off my X-Mouse Button Control app. So when my girlfriend is not looking, I am going to switching this one for her Jelly Comb keyboard. She's not going to care about these deficiencies, but I do.",

Not Unifying Compatible.,"Reviewed in the United States on February 22, 2023",Size: 1 Pack,True,"Honestly it's just OK. I should have read more into it, but the pair aren't compatible with unifying technology. I wanted to purchase the K270, but at the time, saw that the MK270 (Mouse and Keyboard combo) cost the same. Decided I might as well get a backup mouse essentially for free. Low and behold... that model (K270) has a unifying receiver and is compatible with existing unifying receivers, this junk does not... even though it's the exact same design, same model (almost I guess, there's an ""M"").Logitech, I like your stuff, relatively good quality, but what is this? I wouldn not have purchased this combo have I known it's INCOMPATIBLE with the unifying receiver. I'm not even asking for one (unifying receiver) as I have a few lying around, but you made it intentionally incompatible.I would have returned this instantly had I known. Now that I have opened it, I guess I'll just suck it up (23 bucks for an OK keyboard and a joke of a mouse). If you are purchasing this because it's Logitech and you think it is compatible with the unifying receiver, I rate this a 1/5. Ignoring the brand and simply judging it as an independent item, not expecting the unifying receiver to work... 3/5.

Cons: PC sleep key in middle of media control keys (easy to mistakenly hit when using in lap), CAPS LED is the only LED (NUMLOCK LED would be nice, though I realize battery life was a consideration), and for some reason kb stops working at odd times and only starts working again when the kb is sharply jarred against the surface it is sitting on (ie picked up an inch and dropped).  It seems to be a dropping of connection, not kb sleep mode, as there is a buffer dump of previous key presses as soon as responsiveness resumes.  Kb is 10' from the USB receiver, but with unobstructed LOS. Though I have experienced this several times, it is still a rare phenomenon and I haven't ruled out environmental influences yet, so I am hesitant to declare the kb is at fault.

It's smaller then I like (I have small hands and it's small), and it is so sensitive.  I'm constantly left or right clicking when I don't want to because I'm trying to rest a finger, but the second you drop your finger--it clicks with the slightest touch.  It's absolutely maddening.

Horrible feel TO ME,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on July 2, 2022",Size: 1 Pack,True,"I have had Logitech combos for years, mostly the MK520s. On one of my sets the mouse started going crazy so after 5 years i figured it was time for a new set. I purchased this set even though is was a bit smaller (not as deep) and a little cheaper. Boy was that a mistake. Don't get me wrong, I really like most Logitech products. The first thing I noticed was the caps lock doesn't light up, which is annoying when my cat walks on my keyboard and then I need to put in my password. I could probably live with that but the keys protrude more than I'm used to and seem to be higher and less rounded/smooth so I'm constantly hitting Control or Windows key as I type I also constantly hit F11/12 when I backspace. The mouse seems to be a bit smaller, maybe it's just a small difference in shape but it doesn't feel right, When I move the cursor it seems to (skip or hesitate). The scrolling wheel tends to jump back up a few lines when scrolling down. This is not what I expected. I will keep it as a back up but invest in an MK0520 or MK540.

Even with the USB receiver within sight of the mouse & keyboard, there was so much lag that I just couldn't work with it. I replaced it with a wired mouse and keyboard.**ORIGINAL REVIEW** This combo was working fantastically when I set it up, right up until today when I got a couple of hours into work and the keyboard basically stopped working. I turned both mouse and keyboard off, replaced the batteries, and disconnected then reconnected the USB receiver. Still having the same problem. The mouse works wonderfully but the keyboard is non-responsive.I started searching Amazon for another product, wanting to stick with Logitech but thinking maybe I should just get something at a higher price point. In a review of a similar Logitech product, someone explained that they had the same issue but corrected it by placing the USB receiver within sight of the keyboard and mouse. So, I tried this and it has seemed to fix the issue. (I have my monitors on my desk with the keyboard & mouse, but everything is run through my laptop which I had stored under the desk. I moved the laptop to the top of my desk.)It's all working fine now, but I'm still only giving three stars because this is not ideal. I'll continue to use this for now, but will be replacing it in the near future so I can have my desk arranged the way I prefer it to be. Prospective buyers.. be aware that you will likely need your equipment arranged in a way that allows the USB receiver to be within sight of the mouse and keyboard (so if you have a computer tower that's stored under your desk and would be difficult to place elsewhere, you'll probably want to go with something different)",186 people found this helpful

I am extremely technically proficient but I missed this little crucial part.  I forgot the Rep's name who helped me and resolved it in about 20 seconds on the phone but I appreciate competent customer service rep's like the fellow who helped me just now.  Thanks.  Otherwise you can't go wrong with Logitech keyboards and mice.  I have been using them for years for custom builds and wherever a wireless device can be used.  Sometimes in the business place you want your mice and keyboards to be wired so employee's don't loose them and render a work station useless.

It fits her hands perfectly, and the keys are very responsive.  The keyboard is a standard format, with some extras too.  My wife took to it right away.

Here are some issues you may want to consider before buying.  There are no caps lock or num lock lights.  The little bumps on the F and J keys are almost non-existent.  There's a bit of something there, but not what I'm used to when feeling for those keys to keep my fingers on the home-row.  Also - this keyboard and mouse DO NOT use the Logitech Unifying Receiver or software.  The receiver that comes with the product does not have the Unifying logo (first clue) and the keyboard and mouse do not work with a Unifying receiver (if you have one).  If you think that is the case, and use the Unifying software to try to pair the devices to the receiver - you will have no luck.  You will need to find and install a different app from Logitech to pair the devices.  Windows 10 on one of my computers did find the receiver and install the software automatically - without the need of the special Logitech software.**Update**  I was wrong about the Caps Lock light - there is one.  There is not a Num Lock light however.  No Num Nuts light either (or I may have been warned about my Caps Lock light observation when posting my initial review).",

Until I went into a game though.  The latency was bad. I'd press a game key and nothing would happen. The mouse put me behind or in the wrong place. Did some basic research that didn't amount to anything but one random page suggested issues with the receiver plugged into USB 3.  Easy enough. I used an open USB 2 port and all issues went away immediately.  In game and out.  USB 3 ports are easy to spot: If it's in a dark spot shine a light on it and look for the blue tab.,

"Logitech MK270 Wireless Keyboard And Mouse Combo For Windows, 2.4 GHz Wireless, Compact Mouse, 8 Multimedia And Shortcut Keys, For PC, Laptop - Black",2.0,Updated but NOT Better,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on January 29, 2019",Size: 1 Pack,True,"Logitech in their infinite wisdom has dropped the unifying dongle from this product. Instead you get a single dongle that only works for this keyboard and mouse. Even worse, they have replaced the Set-Point software with something new called ""Options"". This download is 3 times the size of the old Set-Point software, and the first thing it does is ask you to create an account and to share your history! No Thank You!  Of course the ""Options"" software only controls the mouse, so if you want to map the keyboard, you still need to install the Set-Point package!  I uninstalled the ""Options"" package since this mouse is a very basic mouse and can be controlled with Microsoft generic options. The only function that you lose is the battery monitor.While I have always been a fan of Logitech products, this change from the unifying dongle and this keyboard in particular are changing my opinion. The keyboard has a pretty solid feel to it, but it constantly drops keystrokes. Since that is the primary function of a keyboard, I cannot recommend it. Also, the mouse that comes with this package feels really cheap (probably because it is cheap).  Those 2 problems combined make this package not a bargain. I am very disappointed that Logitech is dropping the unifying dongle and software. That change alone is enough to make me look elsewhere for keyboard and mouse replacements. Overall, not recommended!",506 people found this helpful

None of the corner cutting on substandard-sized keys such as <backspace> or midget arrow keys.  Like the soft rubber feel of the mouse scroll wheel that allows prolonged use as compared to hard plastic knurled scroll wheels that cut into one's finger.  Mouse scroll wheel itself is annoyingly loud and the ratchet feedback to one's finger is distractingly bumpy.  The on-off switch on the mouse is missing the green-red color indicators.  Will definitely dump the mouse and replace with one that has a silent scroll wheel.  The unifying receiver works as expected except that the contract manufacturer skipped printing Logitech's brand and labels making it that much easier to misplace.  Nice battery life for both key & mouse.,

If I had to call something out as a ""CON"", it would be that the mouse is one of their smaller designs, so I wouldn't want to use it for long periods of time with my big hands.",

Because I was so frustrated by thinking I had not received the USB I ordered another keyboard mouse combo from another company.

You can't rest your palm on the mouse - you have to grasp it with your fingers.  I suspect I'll get used to it.  They keyboard is nice, requires a slightly firm touch, but fast enough.  Speed typers may need to slow a bit.  The border of the one that I received has a slightly sharp edge to it - perhaps that would wear over time - but it feels like it has the potential to cut something.  That might sound trivial, but put it in your backpack and it might wear the material sooner than it should.  I do like the power buttons on both the keyboard and mouse, and these units work both the mouse and keyboard from one USB dongle.  The dongle stores in the mouse.  If you have several dongles from other products, take the time now to somehow mark this one's source (e.g. paper under tape) so you'll always know what dongle goes with which device.

This mouse and keyboard are really well made and keys are very responsive on both mouse and keyboard. I can’t give any feedback on battery life yet but everything else seems really good. I am using this on my business computer and both of them being wireless helps a lot. For work this is awesome but I won’t recommend this for gaming for 2 reasons 1. It will definitely drain batteries faster no matter how good they might be.  2. Games especially FPS games require a dedicated gaming mouse with zero input lag.

Interesting to ship something with the batteries and leave the device on so they are completely drained when they get to the customer.Since I can't actually use then at the moment I can't give much if a review.

Tried changing speed and replaced battery yet neither fixed the problem. Decided to contact Logitech technical support, explained it was the mouse multiple times and even gave them the serial number yet each time they responded, they were talking about the keyboard. How's fixing the keyboard, when nothing is wrong, gonna fix the mouse? So after roughly 5x's of this I was pretty perturbed and sent them a not so nice email capitalizing the word mouse each time hoping to get through their thick heads. Still waiting for a response so I can tell you this is the last Logitech product I buy no matter what the reviews say.... I tried contacting them at least 2 more times and each time was ignored so now I'm stuck with a wireless mouse that doesn't work correctly. Now, being on a limited budget, have to either replace the mouse or get another combo (which I'd prefer) and I can definitely say due to product support, I'll NEVER buy a Logitech product again no matter how good the reviews.",6 people found this helpful

Keyboard feels like a $15-20 keyboard, about as expected. Mouse feels like a $5 toy, not as hoped for, but for the price as a bundle not too far out of line.But build quality and feel don't matter because neither works as expected.Tried in multiple ports and at multiple angles and ranges. Both only work intermittently - you have to wiggle the mouse many times to get the cursor to go where you want, and the keys only work about 50% of the presses, especially if you leave the keyboard untouched for a few minutes, like it has a sleep powersave and then has trouble reconnecting to the dongle.I assumed this was just because of the distance, because I was originally trying about 20 feet apart, and there were no obstructions, even had the PC case oriented so it was direct line of sight from the dongle to the kb/mouse and new batteries had no effect.But moving it to 5-6 feet made no difference - I still can't use the keyboard without multiple presses for each keystroke, and mouse glitches out periodically as if it's a bad signal.For office use, it's frustrating and a productivity killer.For any gaming needing faster more accurate inputs than something like chess, it's unusable.Compared to an Apple wireless kb/mouse pair on another system in the same room, it's night and day. Of course those cost 10x as much, but no matter how cheap a thing is, it should still do what it's built and advertised to do. Maybe it won't feel or look as nice, or do it as well, or last as long as the premium versions, but it should have a minimal level of usefulness.This keyboard doesn't type reliably.This mouse doesn't move the cursor reliably.",11 people found this helpful

That’s about it. I called Logitech for tech support and it was the least helpful experience. It first asks you for your order number, but my Amazon one was not accepted. They then transferred me over to someone who gave me support ticket. I was then transferred over to another person who I read back the ticket number they just gave me. This will happen everytime you call because you can’t just give them your ticket number. After the call and some emails, they sent me a new receiver. I followed all the directions that came with it as well as other instructions I found online and on their website. Still did not work. Reached out again to the Logitech and turns out they gave me the wrong receiver. This is not a new issue since I just read a comment saying that you need a specific receiver and this particular one does not work. Sending mine back and I’m looking forward to not having to deal with Logitech ever again.",3 people found this helpful

That's going to cause me to burn through batteries. Anyway, this a minor issue, the real issue here is the mouse.The mouse.It's terrible. The lag is constant. Constantly clicking somewhere and the mouse doesn't get there in time. Constantly trying to move the mouse somewhere and it just stops for a split second and clicks the wrong button (often closing tabs or messing up something you're working on). I don't like wireless mice because no matter how many people say ""oh I don't have that problem with this one,"" there's always lag and this one is no different.I've tried everything. I've googled why my mouse is lagging all over the place. I've made sure to close unneeded browsers. Made sure to close unneeded apps. Made sure to keep other USB unplugged when I don't need them. I've restarted my computer. NOTHING works. The mouse constantly lags (my computer is not old and when I use a wired mouse I have zero problems).

I get it, plug the dongle in, and the keyboard flat out doesn't work. Change the batteries, still nothing. Mouse occasionally worked, but then would randomly freeze, making it terrible for gaming and essentially anything else.Ordered a replacement set to see if maybe if just gotten a faulty one. It happens. Nope. Keyboard does work this time, but once it goes to sleep it takes 5 seconds or so for it to start input, and it'll pick up from the last keystroke, meaning you'll  often have to rewrite sentences or words. Mouse is essentially the same as the last - works fine for a few minutes, then spazzes out and starts freezing for 5 or so seconds.Not sure if it's just a poor Bluetooth connection, but I doubt it as I have zero other problems with Bluetooth devices on the computer and the tower is directly in front of me at no more than 5 feet away. But it's impossible to recommend at all for any use. You'll die playing games because the mouse will just stop working midgame for no reason, leaving you as a easy target for enemies. You also can't use it for basic functions either for the same reasons.Logitech needs to take this trash product off of the market immediately.

First a gripe that Amazon ships a ""cereal box cardboard""  thickness package  without a corrugated shipping box.  Product box arrived bent, crushed and battered, but the product was ok.The real reason to take 3 stars off is what could be a positive (minimal and efficient packaging) being a little to clever by half.  The USB receiver is packaged in an end slot tab - when you expect the product to be ""in"" the box and not part of the box. Clever but not clear.  Might work is is was indicated to open the end flap. Nothing on packaging to indicate that one flap is ""special"".  So 50/50 chance consumer will open wrong end, slide out the mouse and keyboard and NOT find the USB receiver.  I was about to contact Amazon that the USB was missing when I examined the other end and found the USB sticking out of a slot in the cardboard end.  Again, clever, nice use of minimal packaging. But really the engineers at Logitech should know this is a non-standard way of packaging and then CLEARLY indicate the end of the box to be opened.

The mouse is compact and my hands are too large to easily work with it2.  The mouse clicks are quite loud3.

"Logitech MK270 Wireless Keyboard And Mouse Combo For Windows, 2.4 GHz Wireless, Compact Mouse, 8 Multimedia And Shortcut Keys, For PC, Laptop - Black",1.0,Doesn't last - technical issues,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on September 3, 2020",Size: 1 Pack,True,"Old review (5 stars in August 2020): My old MK270 mouse wore out after y-e-a-r-s of high use. I ordered another brand of keyboard when the MK270s were out of stock, but I hated the other new keyboard (fingers kept tripping over the keys) so I re-ordered this MK270 and I love, love, love it. Works just like my old one. Plug-and-play. Even though the years-old M185 mouse quit (some odd left-click button oddity), I still use the old MK270 keyboard from my last set with a secondary computer.Updated review April 2022 (1 star): My set #2 lasted for about 6 months before the mouse started acting bizarre. It took about a month of jumping through ridiculous administrative hoops for tech support to get them to send me another set (May 2021). The warranty process was so frustrating that I swore I would never buy another Logitech product even though the keyboard layout and feel was perfect for me and I like the mouse size. Set #3 lasted about 6 months as well before acting strange again, and I've been limping along with it for a further 5 months. Today I've finally had the last straw with this set and will be buying from some other manufacturer. Whatever quality I experienced with my first set (bought years before 2020) has been replaced with cheap CRAP! If it had simply stopped working, or worked intermittently, then I could deal with it. But the problem is random twice-clicking (not double-clicking) when you've only clicked the mouse once. So when you're closing one window, it randomly twice-clicks and causes multiple windows to close at the most inopportune times, often discarding all your open work. It's just not worth tolerating its defects anymore.",

But the keyboard doesn't even pass as ""operable"" due to the bad engineering..... Scrolling up, i see several people asking about certain keys sticking.... well, surprise! They ALL do sooner or later. Essentially the design depends on a ""tall"" key sliding down a plastic post and, guess what? It soon starts ""sticking"", but more like, because of poor design, there's enough slop in the fit of those plastic parts that they cantilever and actually jam, not making contact (for me, it's the Space Bar & Enter). I don't know about you, but it's really upsetting to have to proofread everything you type and invariably, there's missing letters, the space wouldn't go down so, words crammed together, yada yada.....  Secondly, do be aware that this is a mini-mouse! if you have large hands, be prepared for cramps in your hands.

On the other hand, the keys are loud and clunky.  No wrist support actually has a large impact on comfort.  The mouse is undersized for my average-sized hand and the wheel is also loud (weird).  When I'm sitting about 5' away from the receiver the keyboard takes a long time to initiate with my PC (it's almost like i have to wake it up if I pause from typing for 5-10sec by jamming on some random letters.  Then it picks the signal up and will keep up with the keyboard as long as I keep typing.  I'm assuming this is due to a low signal quality from the keyboard.)

Maybe it's unfair since there's a desk and most of the tower in the way. TOO BAD. In rel world, this means a 2 foot range.

Logitech is my preferred brand of keyboards, however this particular model does have loud keys. According to the description it has ""whisper-quiet keys"", but in my opinion, that is not the case. In comparison, at my office I have the MK750, and those keys are truly ""whisper-quiet"". I do also feel like the mouse is a little smaller than a normal desk mouse, I would say it's closer to a travel sized mouse, or laptop mouse. This combo also does not have a unifying receiver which is a huge miss for a logitech product.",

The dongle is about 4 feet behind me, completely exposed for best reception. So, wireless distance issues shouldn't be a problem.Sadly, the keyboard goes into a mysterious ""sleep mode"" after less than a minute of inactivity. Additionally, it takes anywhere from 10-30 seconds for it to kick back into active mode. Then, it spews out 10-30% of what was previously typed during standby mode, and goes haywire.The ""PgUp"" and ""PgDn"" keys don't work at all. The entire NumPad is non-functional.I only wanted this combo for the most SIMPLE of uses. It's not even worth that.That's $20 that would have been better spent on a nice meal somewhere. Oh well. I guess you get what you pay for. It's not even worth the effort to return this mess. I will look for a recycle center and turn it in for a merciful death.The mouse is fine.

I had Amazon send me another one as I thought these Chinese Mfg's forgot to put one in between lunch break and quitting time.  Ok.  installed the battery on the first mouse.  Usually from previous models you get that little blue light stating its on.  Nope.  Not working either.  Checked battery installation and that was checked.  Luckily, I had Amazon send me another unit when I could not find the first one's USB receiver.  Wish I checked the answers on this page before that, but then again, the first mouse did not work, nor did the keyboard. It just sat there like some Moo Goo Gai Pan.  So I batteried up the second keyboard.  Same thing.  I could not believe I had back to back duds.  Ok, here is where good old fashion yankee ingenuity comes in.  I banged the mouse on top of my desk.  Some how it came to life.  Still no little blue light at the bottom of the mouse.  Maybe it only shows up when the battery dies?  Can't remember  After banging the mouse several times the keyboard caps lock key showed up.  Banging the keyboard did not work. I am now in business.  Of course I have to send the duds back to Amazon.  I may have loosened some sticky rice inside the units circuitry or something.  Who knows?  What fun!",17 people found this helpful

Well, I get the new board and checked the model number on the back and it shows K270 however they type-feel is NOT the same and check out the logo...it says ""LOGI"" - is it a fake?  How did a fake come in a perfectly sealed Logitech box?  I'm freaking madder the more I write this review.  So frustrating!  Does it work?  Yes, but after a trip to Wally's, they have a whole stack of the exact same model for $19 bucks!  I just feel ripped off and so disappointed in Logitech for doing this.",9 people found this helpful

The mouse still works well, but the keyboard started acting strange.

Sometimes the keys would repeat so quickly that a momentary press would lead to a dozen characters. Replacing the batteries with brand new batteries didn't help, either. I think a company like Logitech should consider making fewer models of keyboard, and the ones they do make should be reliable so that a keyboard failing prior to the computer it's attached to would be almost unheard of. Clearly, they don't care, because my last logitech wireless keyboard failed after three years, which is too short. This one only lasted 8 months.

First off, the instructions were non-existent. I had to go online to find something and Logitech referenced buttons on the mouse that did not exist. Second, the USB transmitter would not function from the back of the computer so I had to use up one of the ports on the front. Third, the keyboard was sketchy from the beginning. There were long periods where it just seemed to be sleeping and I just couldn't get it to type. In less than a week, I was back to my wired keyboard. Well at least I had my mouse. Nope, later that same day it started acting up too. Now I'm back to both of my old units. And, the thing that kills me is the good ratings and the cheap price. The good ratings got me to buy it but the cheap price makes it too expensive to return it. I'd have to travel 30 minutes to a place where I could ship it and the trip would cost me more than the thing is worth. So now, in order to buy a decent set of units, I'll have to spend at least $30. I'll be out $50 for a damn keyboard and mouse. I'll just stick with the wired pair.",

These devices are NOT compatible with the Logitech unifying receiver. If you're unfamiliar, it is a program/feature that makes it so you can connect multiple Logitech devices to one dongle.I already had a mouse that had a unifying receiver and I was annoyed when I had to use the receiver that came with this unit. ESPECIALLY because the mouse is terrible. The mouse slides around without any drag to it whatsoever. Which means the slightest bump or if you have it on a tilted surface, it slides RIGHT OFF. The lack of any traction makes it almost impossible to do any real gaming or art or video production work.The keyboard feels like it's made from cheap plastic and that I could break by pushing a key too hard. The raised notches on the letters F and J can hardly be felt, so I actually have to look down sometimes to see where my hands are. It's missing controls a lot of new keyboards have.Save your money and buy something a little more expensive with a unifying receiver.

It often misses the first few letters when beginning to type.  The mouse tracks poorly and has no ergonomic consideration in its design.  Crazy thing is that batteries are included.  No one expects batteries to be included so it bewilders me why they wouldn't have spent that little extra on decent components that are expected instead.",

So I used the dongle provided with this keyboard and there are select keys that are not working regardless of what I've done.  Its consistently having issues with the same keys, its either defective out of the box or just garbage or both. Yes I've removed the working unifying dongle and tested this on different ports, deleted items from device manager etc,...  NONE OF THIS SHOULD BE REQUIRED!!!!!!!In summary the old k400 keyboard that I have which works flawlessly with a different dongle vs this new product has way better key feel than this unit.  The chorded generic mouse and keyboard you get from a Dell feels like better quality than this.  If you have Logitech products already and your using their unifying dongle avoid this garbage.",

"Logitech MK270 Wireless Keyboard And Mouse Combo For Windows, 2.4 GHz Wireless, Compact Mouse, 8 Multimedia And Shortcut Keys, For PC, Laptop - Black",1.0,The keyboard is very unresponsive and stopped working 50% of the time after about a week,"Reviewed in the United States 🇺🇸 on June 2, 2021",Size: 1 Pack,True,"The keyboard is nice and I really like it at first. Then after a week, I noticed it not being responsive and skipping what I was typing or just not typing at all. I would have to sit there and continue to press keys until it decided to register what I was typing and once it started up again, it skipped half of what I was typing.  This is EXTREMELY irritating when you are using it for work and typing fast. It literally made me have a lot of downtime not to mention frustrated me beyond belief at how poorly it works. I changed the batteries twice and have the key board right next to my PC so its nothing to do with that. Just a cheaply made bad product. I talked to my coworker and later learned that he and another employee had the same issue with theirs which happened to be the same brand and type. So its not a defect, its cheap and not worth the price. i will order a more expensive brand next going forward and returning this immediately.",

It is advertised as being able to be used up to 33ft(10M).  I don't think so because we had line of site at 15ft and it still had huge issues.  Removed all other 2.4GHz equipment from the area plus went to 5GHz on the computer wifi.  None of this helped.  Sent it back and replaced with a Dell KM7120W which is flawless in the same environment. (the Dell mouse/keyboard are bluetooth as well as 2.4GHz).  I think spending more money is in order.If you are going to use this item sitting 2ft from the PC it may work in your application.  If you are not using 2.4GHz equipment anywhere near this keyboard/mouse, it may work for you.  It is advertised to do far more than it did so the rating is terrible.",

Online support is very thin.2) The number '8' key on the numeric pad barely works - I have to slam it down hard for it to register.  Poor construction quality, clearly.3) Online support is either confusing or inapplicable.  For instance, having issues with your receiver, download the Unifying Receiver software.  Which I did, and it says I have unifying receiver connected, which can't be true since I'm typing.  Or, try to install a firmware update?  Similar issue - no receiver or device detected.

Flimsy and light, but functional.I noticed the big problem after a couple of hours of usage. Two or three times during that duration I would type and none of the keystrokes would register. It’s like it had some process to run (thus blocking the typing) and then it just spammed all of the keys that I typed all at once, once that process finished. I don’t know if this problem was rooted in hardware (an interference issue with Bluetooth devices nearby) or in software (some keystroke logging/batching? That would be shady.)

In trying to figure out the problem, I opened the mouse to change the battery and saw a plug-in adapter. I removed it and saw that it was not plugged into anything -- it was simply stored there.  If there had been any instructions, then I would have discovered this sooner.  Once I plugged this plug into the adapter cable that I purchased separately, that plugged into the charger connector on my Samsung A20 phone, then magically, the keyboard and mouse insisted on working.  I didn't have to do anything more -- the mouse and keyboard worked perfectly.  Combine this with the Actiontec Screenbeam adapter to mirror my phone to my TV, the TV becomes the monitor.  So, $44 for that adapter plus $22 for the keyboard and mouse and a few dollars for an OTG-type adapter cable -- VOILA! -- my phone is a computer!  My 4K Onn TV from Walmart is a cheap, yet high-resolution 43"" monitor for $178 (which I already had).  Who needs a computer?  Your phone already is one!

It has been over 10 days now of waiting to get approval for warranty replacement (it supposedly has a 3 yr limited hardware warranty) and it does not seem to be coming anymore. They no longer respond to my emails. I have purchased many Logitech items over the years and thought they were a good company, but seeing this lack of honoring their warranty has made me rethink their products and customer service.

This set is an unmitigated pile of junk. Latency and drop issues aside, I have average to slightly below-average sized hands, and the keyboard is almost too small for me to use. Spend the extra cash and buy something better.",

So, when I was looking for a wireless keyboard/mouse, this was my first stop. I ignored the bad reviews, trusting my past experience and expecting Logitech to over-deliver, as usual. That was a mistake: believe what everyone else is saying about the insufferable reception quality. I have reconfigured my work station, getting the keyboard a direct, unobstructed line of sight to the Bluetooth receiver, still to no avail. I am getting flashbacks from the 90s, when I would walk uncooperative remotes directly up to the TV or VCR and try mashing the buttons from an inch away (of course refusing to use the face controls, since that would be admitting defeat). Hard to believe for what is otherwise functioning hardware, but this keyboard/mouse combo isn't even worth the $24 they're charging.",

The keyboard was a bit larger than I expected but it was OK.  The keys were OK and functioned well.  After a few days of using the combo, the mouse started to not track correctly on screen.  I thought perhaps the battery needed replacing which I did but the issue continued.  I checked the underside and found that the emitter was not showing a light like my other Logitech so I assume there was something amiss there.  I cleaned it, and played with the battery connection a bit, but nothing helped so I returned it.",One person found this helpful

I have used Logitech for ages because I have always had good experience with their products.  This was a Big Disappointment.  The lag time was terrible.  I would type a few letters and see nothing on my screen, then type a few more and all of a sudden they would all show up.  The mouse skittered around and would freeze for a second before resuming motion.  I did not have this issue with the wireless mouse (also Logitech) I had been using.  I can't imagine anyone being able to cope with this issue.  After 15 minutes I was exceedingly frustrated.  It's going back.  Not sure I'll even try another.  This was AWFUL!",

This item works with one USB unit for both the mouse & keyboard, which in my opinion may have lead to it's connectivity issues. Both are basic design. Mouse hasn't given me any issues.Definitely find another product. Nothing is more frustrating than trying to work from home and your keyboard crashing on Monday morning. It's not worth the lost hours. Very disappointing.Attempted to return, but Amazon's return window was May 31st for a mid April purchase. Which I found very odd.

Regardless, I tried 3 different sets of batteries and two different laptops and cannot get any movement of the mouse or strokes on the keyboard to register.

When it was plugged into the back of my monitor, the keyboard and mouse would often lock up.  When moved to the side of the monitor, it was a little better, and when I tested moving my keyboard and mouse right next to the dongle it seems to work great...I think I need to order a 1 foot USB extension cable for the dongle.[Updated] . After trying out a USB extension cable for the dongle so that the wireless stick is only 1-2 feet directly in front of my keyboard and mouse, there seems to be a slight improvement, but overall, the quality is terrible, so I'm dropping to 1 star.  I think the problem is only on the keyboard side, but it regularly loses connection or buffers the input.

Even worse than that is that 3/4 of the time it will either leave out some of the keystrokes completely, input them in a random order that is different than typed or most often it is a combination of both.

The keyboard is super glitchy and not very reliable. Super frustrating to type out three sentences, look up and realize that half of what you typed was actually captured.

As I use the keyboard, it responds very slow with the actual keystrokes, including missing letters in the beginning, requiring to erase and start over.  (I am an average speed keyboard typist). I replaced the batteries with Keyboard & Mouse, when I first started using this Logitech keyboard, thinking that perhaps that was the issue.

Still the same piece of junk it was when I bought it, only worse.  The lagginess has gotten to the point where my mouse and keyboard are nearly unuseable.  It took me almost 10 minutes just to type these four sentences.",

I tried turning on and off, replacing the batteries, etc. It doesn't work. But outside of the 90 day window so Amazon says to contact Logitech-- which is sure to be a pain. I guess I should've expected a cheap keyboard to work poorly. I cannot recommend buying this, better to save yourself the trouble and spend a little more and buy one that actually works.",
